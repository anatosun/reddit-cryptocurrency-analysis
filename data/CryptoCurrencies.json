            "text": "I\u2019m not saying Bitcoin is a bad investment. On the contrary. Every portfolio should have a little BTC in it.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is don\u2019t expect to make huge amounts of profit off of Bitcoin if you\u2019re a small time investor. Or at least don\u2019t expect to make more than what you\u2019ll be capable of doing with alts.\n\nBTC still makes decent profits. But you\u2019re better off with alts since we consistently saw them do 10x and even 100x on a weekly basis the past bull market.\n\nAnd while alts can be more volatile than BTC, if you know exactly what to choose to invest in and when, you\u2019ll have a much higher chance at making WAY more than you would have initially made with BTC.\n\nLook at HBAR for example. I think they have WAY more potential than Bitcoin especially with HBAR foundation now expanding the ecosystem at an unprecedented rate to the point where they allocated more than $500 million solely for developing the Hedera ecosystem.\n\nI won\u2019t start with that \u201caltcoin season is right around the corner\u201d bullsh#t cause no one is remotely sure about that. But all I can say is that we\u2019re already starting to see alts coming out with some bullish announcements and projects on the daily.\n\nMaybe take that into consideration next time you want to invest? Prices are still very low. Good luck guys.",

But the days of +1000% are far removed from the reality of Bitcoin today. It has become a common staple of the markets and a standard the world relies on, and every day as a result it's getting ever so stable.\n\nThat being said, I have made plenty of immense profits off of it, but for people just entering the market with insane expectations, please face reality, you will make a lot of profit but it'll be nowhere near 2x or 3x...\n\nWhich is why I see many beginners rush the field running towards small tokens and startups. Nothing wrong with that in principle, but people behind these token leverage these people by creating pyramid schemes and false tokens.\n\nOne might see it best to buy new tokens only off a launchpad of sorts, such as solanaprime as now they even have an insurance fund in place to protect their investors. They might even want to avoid small caps all together, but in case they care to venture there, one must take serious precaution.\n\nBe safe out there, face reality head on and limit your expectations.",

This event takes place every year on January 3rd. It is a special time when all Bitcoiners are called upon to simultaneously withdraw their Bitcoin from the centralized exchange platforms to take possession of their Bitcoin's private keys.\n\nIn the latest issue of the In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter, I also explain why in this year 13 after the creation of Bitcoin, everything will be different: [**https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/we-are-year-13-after-bitcoin-network**](https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/we-are-year-13-after-bitcoin-network)\n\nBitcoin was created to give us a way out of the infinite vicious circle in which we have been locked for over 50 years. We now have hope for a better future world in which the people have regained power over the fruits of their labor.\n\nA world in which we can once again have access to leaderless hard money that protects us from any kind of censorship. On this unique day, it is therefore essential to remember why Bitcoin was created, to measure how far it has come, and above all, to look to the future, because the future that awaits Bitcoin is simply phenomenal.\n\nHappy Birthday, Bitcoin! Happy Proof of Keys Day to all Bitcoiners!",

Under the current system, El Salvador was condemned to survive by begging for aid from the IMF or the World Bank.\n\nNayib Bukele understood the why of Bitcoin and decided to seize this opportunity to change the future of El Salvador and its people. The people of El Salvador overwhelmingly support Nayib Bukele in what he is trying to do for the country.\n\nEl Salvador's bold choice has already changed the way the country is seen around the world. Everyone is talking about El Salvador and more and more entrepreneurs will be coming to El Salvador to participate in this experiment of building the first Bitcoin Nation.\n\nWho knew where El Salvador was before Nayib Bukele made this choice? Very few people. No one was talking about El Salvador. Bitcoin is already a game-changer for El Salvador and this is clearly just the beginning.\n\nWhile the IMF or the World Bank scoffed at Bitcoin a few years ago, now these institutions are getting scared by the growing possibility that the Bitcoin experiment will succeed in El Salvador and motivate other countries to follow Nayib Bukele's path.\n\nTonga is talking about adopting Bitcoin by the end of 2022, as are other countries in South and Central America. In short, something is happening and the IMF feels the danger mounting for its obsolete system.\n\nRather than letting the people determine for themselves, the IMF is threatening El Salvador saying the country must abandon Bitcoin. The IMF's threats only justify, in my opinion, the very existence of Bitcoin and the absolute necessity for the world to have this alternative system available.\n\nSince El Salvador will logically refuse to obey the IMF, what's next? Will America eventually orchestrate a coup in El Salvador to overthrow the government and end the Bitcoin experiment? How far are the powerful people in the current system willing to go to prevent countries from expressing their free will in monetary and financial matters?\n\nEl Salvador must continue to resist outside pressure, and other countries that will opt for the Bitcoin system in 2022 must do the same. The world is changing, and the first countries to adopt Bitcoin will be the ones to benefit the most in the future.",

Just to add, basically the website that did us in, we made $3000 profit off of a $2000 investment, they demanded we pay (upgrade our account) $10 000 in order to withdraw our money, so we've lost it all as they have blocked our account unless we make payment. Are there sites who won't do this? I understand there's different packages available sometimes but its a bit ridiculous to be charged $10 000 to be able to access our money. They didn't make this clear at all when we contacted them in the beginning when depositing our money.",

Extreme fear continues to prevail in the market, whereas just a year ago the price of Bitcoin was around $40K as well, but everyone was in euphoria mode.\n\nSame price, but different feelings.\n\nThe reason? Most investors have a hard time stepping back and realizing that in March 2020, the price of Bitcoin bottomed out below $4K during the liquidity crisis at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNow that Death Cross is here, some people are wondering if it's time to panic. You need to ask yourself the right questions about the current market conditions. Are you anxious? Stressed? Sad? Happy?\n\nAnswering this question honestly will help you to get a better handle on your Bitcoin adventure. Some people are anxious, while others are taking advantage of it to accumulate more. In my opinion, it is an opportunity right now, but that's just my opinion. No guarantees as always, everyone has to see what their interests are to make the best decisions.\n\nGoing back to this Death Cross, many think it is a Bearish signal. In the last issue of the In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter, I explain that it is much more complicated than that. There have been 8 Death Crosses in the history of Bitcoin: 4 have seen the price of Bitcoin fall in the following months. The other 4 saw the price of Bitcoin rise in the following months.\n\nAs you can see, there is nothing absolute, since it is 50/50. This won't help you know how to position yourself, but it will tell you that it is out of the question to panic in the current situation. What you need to look at is the on-chain data with BTC accumulation increasing and less and less BTC on the exchange platforms.\n\nThis is not yet having an effect on the price of Bitcoin, but it will in the coming weeks. Patience is the key in this phase of the market.\n\nIn terms of resistance to hold for the current Bullish scenario to stay valid, it is the $39K-$40K area that must hold. As long as we are above it, no worries. If the price of Bitcoin were to break $38K, things would get more complicated as I explain in the last issue of In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter: [**https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/death-cross-is-here-bitcoin-goes**](https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/death-cross-is-here-bitcoin-goes)\n\nFeel free to share your feelings and opinions on the current market situation.",

This is an opportunity to show you, if you needed it, that Bitcoin will have played its role perfectly in 2021 by being increasingly favored by investors: [**https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/war-against-inflation-bitcoin-beats**](https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/war-against-inflation-bitcoin-beats)\n\nBitcoin has posted a +75% performance, while gold decreased by -7%. An obvious sign that Bitcoin is gaining momentum over gold as the preferred store of value now.\n\nAnd it will continue to do so in the future, as the world becomes increasingly digital.",

The second was a more modest gift: for the price of Bitcoin to break through $52K resistance.\n\nThis almost happened in the days after Christmas, but a rejection took place with long positions liquidated. The price of Bitcoin hit the bottom of the range again at $46K. We will probably end the month around $48K.\n\nThis was something to be expected as we are in a vacation period where retail dictates the trend. We will have to wait for the return of the institutional investors next week for the trend to emerge from this range.\n\nThe more this accumulation range continues, the more aggressive the shakeouts will become, the more bearish the sentiment will be, and the more violent the next bullish wave will be in my opinion.\n\nNothing guaranteed as always, but a feeling I have right now and that I share with you in the last issue of In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter: [**https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/bitcoin-price-rejects-52k-again-accumulation**](https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/bitcoin-price-rejects-52k-again-accumulation)",

After the unfair battering it has received over the years, let's take some time to use our knowledge lf it to defend everything it's brought the world. \n\nUnfortunately for crypto, first impressions stick for some time. BTC initially gained a tawdry reputation in its early years as the currency of choice for illicit activities \u2014 favored by dark web users, ransomware hackers, drug traffickers and money launderers worldwide.\n\nBut, the world has changed since the first Bitcoin was mined back in 2009. There are now more than 18 million of them in circulation, and more than 90,000 people have $1 million or more stashed away in Bitcoin,\u00a0according\u00a0to cryptocurrency data-tracking firm Bitinfocharts.\n\nNow is the time to recognize that while there are inherent risks, cryptocurrency is also a force for good in the world. In an age of plummeting savings rates, this relatively new asset class offers all of us the opportunity to invest in crypto without traditional barriers that exist in traditional finance, no matter how much or how little money we have available.\n\nThese risks are also dwindling by the day with the introduction of insurance funds on IDO incubators like soIanaprime, the investor is not as in danger as before and there are more safer options available in the market to choose from. \n\nA large number of people do not even have a safe place to store their hard-earned cash.\u00a0According\u00a0to World Bank data, 1.7 billion people globally do not have a bank account. Many of us take for granted the ability to move money around through credit cards and bank transfers, also the ability of sending sending large sums to our friends and family with a tap of our smartphones, but for the unbanked, this is not doable.\n\nLet's not forget that crypto is also democratizing finance. There are low barriers to entry with no need for a broker or a high net worth. Anyone can invest and create wealth for themselves. As a result, people are learning about concepts such as annual percentage rates, lending and borrowing, and the history and purpose of money.\n\nCrypto can also shield citizens from economic turmoil. Venezuela is a prime example where many\u00a0citizens are already suffering high inflation\u00a0and the impact of United States sanctions that also affect their banks. They are increasingly converting their wages into crypto and using the blockchain for money transfers and payments.\n\nFor developing countries, Bitcoin is an excellent way for society to eliminate corruption because the community can track any Bitcoin transaction in the public ledger when people use the cryptocurrency to transfer money.\n\nCrypto\u2019s mainstream acceptance is almost already here, but many people still have unfounded fears we have to overcome to truly push mass adoption forward once and for all.",

Since then I've made a ton of mistakes, and I genuinely wish someone sat me down and taught me some things before I entered here. \n\nFor starters, I wish I knew that no 2 exchanges are the same. Every one has a different quality and a different way it works. Every platform you use is different than the other and that's just something you have to learn early or you'll be stuck trying to fix some things that are features of the platform. \n\nI wish I knew that Bitcoin and Ethereum were not for everyone. I mean yeah they're excellent tokens in their own right, and I've had my share of success of there, but they're not right for everyone. If you were looking for massive peaks of success you are far better off scouring the small caps market. \n\nI wish I knew small caps were risky. Small caps are a huge risk and if you say they aren't you are just lying to yourself. A lot of the time they just end up in rug pulls or are just built that way... Some platforms understand this, and take the necessary precautions, as in the case with Solana prime, but most platforms don't give a damn. \n\nI wish I knew mining is so expensive. I tried my hand in mining early and I went all out on it, Splurging on GPUs and computers trying to get the best result possible. What no one tells you is that there are massive maintenance costs involved in the matter that you will find trouble keeping up with. \n\nI wish I knew more about crypto before I entered, and that's 100% on me, because the internet was there in front of me, I just didn't use it. I should have. If you are new to the market, please educate yourself as much as possible.",

But in the past year I\u2019ve noticed that crypto somehow has become incredibly politicized. \n\nAs guy who considers myself to be fairly \u201cleft\u201d oriented politically, it can be funny, to downright frustrating and disheartening to see how rapidly crypto has been painted as some anti-environmental,  right wing boogeyman that is only for \u201ccryptobros\u201d. The most ridiculous part of this, is, most people who take these stances have almost little to zero understanding of cryptocurrencies AT ALL. And won\u2019t even listen to any sort of conversation about it. I\u2019m not even talking about trying to get people *in* to crypto I\u2019m just trying to explain to people that me DCA\u2019ing into projects I like doesn\u2019t make me some \u201cchud\u201d hell bent on destroying equality and our planet. \n\nIt has been very eye opening, as someone who is considered \u201cliberal\u201d to watch all my peers who pride themselves on being thoughtful and data-driven, mindlessly parrot propaganda-tier talking points anytime crypto is brought up. Do many of you experience this? Do you have any links or counter arguments to the age old \u201cbitcoin mining is destroying the planet\u201d, I find it hard to believe that crypto mining is more harmful than the mass production of consumer targeted personal use vehicles or factory farming, (but am of course open to being wrong about this)",

Me driving my car, in fact the entire total of all the cars driving around in the world, is a drop in the bucket compared to the CO2 and waste produced by the MANUFACTURING of cars, and manufacturing plants in general. So me running one computer with a couple of GPUs is like nothing, it uses barely any more power than just running a normal computer all day.\n\nAre you a monster for enabling the industry by participating in it with trading? How is that any different from buying a car, or eating meat, or buying/using any product that was built in a factory? This doesn't make any of these things okay, but where do we draw the line? \n\nCrypto only seems to stand out because it doesn't generate anything of intrinsic physical value, but in my mind neither does the minting of physical money, which like crypto has value for its function in mediating a global trade system.\n\nThe problem here is that we've arrived at a \"well you're just as bad!\" argument which doesn't accomplish anything, and if you are invested in the future of crypto you actually SHOULD be critical of its environmental impact in order to force innovation. The system we have is far from perfect but that doesn't mean we should destroy it entirely, the core idea of crypto currency is a very good one it just needs (a lot of) work on the execution.",

It was always a bit of a dull roar in the background, but now it seems like \"cryptocurrency\" has become synonymous with \"scam\" in the popular view. There's thread after thread of people raging about companies trying to make use of blockchains in various ways, and whenever I try to simply inject a little technical information (not even promoting anything in specific, just explaining \"this is how such-and-such works\") I get downvoted and excoriated as a scammer or a \"cryptobro.\"\n\nPeople enjoy righteous indignation. They love being part of a mob that's persecuting a deserving target. There's camaraderie, they're fighting the good fight, they're *heroes*. So if you try to point out \"hey, maybe you're wrong about some particular detail of what's justifying your rage\" you become the enemy. You're threatening to harshen their buzz.\n\nI mainly reassure myself by observing that this is a common, repeating pattern in human nature. Eventually the endorphins from repeated NFT-bashing will become stale. Eventually Ethereum will switch fully to PoS and the environmental boogeyman will lose his hold (sorry, Bitcoin). It's going to cost a lot of opportunities along the way, but if a blockchain application is truly advantageous then eventually someone will take advantage of it.

I also know that that a lot of rich individuals, companies (like MicroStrategy) and even countries (like El Salvador) it buying bitcoin, but still I see some risk factors that makes me question bitcoin's future:\n\n1. As we have some very big whales such as Max Kaiser which can probably move and manipulate the market for decades to come, why would even more countries and such move to bitcoin and risk being at the mercy of such individuals? \n2. Despite bitcoin's superb, unique qualities (ref the five pillars) which does solve some real problems for real people (especially in developed countries), why would we assume that Bitcoin will continue to be the crypto dominating this space, and not being replaced by another crypto for this segment of bitcoin users? I mean, bitcoin is great and all, but being the first (and as of now the biggest) in the market for say hedging against government induced hyperinflation, doesn't mean it will stay this way.\n3. If you subscribe to the notion that fiat money per definition is doomed due to inflation and government control, it's possible that bitcoin will remain an investing hedge by (wealthy) individuals and companies, and  not become the money of the future. If so, it's possible that bitcon remains just a regular investment asset along side stocks and so forth. \n\nI'll stop there, but I hope you see where I'm going with this. For me, there's a lot of ifs when it comes to the future of bitcoin, and a lot of resources I find online seems to totally ignore risks like the ones I mention above, so I though I'd reach out to the crypto community to get some input.",

            "text": "I first started investing in stocks during the weed stock surge back in 2017. Suffice to say, I lost a lot of money during that time as I invested a good chunk during all time highs. When it crashed, I had lost quite a bit of money. Luckily, I was still young and thought I had learnt from my mistakes and decided to carry on.\n\nFast forward to April 2021; I made back my losses and was finally making a profit. I thought to myself: why not start investing in crypto? So I invested $700 straight into ETH. But other than BTC and ETH I knew nothing about crypto and thought maybe I should figure this out. I downloaded and opened the Binance app and was instantly overwhelmed: where would I start? Shortly after a buddy of mine came to me and mentioned how he and some other guys were making a crap ton of money investing in something called Safemoon. I was immediately convinced and had $1,000 ready to invest. \n\nThen came the instructions\u2026 \n\nMy goodness what a process. What the hell is a pancake swap? Poocoin? Is that for real? Many moons later I figured it out. Nothing can compare to the stress of transferring your crypto from one exchange to another without knowing if it will actually go through. But it did, and all was well. I invested that $1,000 into Safemoon and thought \u201cokay I\u2019ll see where I\u2019m at next week\u201d. Well I looked the next day and my wallet was up a couple hundred bucks. Was crypto really that easy? I don\u2019t care, I was up. I decided to wait it out and see what happens. \n\nFast forward a few months and I came across R/Cryptocurrency. Oh hey, maybe I can talk about Safemoon and learn about other stuff here. Little did I know was I invested in what was known as the Darth Vader of crypto, the dark side, probably the worst possible investment I could possibly make. So I listened and cashed out my $1,500 (more or less) of Safemoon and decided to start off fresh. I thought that more research in this BSC space was necessary since it seemed to be a popular up and coming place with lots of room to grow - it was also a place that everyone in R/Cryptocurrency told me not to go. \n\nThe next place I decided to put my money in was a relatively new BSC token that paid BUSD rewards. Why the hell not? So I went and put in $1,500 into EGC, yet another token that the R/Cryptocurrency absolutely LOVES. \n\nWell let me tell you something, that $1,500 investment made me $6,000 faster than almost any investment I\u2019ve ever done in my life. This BSC stuff is for real. So I dug deeper in my research. \n\nWhat I had learnt was that most BSC  investments aren\u2019t going to take you anywhere. Many CAN earn you a profit only if you know WHEN to sell. One wrong move can spell the end of your investment. Therefore one strategy I had followed was to do as much research as I could on a specific project that interests me. If I felt that project was legit, I\u2019ll throw some cash into it (ideally before launch on pinksale). Upon launch, I\u2019d wait for the quick 2-3x and sell my initial investment. Simple as that! Now be forewarned that doesn\u2019t always work. There will always be those that don\u2019t shoot up, there are those that drop on launch and then there are those that are rug pulled. I have had all situations happen to me, but luckily, I have made at least 2x gains more often than not because (I believe) of the research I do beforehand. \n\nNow about these tokens I invest in; let\u2019s be honest, Most are a copy cat of the one I invested into previously. The code is the same, the rewards are the same, utilities may be similar. So what\u2019s the deal? The truth, to me at least, is that this is a new game and everyone wants a piece of the pie. Everyone wants to be the best and brightest newcomer with something new to offer. Safemoon did that, then EGC did that with the BUSD rewards and now others are following along all with a tweaked approach. \n\nNot to say this is bad. How can it be bad if I\u2019m making money? The truth is that there are some teams out there with an amazing background with some great devs working behind the scenes. Two that come to my head are RematicEGC and Y-5 Finance; both teams are run by outstanding individuals with a great core team around them and amazing communities. They are two of the main reasons why I decided to put this piece together. This does not ignore the fact that many and most projects don\u2019t have the leadership or flat out ability to move forward and will probably fail miserably. We\u2019re going to see a lot of that; Probably 95% of these tokens will cease to exist in the near future. And you know what? That doesn\u2019t phase me one bit because I\u2019m in the business of making money. And tokens like RematicEGC and Y-5 are helping me do just that.\n\nFine, most people here want a stable investment; but who doesn\u2019t? That\u2019s theoretically impossible. You never know what the almighty Bitcoin and etherium have in store for us tomorrow. There are so many people in this world that have lost millions in those two coins alone over the past few months. And yeah, you\u2019re going to respond to me by saying \u201cyeah, f*ck Bitcoin I\u2019m in sol\u201d, or mana or whatever the hell else you decide is a \u201csafe\u201d investment. \n\nBut let\u2019s be real, no investment in crypto is safe. Some ARE safer than others but that\u2019s when you have to look at risk vs reward. \n\nNow looking at the tokens that get shit on by this entire sub: the Safemoon, the egc\u2019s, etc. There\u2019s been some shady stuff going around about them but you know what? We probably know more about these guys than we do Bitcoin. For all we know; Bitcoin can just be one giant rug waiting to be pulled however since it\u2019s adopted by the masses we refrain from thinking that for btc as much as we would for Safemoon. \n\nAll in all, I\u2019m not going to give numbers, but these BSC investments got me thinking differently about how I am going to invest my money going forward because I\u2019ve probably made more in the last 6 months than I have the last 6 years on the stock market. Will this last forever? Probably not. But I can\u2019t get greedy. I have to continue to follow my plan to a T to ensure I don\u2019t get carried away and not take in profits. But until then, I\u2019ll keep trucking along making money I didn\u2019t think possible with the likes of Y5, Rematic, EGC and Safemoon while many continue to keep calling them scams and rug pulls. \n\nAll fine by me.",

He bags on ADA heaps, but he seems to be one of the most experienced lads within' the gaming blockchain hemisphere.\n\nJRNY Crypto - Another good addition, he releases vids every so often, but he's often been praised as having an absolute \"foot\" on the market at all times.\n\nCryptolution - I just really like his stuff, he's quite factual and it's easy to drift off into his info.\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\nBenjamin Cowen - A lot of people like his cointent, I like how he's straight up with his info, but I just get bored watching his stuff.\n\nBlockchain Backer - Not really familiar with his works, but apparently he called the 69k top. At least that's what I heard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease let me know your favs!",

            "text": "We have all come across news articles that discuss people who made insane gains in the crypto market like the [trader who turned $17 into \\~6MM](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/05/21076574/he-invested-17-in-shiba-inu-now-he-has-almost-6m) or [Dogecoin millionaires](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/millennial-dogecoin-millionaire-on-being-paid-in-dogecoin.html) who invested a considerable amount right at the beginning of the rally.\n\nBut the problem with these strategies is that it\u2019s heavily based on luck and for every winner, there would be hundreds of folks who lost all of their investment \\[1\\]. While it\u2019s great to be that guy who made a 1,00,000% gain in an investment, the realistic chances of that happening is slim to none.\n\nSo in my first-ever analysis covering the crypto market, we are diving deep into the data to create a strategy that will give us consistent returns year over year while trying to minimize the downside.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/y3cst78ujev71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8f5425b5a42e600175aff47a898c2e2284fc509)\n\n**Data**\n\nThere were a number of sources available for cryptocurrency data, but many of these sources had issues - They were either expensive, incomplete, or required separate signups. After extensive testing, I decided on a single source that solved many of these issues.\n\nThe data for this analysis was extracted using the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/) which had aggregated historical data across 317 different exchanges related to price, market capital, and the trading volume for thousands of cryptocurrencies. In most cases, the data was available even up to the time that the cryptocurrencies were initially listed!\n\nAll the data used in the analysis is shared as a Google sheet at the end.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qniqxw8ujev71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7bb4969861b84e417c610cc15ffbe5a5d6a3c5e\n\n **Results** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8y8gcquvjev71.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bb010e71d29bf03d38e1c52d010f38946f95b76\n\nDaily price and volume data for 1,985 cryptos were collected with data going back up to 2013 for some currencies. If you compare the first listing price on the exchange and the latest available price, only 40% of them have gained in value. \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/obl3mkywjev71.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaf4eced237bcf1164d501a1a0e724d2226e0f2f)\n\nEven though you have slightly less than a coin toss probability of picking a winner, the average gain across the currencies was a whopping 3048%! What is more interesting is the impact of outliers. If you just remove the top 1% of the currencies, the returns drop down to 641% and if you remove top 5% of the currencies, your return would only be slightly higher than the S&P500!\n\nNow the challenge becomes a question of how to make sure that you are consistently picking the top currencies that will gain in value over time. While you can try your luck at picking something that will end up in the top 1% and then get featured in the news for insane gains, the chances that you will pull it off are very low.\n\nWhat I have tried to create is a Dollar Cost Averaging strategy for the Crypto market based on the popularity/trading volume of the Currency. Before we jump into the exact strategy, here is a visualization of how the Crypto market has changed over the years.\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/n705232yjev71.gif)\n\n*In case the visualization is not loading in Reddit,* [*check it out here*](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7551046/)*.*\n\nAs you can see there has been a lot of turnover over the years with a few currencies maintaining their top 10 positions.\n\nThe strategy I have created is simple. On the 1st of every month, you check what the top-10 \\[2\\] traded currencies of the last month were and invest in them. For example, if I am investing $100 on 1st Nov 2021, I will check what were the most traded (i.e popular) cryptos in the past month (in this case Oct'21) and then invest in that. By following this strategy, you are not jumping into any investment. You are just methodologically checking the popular cryptos at the beginning of the month and investing in them.\u00a0\n\nThe underlying principle was to create a straightforward strategy that can be followed by anyone without luck coming into the factor.\u00a0Now there would be two ways to invest in the top 10 currencies. You can either split your investment equally across the cryptocurrencies or split it in the proportion to the traded volume.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/rtq4qzwyjev71.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bae1c0070e8bd22e92b56adf79db5bf151ef649)\n\nBoth strategies give amazing returns but equally splitting your investment produces almost double the weighted average split. This is mainly due to these reasons:\n\n* As we saw from the trading volume chart, the volume is ***extremely skewed*** towards Bitcoin. So if you do the weighted average split, most of your investment will go into Bitcoin and your returns would be pegged majorly to Bitcoin.\n* By doing an equal split, you are taking on much higher risk (as you are investing in relatively smaller cryptos) and you are being rewarded for the extra risk you took. \\[3\\]\n\nBut now you would be wondering whether this is applicable only for those who started in 2014. Sure, they would have made money in the crypto market.\n\nWhat if I had started late? Would my returns be significant enough to follow this strategy?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u37fsqtzjev71.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&s=49b6f4b0e564d0b131bfad7292a5215006603ddf\n\n This chart should put all the apprehensions to rest. No matter which year we had started, by following the DCA strategy, we would have made a significant return on our investment \\[4\\].  \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/qgpsou8ujev71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=526247a7e81ec0c0a024415f5b8b1bcda76ea451)\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThis analysis comes with its own limitations.\n\n* We are relying on the data produced by one company (CoinGecko). While they track more than 300 exchanges, we might have missed out on some other popular cryptos that were not traded in the exchanges tracked by CoinGecko\n* There are [more than 2200 dead coins](https://www.coinopsy.com/dead-coins/#other) \\- but the majority of them were not listed on any big exchange (due to which we won't have data) and if particular crypto became popular (like top 100 in trading volume) at any time, the chances of them dying out completely is very low. (In the 2,000 cryptos we have data for, from 2013, only 3% became inactive completely)\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/2ahwmm9ujev71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b6c7af8c8bdb2ce729690fbb9b856b11c2623b)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile there are [index funds/tokenized ETF\u2019](https://www.bitwiseinvestments.com/funds/Bitwise-10)s available for Cryptos, they usually charge an exorbitant expense ratio (Bitwise Index fund charges a whopping 2.5% \\[5\\]) and have not been around for long enough to reliably trust them with your funds.\n\nIt certainly is alluring to be that guy who can now retire after [making a $17 investment](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/05/21076574/he-invested-17-in-shiba-inu-now-he-has-almost-6m) in the right cryptocurrency. But then again, you have similar chances of winning the lottery.\n\nCertainly, you can invest in one currency if you completely believe in its long-term prospects and viability. For the rest of us who might not have the time and capabilities to research and invest in individual cryptocurrencies, I guess the 10,000%+ return on your invested amount is plenty good enough!  \n\nPrice, Volume, and Market cap data collected for all Cryptos: [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11jtsghd_XcxIZgOFDUFkGYAe1vzvwXSz/view?usp=sharing) (It\u2019s around 100MB in size and has \\~1.2MM rows)\n\nAnalysis Sheet: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mILuQILazut6ejI2zROTV_zW9Bngl0TOagzvAamQlus/edit?usp=sharing) \n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] As we found later in the analysis, approximately 60% of the listed currency lost value over the tracking period.\n\n\\[2\\] I took top-10 as it felt like a realistic number of cryptos to keep track of. The results would be different if you choose the top 100 or top 5. If you are planning on following this strategy, please optimize the number of cryptos based on your risk profile and the time you can invest in this exercise.\n\n\\[3\\] Do note that extra returns are not always guaranteed just because you are taking a higher risk. There is a concept of Beta in stock markets. Beta measures the volatility of stocks. Investing in stocks having higher volatility (say +3 or +4) will net you higher returns when the market is going up but if the market turns, your losses also will be proportionally higher when compared to stable stocks.\n\n\\[4\\] Even if you had started your investment at the peak of the 2016-17 rally, you would have made a 629% return to date.\n\n\\[5\\] The below chart from Vanguard shows the impact of 2% fees over a 25 year period for a $100K investment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qnhxx4r3kev71.png?width=286&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a69c1aee941799113f09991e0593cf23a7aaaf1\n\n  *Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.

I think this can be helpful to a lot of people that don't know where to start.\n\nI have one limitation that comes to mind when you talk about removing the top 1% and seeing how the % gains drops. The issue with that is that there are many young projects that are very promising and will gain in %. So there is a bias towards older projects. Try looking at a shorter timeframe like from the last BTC halving to now and you should see another picture emerge. This is the difficult part of data analysis. Depending on what you look at you can come to different conclusions.\n\n\nI do like that you mention the Beta concept because that is something a lot of people don't understand. Volatility is great to have fast gains but if you don't play your cards right then you lose a lot in the end.",

Attacking banks because they are _also_ used to launder money is just [a tu quoque fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque).\n\nTo attack this argument, you either need to go at it directly, and point out things like due to the public nature of the blockchain, it's actually _easier_ to trace funds on a cryptocurrency like bitcoin than a traditional bank, where you need to work with private companies in potentially a large number of jurisdictions, some of whom won't want to work with you.\n\nIf you're a fan of privacy tokens, then you just need to acknowledge that money laundering will be a thing, but point out that personal privacy might be a larger concern, and illegal use might just be a necessary evil, like it is with cash.",

On the one hand I think \"haha let em get rekt\" but on the other I just hate to see our precious space go to the proverbial dogs and have to listen to every Tom Dick and Harry on their opinions about coins. One of my friend last night (who has never been involved with crypto before) asked me if I was in on a coin called CUMMIES, I looked it up, its literally called CumRocket (CUMMIES) and this dude was taking it seriously, I just wanted to curl up in a ball and dissolve away so I don't have to deal with everyone's nonsense, especially as I just know everyone I know will start bugging me when the true mania kicks in soon.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to vent. I'm sure there's a bunch of Bitcoin OG's out there that feel the same, ironically I only started using reddit relatively recently and was enjoying it but now it has just changed to something like a constant WSB thread but without as much lightheartedness.",

And BTC/ETH obviously. Most everything else is just noise, at least for now. Dabble in the shitcoins if you\u2019re looking for a gamble, not a bad way to up your stack if you\u2019re smart about it. But I guarantee if you focus on those categories and buy when things are cheap over the next couple years, you\u2019ll be one happy camper come 2023-24. And pay attention to what doesn\u2019t die in the upcoming bear market, whatever shows resilience is probably worth noting. \n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve learned that crypto is one of those things that nobody can really \u201cteach\u201d you about in terms of investing, you just eventually get a sense for it. Sometimes I go back and look at how well the very first things I bought have performed compared to what I\u2019ve bought just in the last 6m-1y and it\u2019s crazy the difference. And this is how I\u2019ve arrived at the 3 categories I mentioned above, by far the best performers and they will only grow bigger with time. \n\nIf you want me to drop some names of projects I\u2019m watching for the long-term, just let me know. I don\u2019t wanna just throw them out there and look like I\u2019m trying to shill anything. Cheers!",

                            "response": "Sorry I'm just now replying, been pretty busy! I've narrowed down the list as there's just so many out there but it's still fairly lengthy. No way you could get any meaningful amount in all of these so you'll have to DYOR and figure which you like the most, but they are all promising projects. All tokens are listed from greatest to least market cap, so projects toward the bottom of each list are where you could likely see the biggest returns. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll start with the DeFi projects (including a few derivatives/options projects):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Aave (AAVE)\n\n\\- Maker (MKR)\n\n\\- Compound (COMP)\n\n\\- Synthetix (SNX)\n\n\\- Yearn Finance (YFI)\n\n\\- Alpha Finance (ALPHA)\n\n\\- Injective Protocol (INJ)\n\n\\- Gnosis (GNO)\n\n\\- Perpetual Protocol (PERP)\n\n\\- Akropolis (AKRO)\n\n\\- HEGIC (HEGIC)\n\n\\- Liquity Protocol (LQTY)\n\n\\- Opium (OPIUM)\n\n\\- PoolTogether (POOL)\n\n\\- dHedge DAO (DHT)\n\n\\- IDLE Finance (IDLE)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince there's so many DeFi projects out there, I absolutely recommend Index Cooperative's DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) which will give you exposure to AAVE, MKR, COMP, SNX, and YFI all in one token. DPI is one of my biggest holdings. Plus they're constantly improving it, including a recent governance proposal to add \"Intrinsic Productivity\" to it (you'll have to go to their site if you want to read up more on that) so the token actually generates some extra returns for holders beyond just price action of the tokens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow for the Oracle Network and Web3 projects (kinda go hand in hand, also a few more general \"infrastructure\" related projects as well):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Chainlink (LINK)\n\n\\- Filecoin (FIL)\n\n\\- Basic Attention Token (BAT)\n\n\\- Skynet/Siacoin (SC)\n\n\\- The Graph (GRT)\n\n\\- NEAR Protocol (NEAR)\n\n\\- ANKR (ANKR)\n\n\\- Arweave (AR)\n\n\\- Ocean Protocol (OCEAN)\n\n\\- Band Protocol (BAND)\n\n\\- Golem Network (GLM)\n\n\\- Tellor (TRB)\n\n\\- Mask Network (MASK)\n\n\\- API3 (API3)\n\n\\- Litentry (LIT)\n\n\\- Big Data Protocol (BDP)\n\n\\- Opacity (OPCT)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpecial mentions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Metaverse Index (MVI) - if you think the \"Metaverse\" will be big someday (I think there's a decent shot it will be). Though this one is definitely a long-term hold, at least a few years.\n\n\\- Index Cooperative (INDEX) - makers of DPI and MVI, among others. Personally I think the Index market will be huge for onboarding new people to crypto that don't want to deal with the haystack of tokens out there. Very fair value on this one as well. Amazing Index tokens!\n\n\\- PieDAO (DOUGH) - another Index project, and very low MC. Probably very little downside on this one. They also make some DeFi index tokens, though I prefer the greater variety of the DeFi Pulse Index. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, this list is pretty narrowed down. There are so many promising projects out there but as I said in my first comment, the DeFi, Oracle Network, and Web3 sectors are very likely going to be the biggest winners in my opinion. Hopefully these lists gave you some direction in your search, there's tons of information out there if you ever want to learn more. Good luck!",

I see doge as viable because of its visibility and low cost, it\u2019s biggest con is the whales. The average joe will never own one btc and that is a turn off to most. Will it hit $1000? Most likely not, but all of the hate it is receiving recently has  given me 1000x more confidence in it hitting $1 because this is all the same fud I was hearing when btc roared towards $100/$1000/$10000. The crypto market imploded until this last year or two why? Because institutions finally bought in, they realized it wasn\u2019t going anywhere no matter what they did. I believe this is where doge is currently, will there be a retraction? Absolutely, but if the whales are kept at bay and the community keeps it alive the sky is the limit.",

Should BTC be labeled as something that \"cannot be stopped/changed\" or its emissions labeled \"not that bad?\"\n\nThis is part of the reason why CTOs and devs are building a more sustainable cryptocurrency/algorithm/blockchain (ie.

Especially since Bitcoins current energy is not a representation of the exponentially higher energy usage that would be needed for it to become a 10 trillion or more.\n\nIf time indicates that another chain can remain secure while using exponentially less energy it will eventually take over. Especially if it is more programmable and integrates into the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nBitcoin maxis are not winning the philosophical debate. They share the desire for a store of value and that is the only thing sustaining Bitcoin into the mainstream world. Chains like Cardano that maintain the store of value tokenomics for their main currency are making a strong play against Bitcoin. A store of value currency with decentralized interest (staking, defi, etc) is far superior to Bitcoin.\n\n**But I wouldn't count Bitcoin dead just yet.** I think all of these points are valid for a slightly more distant future and the current FUD is just making everyone feel like it's here.

He said Tesla would not be selling any of its Bitcoin. Keynote he never said they would not be buying anymore. My speculation. This is to get people to sell their Bitcoin.

Both companies know that Tether makes the market seem a lot more liquid then it really is.\n\nBetween the two companies at current prices they would eat 25% of all combined buy orders, but those are orders for all crypto. So for the Bitcoin pair a 5 billion sell of would totally eat most order books.  And selling 5 billion dollars worth of BTC OCT is not an easy thing either, plus if they dump on the market they might be able to buy back for a lot less later after causing a lot of panic.\n\nIf you think Elon and Saylor are above that ... think again.",

Further, the block size solution that helps BCH become cheaper to transact also results in a massive increase in chain size were it to gain adoption to the scale BTC has (and even worse if it were to gain world wide mainstream adoption).\n\nI don\u2019t believe anyone has truly solved all the fundamental issues involved with doing micro transactions sustainably into the long term future. Until we can truncate/remove old transactions somehow, no PoW or PoS blockchain can escape the memory scaling issues.\n\nSharded systems like Harmony look promising, mainly because they present the possibility of moving liquidity off of a shard and deprecating it (thus removing that old data from the network). But even they aren\u2019t actually doing this. They\u2019re still focused on sharding as a way to keep the transaction fees super low.

            "text": "I reviewed the the whitepapers for the top 20 cryptoassets by market cap based on their practical value for non-researchers\n\n**TL;DR**:\n\nDifferent WPs have different motives and agendas. Some are highly-technical research papers. Some are marketing brochures. Some are blatantly false (\\*cough\\* USDT). Most WPs are outdated.\n\nWhitepapers are usually good for answering the question of why the cryptoasset was created. However, they typically aren't the best sources of info. For example, nearly all of these cryptoasset foundations have excellent documentation and knowledgebase sites that are kept updated. **Most users should not bother learning from outdated whitepapers when there's a better documentation site.**\n\n**Disclaimer**: There is almost no correlation between the usefulness of a whitepaper (specifically for the typical investor) to how well-designed the cryptoasset is.\n\n--------------------\n\nEvery once awhile, I come across posts or comments suggesting that whitepapers are excellent sources of knowledge about specific cryptoassets. And you get plenty of comments in these posts praising OP's literacy or research despite that the commenters clearly did not bother reading the mentioned WPs. People who claim that Satoshi's whitepaper is a great source of Bitcoin info is an obvious giveaway that they haven't actually studied it, because they should've realized that it's really about the Proof of Work consensus mechanism and only covers a quarter of the features of Bitcoin.\n\nHere's the actual value you'll get out of reading the whitepaper.\n\n**Educational value**: The rating criteria is entirely based on how much a non-technical university student would learn about the cryptoasset from reading the whitepaper for 30 minutes. Many here don't have the attention span for 1 minute, so I don't think they would have the patience to read 50+ pages of a research paper. Many of these are quite useful for crypto researchers but completely useless for the typical crypto investor.\n\n**Length**: Estimated pages excluding appendixes, references, and non-related info\n\n**Date**: Date of the latest revision of the whitepaper\n\n|Cryptoasset|Educational value|Length (pages)|Date|Short review|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|BTC|C or B+|8|2008|Aka \"A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\". The name is a misnomer. **It's actually a WP for the Proof of Work** consensus and barely covers most others aspects of Bitcoin itself. **If it were the \"PoW WP\", I'd give it a B+**. Its is in its reason for why PoW and Bitcoin were developed. As for the rest of it, it's a bit technical for most readers. And for those of us who are technical, we can spot its flaws. It's slightly outdated on its methodology and underestimates probabilities for 51% attacks, which are now done using withholding attacks. It's also debateable whether Bitcoin is still following Satoshi's original vision.|\n|ETH|A- (current), D (original)|40|LIVE|Ethereum does have an original WP, but its current form is more like a live Wiki page for Ethereum that's kept updated. This is a bit long, but it covers everything: History of Bitcoin, Ethereum, mining, gas, PoW, scripting, smart contracts, UXTO vs Account transactions, tokenomics. Regardless of whether it counts as a WP, it's excellent info.|\n|BNB|D|7|Unknown|This isn't a BNB WP. This is a marketing pitch for Binance and only offers brief tokenomics details on BNB. It spends more time talking about the exchange and the Binance team than about the BNB coin.|\n|ADA|C-|42|2017|This is an excellent example of why you shouldn't be getting information from an outdated WP. Instead, you should use the large Cardano Docs website for information. This obviously outdated 2017 paper starts off similar to the ETH WP in discussing its reason d'etre and history. But it eventually dissolves into business and project management jargon. It's a discussion of the Cardano **background** and foundation instead of info about the design of ADA itself. I feel like this was written for business and legal professionals.|\n|USDT|F|15|2016|The Tether WP says it's backed in a one-to-one ratio with the equivalent amount of fiat currency held in reserve. They have admitted that's not true in their attestations and audits this year. The Omni protocol mentioned in the WP is no longer accurate, and possibly never was. We already know much of it is false. For example: \"Tether has a simple and reliable Proof of Reserves implementation and undergoes regular professional audits.\" Grade: F for False|\n|XRP|B|8|2018|Ripple properly mentions that this document is outdated with a red banner at the top. Nevertheless, it's accurate on its short analysis of BFT and centralized design.|\n|SOL|C|31|2018|Now this is a detailed **research paper** on the consensus mechanism of Solana. It has a lot of good info, but it leaves out some important aspects like the high hardware requirements for nodes. It's also too technical for 99% of the community to bother reading.|\n|DOT|A|19, 15|2018, 2020|Polkadot has a WP and a \"Lightpaper\". I wonder if a Biochemist drew the diagrams in the WP, because they totally look like biochemistry diagrams. This is both very technical but also easy to read. I love it. In addition, they have an excellent \"Lightpaper\" for the non-technical. Win-win!|\n|USDC|A-|22||This tells you everything you need to know about CENTRE, USDC, network design, and team. The only thing that's missing is the design for its reserve.|\n|DOGE|F|5|n/a|I couldn't find the original DOGE WP. It's currently just a github page that links to its official subreddit for more information. It doesn't mention anything about its network or consensus algorithm.|\n|LUNA|C|15|2019|A bit short and quite technical. Just use their documentation.|\n|WBTC|A-|14|2019|Surprisingly easy to read. This is actually end-user documentation that's disguided as a mock research paper. I'll let that count.|\n|AVAX|A (Platform), D (others)|60|LIVE|There are 4 separate Avalanche WPs written between 2019 and 2020 that serve difference purposes. Well-written and not yet outdated. Aside from the Platform one, they're all quite long and technical.|\n|BUSD|D|7|Unknown|Uses the same WP as for BNB|\n|LTC|C|4|2011|This is surprisingly concise because everything mentioned is a comparison to Bitcoin. It indirectly describes each part of its design as a comparison to other cryptoassets. So if you don't know already know about the other coins' designs, this WP won't be particularly helpful.|\n|LINK|D|136|2021|I admit I have not studied their updated 2.0 WP in detail. I'm sure it's an excellent paper and documentation, and it's only moderately technical. However, it's a GIGANTIC 136 pages long. There is no way you can cover this paper in 30 minutes.|\n|BCH|n/a or B|8|2008|BCH actually shares the same whitepaper as Bitcoin. It was designed as a \"Peer-to-Peer\" electronic cash system in Nakamoto's original vision when its supporters no longer believed that Bitcoin was following the original plan.\n|ALGO|F|180+|2017-2019|5 different technical WPs from 2017 to 2019 covering 180+ pages total. The original one is a whopping 72 pages long. You're going to want to use their documentation, not their WP.|\n|SHIB|A+|22|2021|The biggest joke is that the the biggest joke coin actually has the **best** whitepaper. It covers so much: Purpose, design, history, tokenomics, staking, incentives, pools, liquidity, future discussion in a well-organized and easy-to-read document that even layman can understand.\u200b Quite surprised they spent the effort for a joke coin.|\n\nEdit: For those of you wondering why I rated SHIB so highly, you should re-read the grading rubric. It's not a grade of how well the WP is written for pure researchers, but for a specific target audience.\n\nIt's a rhetorical reply to the nonsense claim that \"the best way to learn about a coin is to first read its whitepaper\". In most cases, even crypto researchers should be using the project documentation site instead of the WP.",

Ideas like crypto compatible credit cards. I made one not too long ago and they\u2019re actually super helpful and convenient. They\u2019re also pretty easy to get. I made mine through Bitcoin Vault but there are plenty of other wallets doing those too. What I like the most about mine is that I get crypto cash back. It\u2019s a transitional way of payment that in my opinion will definitely help the populous adopt crypto much faster.",

            "text": "If you don't know what it is and how it works pi is a really popular, kinda new 'crypto currency' which is really easy to 'mine' with your phone, and here is a quick recap of what a pi user does: \n\n1. Download the pi network app on their phone(or pc)\n2. Open the app once every day and click the button to start 'mining' pi\n3. Acumulate pi coins\n\nThey even have a subreddit called pinetwork\n\nIt seems super easy and the developers are promising that pi is going to change crypto space forever by making it more accessible and easy to use, and saying how it is the next bitcoin but better and that it's better than other crypto currencies since you can mine it without an expensive computer, all you need is a phone.\n\nThe developers use a lot of buzz words that are used in crypto space like 'mining' , 'halving' and 'crypto wallets' and what not and people who don't know much about crypto currencies are easily falling for it.\n\nHowever, there are a bunch of issues with this 'crypto currency':\n\n1. It isn't actually a cryptocurrency\n2. Mining pi isn't actually mining anything\n3. Pi doesn't have a value and the supply is 'unknown'(unlimited)\n4. It is centralized\n5. It will eventually defeat it's purpose\n\nPi isn't a crypto as they say it is, it isn't decentralized and you can't mine it. The whole 'pi network' is on the copmany's servers. The app has a button that says 'click to mine pi' and by clicking it, pi coins start flooding your 'wallet'. It has nothing to do with mining since you are not providing hash power or liquidity. Basically what's happening is that on their servers, developers are just adding some credits to your account, the same way a video game copany adds virtual money to your online game account. \n\nAnother issue is that pi doesn't have a value. It's worthless. Developers are open about it, since of course they can't hide it, but they are constantly promising that when they 'transition to a blockchain' pi will become valuable. There are millions of users with thousands of pi coins on their accounts and the supply is 'unknown' but right now, it is basically infinite meaning that pi is trully worthless.\n\nThat transition is what I think it's the worst part about this. Basically since pi coin right now isn't a crypto currency, it's just like a score in an online video game, if the developers want to make it a decetralized crypto currency, they are gonna have to develop a new crypto coin, call it pi coin, generate millions of wallets and give them out to users, delete the current pi coins they have and send the exact ammount of PRE-MINED new pi coins to their wallets.\n\nNot only is that going to be extremely complicated to do, but it is also going to mean that pi coin will be almost worthless and it will become impossible to mine it with one click a day(which will defeat it's purpose) because that's not how gas fees work.\n\nDevs are curently runing some 'tests' on their testnet but that's a pointless waste of time since even if they manage to make pi a propper crypto currency, it's gonna be worthless. The only good thing about pi is that you aren't going to lose anything by participating.",

I know like many of you I am skeptical and when things don\u2019t seem to smell right I ask myself \u201cWho benefits?\u201d and in this case it\u2019s clearly not the consumer. The SEC is charged with protecting retail investors which would make the most plausible kind of ETF to be approved a spot ETF however, the futures ETF was the one that was approved and there are now multiple. The thing about futures ETFs is they don\u2019t end up affecting the underlying assets price much and don\u2019t track the price of bitcoin very closely which causes a disconnect. One can\u2019t help, but realize that by doing this the powers that be are trying to keep the status quo by attempting to put the genie back in the bottle and disrupt bitcoins price discovery. \n\nWHY THIS MATTERS \n\nBitcoin is arguably the gateway drug to crypto. I for one got into crypto in 2017 because I heard about bitcoin hitting 10k, but went into altcoins. The bottom line is bitcoin is the poster child for the crypto space and the better it does (at least for now) the more people and institutions come into the space, which is something that is good for all of us for many reasons. I won\u2019t pretend to really understand what's going on at the technical level with spot and futures ETFs. I\u2019m just some millennial PE teacher who in my free time hops around discord servers, lurks on various subreddits and listens to a lot of crypto podcasts. Both Mark Yusko and Plan B who obviously are legends have hinted themselves that there could be foul play here with the SECs decision to embrace futures ETFs. I was inspired by /r WallStreetBets a year ago and it feels like this moment could be the spiritual successor of last year's ape fest. Let's break the glass ceiling, the lid they tried to put on bitcoin. Bitcoin is and represents money for the people, the ability to redistribute wealth, and create a more equitable and censorship resistant future. I am lucky to live in the U.S, a country with its own problems as every other country has theirs. However, one thing I think we can all agree on is that the world isn\u2019t perfect, infact far from it, but there is a step we can take to make it much better for us all. If we all banded together and bought up BTC we could move the price by magnitudes, trigger institutional FOMO (who need to reach certain market caps to invest), blow past silver\u2019s MC perhaps or even get within striking distance of gold\u2019s and tell some powerful people you\u2019ve lost now GTFO. \n\n\n\nNot expecting much out of this, but I at least wanted to try since I\u2019m just getting so fucking fed (pun not intened) up with corruption and want to see something change the world for the better when it so clearly can.\n\n[Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)",

The point of this post is to show how quickly things progress both inside and outside the crypto space. We are still relatively early adopters. We should support one another, regardless of the project you've invested in unless it's a poop coin, in which case, be humble enough to listen to the counsel of others. \n\n\nEdit: thanks for the reward, kind stranger! \nStay blessed and HODL!",

Imagine if the g7 banned bitcoin trading. The value would tank overnight. So, you'd have to weight the risk of losing a huge amount of value, against the risk of having tokenised assets seized. \n\nI feel like a broad portfolio of international assets makes more sense, since you can bring the risk of seizure close to zero, but dont risk arbitrary crashes in the asset values, as they are based on material things, and not just pure sentiment. \n\nAlso, the gold analogy is poor, since gold doesn't historically trade significantly above extraction costs, outside of a few short term bubbles. Gold is mostly trading at cost. The anology to that might be the cost to mine a bitcoin, but it's not very strong since bitcoin is fundamentally fungible with any fork, outside of sentiment.",

Yes, the richest people and groups in the world can influence. In time they may even control it.\n\nBut right now, other than Ethereum which is doing great things, what other cryptocurrency is doing *anything* functional enough to be a danger for Bitcoin? Lots of promises. The same sort of promised I've been hearing for years. I'm talking actually being used by some meaningful level of society. Bitcoin is already mainstream but the alts (other than eth) are still highly centralized and not doing anything with the level of decentralization that Bitcoin is. I'm not a \"maximalist\" but I've personally listened closely to the promises made by many alts, invested in many, all are nowhere meaningfully different than they were 3 years ago. Please prove me wrong, I'd love to see crypto evolve since I believe in the space.",

Banks will start trading desks and store your bitcoin for you. \n\nDefi and ethereum on the other hand directly threaten a banks business. It allows transfer of money without the banks involvement.

There's a reason why \"market confidence\" has such an impact on the value of currency. Even gold has no 'intrinsic value' unless you're talking rarity and if we're going that route then there's rarer things than gold that are worth less. \n\nIn this case, yes he's right bitcoin people could lose their money, but if people keep wanting to buy it then.... Andy... buddy.... what happens when people keep wanting to buy a finite resource? Of course, Andy would definitely say that past performance is not an indicator of future performance - and therefore bitcoin isn't guaranteed to stay in demand. Andy will at the same time be basing all his other economic models on past performance actually being the best modeller of future performance. \n\nI haven't studied economics but I'm pretty sure he's technically correct but would not like it if we point that technically correct torchlight too closely at his own banking system.

They mention at the end of the article that the bank is working on its own cryptocurrency, so this reads as FUD in a misguided attempt to create a doubt vacuum to fill with their token. \n\nWhile they\u2019re still only gains on paper, my $810 invested in bitcoin alone is up more than 860% in 2.5 years. Even the worst performing sub-$1 coins I\u2019ve purchased are up %20 in a little over a month. The sub $1 stocks I\u2019ve purchased in the same timeframe are down ~15-25%. My 401k has grown 45% this year which is huge, but that\u2019s likely also a cause of the bull market that is pumping crypto prices, and I\u2019m expecting to see those 401k gains shrink when the bubble pops.\n\nThat\u2019s another benefit of crypto, I can pay a small fee to instantly convert my bitcoin into USDC, a crypto coin tethered to the dollar, or another crypto project to protect the gains. If I tried to do that with my 401k it would be a paperwork hassle, and take days to process. \n\nThe most valuable nugget of truth in that article is one that is true for all investments: don\u2019t invest money you aren\u2019t prepared to lose, because no investment is a guarantee.",

But lets be realistic, the dive would be so massive and fast that more than likely that 10 wouldn't trigger. \n\nWhich, incidentally is why (traditionally...not in this gambling market of the past couple of years), instead of setting a limit order you would purchase a put option to hedge your downside risk.",

If no one wants a bitcoin, the seller is forced to drop his price until someone is attracted by the bargain and becomes a buyer.\n\nIf the remaining 18,000,000 bitcoin are being holdled and not for sale, they form part of the equation indirectly, and the strength of conviction matters.  If there is a strong hodl instinct, prices need to go crazy to tempt people to change from being a hodler to being a buyer or seller.  If it's weak, prices don't need to change much to tempt them.  \n\nIf the market is made up largely of big holders, and it is, they can manipulate prices by over and under supplying. This is most effective when combined with market sentiment.  That is, if we are all euphoric and it's going to the moon, the whales tap into that sentiment and feed the run by not selling.  When they judge a natural top is reached, and prices are sky high because everyone wants bitcoin but few are selling, they start selling, at best profit.  They will monitor the effect that they (and the other whales) are benefitting from, aiming to continue to sell at profit and also oversupply to lower the prices further, until they are attractive to them to start buying at instead.\n\nIf paper hands fold and panic sell having bought in at the highest prices, those aware of what's going on in the market cycle can accumulate cheap coin, eventually everyone stops selling as the value is so low they may as well keep it, rather than get next to nothing back, this is the bottom and a new cycle starts again. \n\n Historical price moves matter, because they are areas of support or resistance.  If a lot of coin was bought at 30,000 then that's a price point that not many will sell at, as they've not made any money. 60,000 is likely to see people start to sell and take profits, so that's a resistance point.\n\nPatterns in this behaviour are visible in the charts, and this is where technical analysis comes in. We can see, roughly, what the whales are up to, and mimic their highly profitable actions to benefit at the same time.",

The reason for this is that most of the exchanges use Bitcoin as the reserve currency.\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency in existence. It is still the coin with the most recognition, highest adoption, highest market cap, and one of the highest daily volumes. This made it a natural choice to become the reserve currency as more and more altcoins entered the market. All altcoins exchange rates are being priced against Bitcoin.\n\nWhen you look at the price of an altcoin in USD, you are actually looking at the altcoin\u2019s price in relation to Bitcoin\u2019s exchange rate with USD. Every altcoin value must first be converted to Bitcoin equivalent value before it is converted to USD.\n\nWhen the Bitcoin price falls or rises against the USD, all the altcoins will usually follow. This is because all altcoin prices are based on their Bitcoin exchange rate, not their USD exchange rate.\"",

The price is just an agreement (obtained through supply and demand) of what everyone trading thinks is a fair price for the product being bought. If you set a sell order for bitcoin today for 65.000usd no one would think that's a fair price. However if you set it a few 100usd above the current price, and people are optimistic, someone might buy it for you at that price, thus making your price the 'new' price for bitcoin. As in: everyone else can see that your price is the most recent price bitcoin was traded for.   \n  \nI think you can compare it a bit to the housing market. You can buy or build a house and then live in it for 20 years. During these 20 years it's off the market. However, other people are buying and selling houses, moving the housing prices up or down. Even though maybe only about 5% of houses is on the market at any given time, the general agreement of what a house is worth keeps on changing. If you decide to sell your house after 20 years, people will be looking at the most recent prices houses were sold for, not the price you originally paid for it.",

All they've really done is restrict it to state-owned or state-backed organisations because they want mass adoption of the digital Yuan in China when it's released. Furthermore, their digital currency will be the next system by which they will inevitably monitor their country and the population within it thus inverting the very reason for the invention of cryptocurrency in the first place.\n\nDespite banning cryptocurrency, China will still have it's finger in that particular pie though the general population will not have access to it.",

I have been doing this for years now but on and off, I always wanted to make it known to all customers that this is possible with the right cryptocurrencies. At the moment I am accepting only NANO due to its speed and fees compared to other cryptos. I use NANO's official app and the customers who would like to pay in crypto know about it. For other currencies like BTC, ADA, ETH etc.. I will be using my wallets like Atomic, Trust and or exchanges like [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) & Coinbase. \n\nI have around 8 customers right now that pay only in crypto and hopefully there will be more. I charge \u00a315 for a haircut but if you pay in crypto I lower it to \u00a312. I have posters made for the shop so that when we re-open on 12th April all customers can see and hopefully start to look into investing and using crypto themselves. Bitcoin has changed my life, I bought my business and home because of it so I am always going to be a big fan.\n\nThank you for reading, any questions please feel free to ask.",

As always i advise to lock in profit when intraday trading bitcoin . My stop loss was set to 1K pips in profit so no problem with it turning. Now what\u2019s the next possible trade?

It looks like central banks are going to try to adopt it rather than attempt to ban it, which would be a nightmare for the entire planet. BTC was proof of concept, but there are endless other coins now that are better. I really don\u2019t see a future for it. ETH is in big trouble but it could pull it out if it can get to proof of stake fast enough (think electricity consumption) but it\u2019s a huge gamble. In the end, it\u2019s going to be ETH and/or a few other platforms that take off. ADA, DOT, ICP, and XRP are a few to keep an eye on, but it really depends on what central banks do. They are not, I repeat not, going to make deflationary coins. It moves wealth the wrong direction in their eyes and they have a decent argument for it. Fiat denominated debt has sustained the world since the 70s. Money is created from the promise of creating wealth, e.g., loaning money to build a house. Inflation is coupled with it to keep the purchasing power of the currency relatively stable. This mostly works, but it skews the transfer of wealth towards central banks, lending institutions, and their cronies in the financial industry. They will do whatever it takes to maintain this. \n\nI really need to study it more, but at my level of ignorance, I have a hard time seeing how defi products and deflationary coins can sustain an economy. Nobody would take out a 5 year loan on a deflationary product. You could borrow $10k and end up owing $10M (in purchasing power). Stable coins (that I\u2019m aware of) are tied to fiat, so other than lowering fees and transfer barriers (which is huge, but central banks could solve it with fiat if they wanted to) they really are useless because they don\u2019t have a way to inflate with the production of new wealth. Absent that solution, crypto doesn\u2019t have a long term future. They could be tied to a basket of assets and commodities, but that\u2019s massively subjective and changes rapidly over time. How much did people spend on electronics just 30 years ago? Medically unnecessary biotech is likely to be a huge portion of spending over the next few decades and there\u2019s virtually nothing being spent on it now. How would a decentralized coin stay stable in that environment without being tied to fiat?\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a wild ride, but there\u2019s a ton of money to be made if and when crypto resolves this. Watch for a stable coin not controlled by a central bank that can keep its purchasing power constant without subjective intervention. That will cause a revolution similar in scale to the renaissance (the banking revolution).",

This doesnt seem like 2017-2018 cause there is serious investors in here now, there are real companies doing real stuff but there are also a lot of scams, the space being so unregulated will keep bringing new tokens that dont do a thing. Dont expect a 2018 bear market honestly ever again, what we will see is 1. Dominance of BTC lower 2. The real king ETH as it should always have been come up as number one 3. A shiiiitt ton of dumb money come in get rekkt and never come back again 4. Shit ton of meme coins trying to be the next doge (we already have a couple see ShibaInu and Safemoon) 5. A looot of rugpulls. But this is good this will teach people to stay away from shitcoins, to do real research, to not fuck with tokens with no basis or fundamentals, the worst of it is that a reputable idiot is manipulating the market and just bringing hordes of dumb money in the space to get either rich or rekkt either way exposure to the market may make them change to a reputable project or just cashout their losses. My experience tells me when people get rekkt they normally wait forever and keep on holding until \"next\" time. But what do I know this is the most strangest moment in crypto but atleast there is adoption and people are paying attention ao I guess is positive?",

Both are near ATH's and I also DCA anyway. \n\nI have been given an unexpected $2000 work bonus that I didn't expect. My finances are otherwise locked up and well organised - I'm not one of the WSB guys. So I plan to use it as a true YOLO fund. Adding $2000 to my Eth account is highly unlikely to create \"lifechanging\" profits - even if it goes 10x. However I have never toyed with \"newer\" funds that have slim chances of 100-1000x growth. If I lose the money then so be it... I didn't expect to have it anyway. I don't want to split it into small sums in each as the potential for huge returns is minimised.\n\nSO...Would you go for Polygon, Shibu Inu or other? \n\n(obviously I'm doing my own DD, just interested and as it's less of a considered investment and more of a gamble, thought it would fun)",

That type of yolo?\n\nMy point is that polygon is a HUGE project with millions of users and billions in liquidity locked up. It\u2019s set up to be the go to solution for l2. I was buying in the .10 and all the way up to the now 1.00 mark. Market cap in consideration, you can expect a 1-5x so I treat it as a smart investment not so much of a yolo.\n\nIf you want to go yolo and say screw it I might become super wealthy, this is an honest opinion: look into the app called VEVE. It runs on a token called OMI. They are partnered with marvel, DC, the biggest licensed names in the history of the world. Pok\u00e9mon licensor is connected to the project. OMI has a big token unlock recently but it has a functional working app on the App Store and every one of their sales has sold out (hundreds of millions in sales) for their NFT. It\u2019s been insane to be a part of.\n\nSo if you want a real true blue YOLO, buy 2k worth of OMI. It will take 2 years before the tokens are used enough for the app to then have to start doing automatic buy backs from the open market to replenish their supply inside the app to keep the app running. But with the price at shiba lows... you could be a millionaire lol. Do your own research and look into OMI. It\u2019s public and easy to find online now.",

It was the most likely area of confluences for Bitcoin to find support and turn again, with the trend line area and moving average. Coupled with this tweet showing the exchanges having a big surge in deposits with a huge number ''buying the dip'' I felt confident in buying from that zone. Currently straight into profit from candle open. Will have to be careful with this position as it could just be a pullback so will see how the daily candle closes before moving stop loss. hope you caught it too GLIYF  \n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6gd0mlupgv61.png?width=1666&format=png&auto=webp&s=faebd53308561a1ec85875cab77bf502a3729979\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/acc5s9wupgv61.png?width=522&format=png&auto=webp&s=e730504da6bc0055f9a896284dc55f1b77ed2705",

AVAX go congested. Solana breaks down every other week. Polygon got rekt by a flower picking game.\n\nIf anything, other projects like Hedera have a way high chance of going mainstream cause of how efficient they are especially with HBAR foundation focusing so much on sustainable project development to the point where they\u2019re even allocating $100 million solely for that.\n\nYou have to understand that when I say \u201cmainstream\u201d I\u2019m talking millions of daily active users daily.\nSo unless there\u2019s a permanent solution or fix from the roots up, Ethereum going mainstream is something very far from reality.",

A sidechain is basically another instance of the chain with small changes in the parameters, like for example polygon has sacrificed decentralization to be able to process more transactions and it is using PoS instead of PoW.\n\nLayer 2 solutions on Ethereum as shown on L2beat.com are basically compression mechanisms for Ethereum which allows for much higher throughput. We are currently seeing massive innovation in both layer 2 solutions becoming better at compression and Ethereum as the layer 1 becoming better at supporting layer 2 solutions, this will lead to exponential scaling since if you get 2x improvement from the layer 2 and then also get a 2x improvement from Ethereum you total 4x improvement instead of just 2x if you didn't have the layer 2. Luckily we aren't just seeing 2x improvements but 10-100x on both layer 1 Ethereum layer 2s over the next couple of years. This is progressive prosess and currently scaling is outpacing demand.\n\nL2fees.info let's you see the tx cost on the different layer 2 solutions",

Its simply not sustainable in any shape or form.\n\nHonestly I think something like Hedera would much more likely go mainstream for how much more sustainable it really is especially with HBAR foundation focusing so much of sustainable project development to the point where they even allocated $100 million just for that.\n\nLike I said, I love Ethereum.

These projects are turning crowdfunding\u00a0of\u00a0video game projects into an opportunity to invest\u00a0in\u00a0video game projects. This is huge step forward. This is the SolanaPrime IDO dApp which will unleash the untapped potential of a global-scale, metaverse-based economy, monetized via community ownership. Game developers will finally be able to achieve financial success from their passion projects and gamers will be able to actually own part of the game and profit from its success. \n\nThis dApp is designed to be easily accessible to game developers. It will provide them with an opportunity to establish a direct relationship with fans and forward-looking investors, instantly eliminating current obstacles such as funding difficulties and creative pressures. It will allow gamers to move their in-game capital more freely between gaming worlds and the real world. SolanaPrime will facilitate the confluence between real gameplay and true value creation, finally unleashing the substantial power of GameFi.

            "text": "The idea behind Ethereum is ingenious: Connect computers from all over the world to build the most decentralized world-computer possible. However, we also all have seen the problems of the current, monolithic \u201cone blockchain fits all\u201d solution: Exploding fees, clogged network, long processing times and subsequently slow adoption in the real-world. You have all heard about Ethereum layer 2 solutions like Elrond or Polygon. But have you ever considered to solve Ethereums problems by seeing it as a second layer of an even more fundamental network?\n\nThis is exactly the strategy the IOTA foundation revealed with its recent IOTA smart contract protocol (ISCP) beta release. \n\nThey made the unique decision to have smart contracts not as a part of their feeless base-layer (the \u201cTangle\u201d), but instead as a second layer solution. Each smart contract is one individual blockchain and is run by its own committee of nodes. This committee performs all smart contract computations internally and connects to the IOTA main-layer to create and send digital assets (NFTs, wrapped tokens, etc.) IOTA tokens and to communicate seamlessly with all other IOTA smart contract chains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Animation of how an IOTA smart contract chain \\(for example Ethereum mainnet\\) interacts with the underlying IOTA Tangle \\(normal transactions in blue\\).](https://i.redd.it/znpp6a3kzev71.gif)\n\nThis layout allows IOTA smart contracts to be extremely flexible in design, different for each usecase and each user, while bein extremely scalable. It is the antithesis of the \u201cone blockchain fits all\u201d paradigm, a true cooperative multi-blockchain environment. \n\n**IOTA smart contract chain can choose freely between:**\n\n\\- **Permissionless** (for high decentralization) **or permissioned** (for trusted consortia) validators\n\n\\- **PoW, PoS, PoX** or any other consensus mechanism\n\n\\- **Being feeless or getting paid in any currency** (outside of the network in fiat or other crypto currencies, with a currency minted inside your IOTA smart contract blockchain (i.e. ETH) or with the native IOTA token)\n\n\\- **Creating own internal tokens** (IOTA smart contract chains are complete blockchains after all)\n\n\\- **Communicate feeless and seamlessly with other SCs over the IOTA Tangle.** You can interact with other smart contracts, build complex multi-SC networks and send around data, L2 tokens (i.e. ETH) or IOTA-based L1 token to every other connected SC chain.\n\n\\- **Control IOTA tokens and IOTA digital assets on the Tangle**\n\n\\- **Use any programming language you want** (currently supported Rust, Go and **Solidity (Ethereum virtual machine)**, many more languages and bridges planned).\n\nAs you can see, IOTA smart contracts can be made in any way any company, government, DeFi developer, game-designer or private person would want them. It is a completely open playing field, a sandbox, ready to be flooded with ideas and use-cases.\n\n**The role of Ethereum in the IOTA smart contracts eco-system (\u201cApes together strong\u201d)**\n\nIOTA is not an Ethereum-killer, it is an Ethereum enabler.\n\nEthereum is plagued by unpredictable fees and a clogged network because every single Banano -> Squirtle-coin swap needs to be processed by this literal world-computer. Every crypto-kitty, gambling-app or other fun little smart-contract project today gets secured with the insane levels of hash-power a literal world-computer has to offer and in turn becomes slow and expensive. Yes, there is a thing as having TO MUCH security for your crypto application and your latest gambling roulette or smart-neighborhood application in a suburb of Buenos Aires is a prime example for that.\n\nAll these smaller and mid-size use-cases can now migrate onto the IOTA Tangle (IOTA 2.0 DevNet for now, mainnet next year) by creating their own, individual smart contract chains. Decentralized finance can for example be performed by smaller consortia using proof of stake on an individual smart contract chain. Gaming apps can be processed by just some dozens of validators instead of hundreds of thousands. Both speed and costs of DEXes would improve DRAMATICALLY \u2013 no more 100$ swaps that take one hour! We are talking DeFi happening in seconds and for the cost of mere cents. \n\n**So what\u00b4s the role of Ethereum here?**\n\nIn this new context Ethereum can be seen the most decentralized and highest security IOTA smart contract chain possible. It will be the go-to solution for REALLY high stake smart contracts like high value life-insurances or large real-estate trades.\n\nEthereum gains from being part of IOTA smart contract landscape:\n\n\\- High reliability and use-ability for high-value use-cases because it is less clogged by smaller projects and games\n\n\\- Seamless communication with ALL OTHER smart contracts on IOTA, even those which are impossible on Ethereum as of today (such as permissioned smart contracts by industry consortia)\n\n\\- A more diversified and therefore decentralized crypto-landscape, no single point-of-failure\n\nGrowth of the cryptocurrency space can only happen when technology evolves and projects work together \u2013 not \u201ckill\u201d each other. This is now possible in a previously unknown new direction: Not by adding second layers on top of Ethereum, but instead adding a \u201c**Layer 0**\u201d solution under its feet.\n\n**More details about IOTA smart contracts:**\n\n**IOTA blog:** https://blog.iota.org/iota-smart-contracts-beta-release/\n\n**Absolute beginner/non-programmer guide to create your own IOTA smart contracts:** \n\nhttps://iotaguide.notion.site/Setting-up-Metamask-for-IOTA-smart-contracts-fa52b6d49f3446e5947f8f37606c82cc\n\nhttps://iotaguide.notion.site/Creating-your-own-token-on-IOTA-smart-contracts-using-Solidity-No-programming-required-d61aeff320324f2a9cb76c620aa0ace4",

            "text": "Ethereum was initially a tech startup company and the Ether token was launched as a fundraising mechanism for the Ethereum business venture. They printed themselves to be the largest shareholder of Ether, approached a bunch of investors, pitched the investors a whitepaper and said if you give us money we will deliver you this roadmap and we will also print you a X% share of the network. To those from the business world, that sounds *a lot* like a stock offering. Ethereum even used the term \"IPO\" in their marketing, as the term \"ICO\" wasn't popular yet. 72 million Ether were premined, contrasting that to the 116 million current total Ether in circulation means that 62% of all current Ether supply was printed before the network even went live.\n\nXRP often gets dunked on for largely being a stock ticker for Ripple Labs, but there aren't very many differences between Ripple and Ethereum concerning the launch. Both launched as a premine and they both printed themselves a big bag to periodically sell to \"fund\" operations. **The Ethereum Foundation sold $115,000,000.00 of ETH on Kraken at the literal top on May 17th, 2021. (**[Link to etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3a7f91d3f35cb2f02125f2f83685f2fcaa0cd78513650fca49dedd7dc3faa1cf))**.** Jed McCaleb, founder of Ripple, also sold about $275,000,000.00 dollars worth of XRP in the month of May 2021.  Because of the similarities of the launches, the outcome of the SEC vs Ripple court case in the US will likely also negatively affect the legal status of Ethereum.\n\nVitalik Buturin and the Ethereum Foundation together **hold a whopping $3,000,000,000.00 USD** worth of Ethereum in their publicly disclosed wallets that they printed for themselves. Maybe I'm off base here, but I don't think billions of dollars are necessary to \"fund\" a small team of developers. What are they even doing with all of that money?  I dug around on their website, **I found no documents disclosing what they do with their funds**. Moreover, Vitalik was recently on a Lex Friedman podcast talking about his trading habits with other coins, and Vitalik discussed how he tried to time the top on certain coins like Dogecoin this market cycle. That discussion raised my eyebrows because I never recalled hearing Vitalik disclose that he owned any other wallets. I decided to dig through their website to find anywhere where they disclose their other wallets... **and again, I found no such disclosures**. Since Vitalik is confirmed to have undisclosed crypto investments, it's safe to assume that Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation likely hold **significantly** more Ethereum than what is known in the publicly disclosed wallets. Since there are no regulations in crypto, Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation have no legal obligation to be transparent about any of their finances or trades.\n\nDo you really think Ethereum would have spent the last 5 years working towards transitioning to PoS if the founders didn't hold large ETH stacks?  The day PoS goes live on the Ethereum mainnet, is the day that both Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation's wallets become permanent endowment funds, essentially, destined to forever sit as King of the Hill, collecting taxes as staking rewards while being mathematically shielded from ever seeing their controlled market share diminish.\n\nI guess the point I'm making is that *Ethereum didn't have to launch like this*. They could have had a clean, immaculate conception like Bitcoin. Proof of work consensus chains are supposed to start at the genesis block, the premine was 100% unnecessarily tacked on to self-serve the financial interests of the founders. Rather than making Ethereum a fully decentralized public good, the team opted to make Ethereum their own private business venture.",

However, can the top\u00a0altcoin\u00a0sustain the bull run and reach $3,000?\n\nThe top altcoin has surged 23.6% over the past week, with a 5.4% gain in the last 24 hours. In fact, ETH price has been rising steadily in a cup and handle pattern. The pattern is a bullish indicator that means the crypto might still rise even more\n\n[https://coinquora.com/ethereum-hits-2146-55-ath-and-surges-towards-3000/](https://coinquora.com/ethereum-hits-2146-55-ath-and-surges-towards-3000/)",

These projects get hyped and pumped based on nothing real and value dissolves as fast as it comes. Then there are projects that have solved big problems for the industry, and have already presented complete working products with in licensing and can\u2019t say much publicly due to the nature of that licensing. \n\nBanking is one of those industries where you can\u2019t have an application under review with the government while at the same time blowing up the internet with fancy marketing. When the license approval comes through all of this will change. \n\nWhen the general public begins to understand what first blockchain bank is Proton will see immediate dramatic growth  in value but it doesn\u2019t take any effort to see where this is going to go.\n\nHow many times have you heard of not just crypto but other industries denied banking?  \n\n**Here is a quick summary of XPR**\n\n\n- zero fees \n- smart contracts \n- 4000 (!) transactions per second \n- universal names no more difficult wallet numbers\n- nft marketplace \n- mint nfts for **1** (!) cent (ETH is $30+)\n- Erc-20 wrapping \n\nThis marks the **first** time that Ethereum-based tokens can be sent between users instantly and with no gas fees\n\n- Long staking allows users to lock their XPR into a contract that is tied to the performance of Bitcoin\n- proton swap \n- Open Source Wallet SDK\n- ESR protocol allows for an application (dapp) to generate signature requests (transactions) which can then be passed to signers (wallets) for signature creation. \n\n- **0,5 seconds block time that is **faster** than**\n\n- Ethereum\n- Dot\n- Ada\n- Algorand\n- Stellar \n- Hbar\n- Tron \n- Ripple \n- Luna \n- Ftm\n- Bts \n- Iost \n- Lto \n- Icx\n- Zill\n- Qtum\n- Nano\n\n**As a matter of fact it is the fastest.

A group of 45 peops.\n\nI had never heard about it until the other day, so there's been no marketing whatsoever. This will pick up - esp due to it's price and current marketcap.\n\nSo far i've only sent ETH to the wallet and it automatically converted my ETH into the native ETH on the proton blockchain (xETH), which was cool. I then swapped for proton. I may stake for 3 months.\n\nTheir long term staking is kinda cool. If bitcoin drops a lot - your safe. It bitcoin rises, you still get your investment back + x amount of whatever you put in.\n\nIt's like a crypto savings that auto swaps off chain crypto. You can send to people using @ names like twitter or something. NFT is coming (beta is out), with near zero cost to mint. When more people become aware of this it will no longer be like 0.015 cents or whatever it is.\n\nCheers",

Last time I posted the setup on ETH we had just poked up above the Demand zone in the middle, which was the one that created the push through the previously held supply zone . So we knew that was a strong area. Since then you had two opportunities to buy in from that zone for when you hit TP projection. Currently still trading above TP area. ETH has had a lot of good positive news which helped up price even when BTC and the rest dropped back. So if your HODLing or trading you're in the profits. I think we could see ETH hit 3K at some point, so I would buy in again at the demand zone below if we got there.

            "text": "Disclaimer smooth brain and have only been in cryptocurrency for short time but wanted to type up a project I came across that I think has massive potential, so much so that I invested a large portion of my portfolio into.  Dracula Protocol V2 launched earlier today (April 30th) and is **supported by partnerships with Rari capital and Sushiswap**. Audited by Solidity Finance in addition to numerous internal and partner audits.  Dracula offers two main advantages as a DeFi App:\n\n1. Allows earning of daily auto-compounded ETH or DRC via farming on the Ethereum chain.  While normally this is cost prohibitive or counter intuitive to profit margin it is crowd sourced allowing an investor of any size to earn rewards like he is a whale.\n2. Governing several top DeFi projects via delegated governance.  To better understand  the innate economic value of delegated governance I would recommend Bankless podcast episode #62 Governance and Capital with Joel Monegro. Will cover a bit more down below.\n\nThe biggest challenge for the average or new DeFi investor is leveraging value from Eth.  They settle for an easy solution like Celsius and earn a meager 4-5% APR or ETH staking around 7% on centralized exchange locking up their ETH for at least a year.  Others will try LP or leverage via loans but this carries a liquidation risk or impermanent loss risk.  Additionally, the gas fees to set these up either mean you must wait months or have a large initial amount of capital to be worthwhile.  Dracula Protocol V2 offers a solution to all these problems.  You can simply stake your DRC tokens or specified LP tokens from Dodo, Sushiswap, Pickle, LuaSwap, or Uniswap onto the Dracula V2 website and earn ETH or DRC your choice.  Its that easy.\n\n**The beauty of Dracula is that it is not competing for TVL from Dodo, Sushi, Uniswap, and others but rather it is a means to leverage an already owned LP token.**  Dracula allows LP providers an additional avenue to earn profits; the extra profit can help to offset or eliminate impermanent loss.  Users can get their reward in either DRC or Eth which can then be re-invested or leveraged elsewhere.\n\nWhile you farm on Dracula, a small amount of rewards from partner projects goes to Dracula Protocol vault.  Overtime these small amounts will earn more voting sway.  Imagine the economic value of owning 5-10% of governance of a multibillion DEX like Uniswap and allowing DRC holders to help formulate future policies which best benefit them.\n\nAre you not convinced?  I opened by telling you about the Sushi and Dracula partnership.  I am very curious about how Dracula will be implemented into Sushi.  I have a couple ideas and it was teased during a podcast featuring the Dracula founder Farmer Brown that it will involve implementation in Sushi UI.  Limitless possibilities.  Do your own research, I hope I at least gave you a viable option to leverage your ETH.",

Smart vs. dumb money isn't professional vs. retail as is often cast (by pros), but DYOR vs. mindless trend follower.  I'm proud of how often these past few years retail has done better research than the so-called pros.  So below you'll see some opinion that's not verifiable, you'll just have to weigh it yourself and you'll see references to adoption and stats that can be verified with your favorite search engine or hard work staring at charts.  DYOR or don't, your call.  \n\nAt this and other accounts over the past five years I've come across many of the same questions over and over again, so I'm going to recount the most popular ones here.  The TL;DR is the title.  Litecoin is deep clucking value.  If you want more than that, you have some reading to do, though I will bold a few important parts.  \n\n**Q.** Isn't Litecoin dead?  \n**A.** Litecoin as a network is more alive than ever.  On chain transactions, active addresses and volume have thrived relative to the market through bear markets and bull.  Recent stats from Bitpay confirm what can be seen onchain, Litecoin remains one of the most popular altcoins to use.  In just three months after being added, Litecoin beat every altcoin on Bitpay including those that had a 4 year head start to build up their userbase there.  If anyone had told you that would happen, you would have snorted Pepsi through your nose in laughter.  It should tell you something about your priors that it did happen.  \n\n**Q.** How can Litecoin still matter since it's no different than any other low fee currency coin?  \n**A.** It's all about the fundamentals.  Lots of coins have some element in common with Litecoin or another, but not one, not even bitcoin, has them all.  The whole is greater than the sum of the parts which is why Litecoin celebrated an 10 year birthday with 100% up time, something no other relevant altcoin has ever done.  It's why it's forgotten more crypto winters than most coins will ever see.  No matter how many times it's declared dead, just like it's big brother, Litecoin will never stop.  \n\n**Q.** Wait a second, there are no fundamentals in crypto.  CNBC said so.  \n**A.** Fundamentals don't drive everything in any market, obviously.  And yes, a very large percentage of cryptos are driven entirely by hype, a different set every cycle.  There has to be a new set of pure hype cryptos every cycle because those almost never survive the crypto winter (the one exception is telling, Litecoin's little brother Doge sheltered from the cryptowinter by merged mining with LTC).  The Bitcoin killers came in the first cycle.  In the next cycle there were mostly ICO non-native tokens.  This cycle there are the Ethereum killers and meme tokens.  \n\nBut fundamentals are vital to the big three, Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum.  And the key fundamental is network effect.  If you read nothing else today and even if you'll never care about Litecoin, lock in on this truism: Network effect can't be gitcloned.  The longer infrastructure and social norms takes to build, the more expensive the cost of it, the harder it is to tear down.  Hype based coins fade to nothing when the hype fades, tech based coins can have their tech gitcloned by anyone.  Infrastructure based coins keep coming back over and over.    \n\n**Q.** You can't possibly be comparing LTC with BTC and ETH\u2026  \n**A.**  That's the league.  4th place isn't even close.  In this space, eth is the smart contracts winner, bitcoin is the store of value winner and Litecoin is the medium of transaction winner.  The real mind blower for a lot of people who desperately want to hate on everything but their favorite coin is that none of these coins compete with each other.  Nor should they try.  As interoperability grows through second layers, this triad will endure not only longer than 99.9% of other cryptos, but longer than most fiat currencies as well, maybe even longer than all of them.  \n\n**Q.** If Litecoin is elite how come I haven't heard anything about it in years?  \n**A. Just in recent times, Litecoin has added Paypal, Venmo, Bitpay, Verifone, AMC, Newegg, Interactive Brokers among others and Grayscale announced they're eager to move the popular LTCN trust into a spot ETF as soon as the SEC will allow.  On the development front Omnilite was launched in September, MWEB is finishing up a multiyear development phase with audits and revisions and taproot is on deck.  Litecoin progress is so common, it's not even newsworthy anymore.  Rain is wet, Litecoin is growing, story at 11.**  \n\nThere are, of course, competing coin communities that try to shape news stories to exclude the word Litecoin.  Post a thread in the cryptocurrency sub with the word Litecoin in the title, the downvotes come fast and furious (certain times of day, they come even faster).  Post the same story, about say, AMC adding several cryptos and exclude the word Litecoin, and the reaction is far more positive.  So by aggressively downvoting LTC material, other posters even with no dog in the fight, are incentivized to leave out the constantly present Litecoin from their posts, and many people who aren't looking beyond the headlines don't realize Litecoin is in so many of them.  \n\n**Q.** Let's go back, you said no other coin had all of Litecoin's elements, what blend sets it apart?  \n**A.** Litecoin's major advantage is network effect, in two parts.  The first part is infrastructure.  Network effects consist of all users, not just people.  Exchanges, payment processors, retailers, software, ATMs, far flung b2b cross border payments in regions with limited/no access to secure, affordable financial services, OTC desks, trusts, ETFs, everything that can be built is part of network effect, and the more it costs to build it, the more durable it tends to be.  Much infrastructure slapped up around new coins today is cheaply gotten and will be quickly lost when hype fades.  \n\nAs an aside, something no one here will believe or understand, Litecoin's most important user is Bitcoin.  More on this is another question.  Not Bitcoiners, the people, though the close cultural/development relationship between LTC and BTC helps, but bitcoin the network is a user of Litecoin.  This is a huge part of how Litecoin has thrived all these years and built up so much other antifragile infrastructure.  \n\nThe second part of network effect is more obvious, actual people.  All of those infrastructure elements rely on the more  users to maintain them.  If there isn't constant liquidity and volume in good times and bad, as many who've been here through multiple cycles know, coins get delisted and removed.  Many removed coins needed to only provide liquidity to a tiny number of exchanges and still fail.  Litecoin has provided liquidity and volume enough for virtually every exchange, payment processor and other element out there, and has done so consistently over ten years.  The network effect has grown far beyond what second tier alts can fathom.  \n\nLitecoin's minor advantages are more feature based, and many are boring, but also vital to its success.  Quickly, yes, Litecoin is low fee separating it from both Ethereum and Bitcoin.  But it also has world class security in the form of multigenerationally evolved ASICs that are globally distributed on an algo Litecoin is superdominant on, separating it from most other altcoins.  Additionally Litecoin's fair launch, fairly mined status along with its lack of a founder stash separate it massively from the new hype coins which are heavily centralized, and centralization is risk.  \n\nLitecoin's subcent fees are not unique among alts.  It's security and network effect including constant liquidity and healthy volume is not unique among the top three, BTC, LTC, ETH.  Its decentralization is not unique among the top two, BTC is on par.  **But when you piece it all together you have with Litecoin a network unlike any other.**  \n\n**Q.** Ok, time to get back to that weird aside, how can bitcoin as a network be a user of the Litecoin network?  \n**A.**  Yes, **Bitcoin is Litecoin's most important user**.  This happens in several ways and the relationship is growing more intertwined as second layers continue to evolve.  \n\nDevelopment synergy has been a big part of this.  Litecoin has in the past been called a testnet for bitcoin.  This was often used as a derogatory term, as testnet coins are valueless.  **The very real advantage that Litecoin offered bitcoin was as a test market, one which not only roughly tested basic functionality of tech as a testnet does, but also tested how market participants, both white hat and black hat, reacted to it.**  You can't really test security on a testnet because the bad guys aren't incentivized to try and break through the security, there's no payoff.  You can't test regulatory reactions or infrastructure partners or a many others because most don't know or care what testnets are.  The only way to see how a real market will really react is to bring the tech to real market participants on a large scale.  Because of Litecoin's constant use and broad infrastructure support, as well as its codebase being kept very close to bitcoin's, it's the perfect test market.  \n\nWhat many don't realize is that the synergy goes both ways.  Litecoin actually has 100% uptime while Bitcoin is in the 99.98% range because while Litecoin tends to test rare controversial upgrades, like Segwit/lightning and MWEB, on Bitcoin's behalf, Bitcoin is testing all the non-controversial updates for Litecoin, like, most recently, taproot.  So Litecoin uses Bitcoin too.  \n\nThe block wars of 2017 are instructive in how this all works.  Big blockers did everything they could to stop segwit from activating, and heavily delayed it long after everyone capable of understanding the tech (even its detractors) realized it was perfectly safe and useful.  In early 2017, Charlie Lee stepped up and said Litecoin would activate it first, plow the road to prove it up.  Along the way alongside bitcoin allies, the Litecoin community helped develop the winning strategy that got bitcoin through activation later that year, the UASF.  Litecoin didn't used the UASF, but the billionaire mining consortium that was blocking progress didn't fold until Charlie came out publicly in favor of it, and that folding told everyone everything they needed to know about how to defeat the big blockers.  \n\nAfter activation, Charlie put $1 million of his own money into a segwit address and dared big blockers to steal it.  Old timers might understand why, but if you've come around more recently, that fud at that time coming from people who 100% knew it wasn't true, was that any value stored in a segwit address could be stolen, it wasn't safe.  This helped paralyze the market and prevent activation.  Once Charlie put the million dollar segwit bounty up and it went untouched, the fud died so hard that most now don't even remember it was a thing.  More about Charlie later, but this is the moment he earned most of his enemies, and just as they lied viciously to stop lightning adoption then, they lied viciously about him to get revenge after he was so instrumental in helping Bitcoin through that civil war.  \n\nOf, course, the Litecoin community wasn't being purely selfless by adopting segwit and lightning, something that people then and even many still today fear would obviate the need for faster cheaper altcoins.  Litecoin has understood very early on that the most impressive feature of lightning was not fast cheap offchain transactions, but cross chain transactions.  When I said Bitcoin would use Litecoin even more in the future than in the past, this is what I meant.  \n\n**In the future I believe Bitcoin and Litecoin will flow seamlessly and constantly across the lightning network and mutually reinforce each other's security.  I believe coffee is not an endgame for lightning, it's just how to get the liquidity kickstarted.  In the future I believe the entire world will touch lightning every day, most without realizing it, and that layer will be their most frequent interaction with the underlying networks.  In that scenario, in order to attack the lightning backbone and either take it down or spam it, you'd have to simultaneously take on both the underlying bitcoin and Litecoin networks, thus mutual reinforcement.  If only one fails, traffic can temporarily divert final settlement to the other chain until the downed chain returns.  The cost of such an attack, both in dollars and logistical complications will further discourage any attack from ever taking place.**  \n\nYes, Bitcoin is the most important user of Litecoin.  In the early days people often used Litecoin as a quick arbitrage coin to move value between exchanges and save fees.  This was but a shadow of things to come.  Combined with Litecoin's other redeeming qualities discussed in several questions above, it's closeness to bitcoin in code and culture have made it silver to bitcoin's gold in more ways than most will ever acknowledge.  But in addition to some market based behaviours that are similar between silver and gold such as price oscillation, remember that Litecoin is also robin to bitcoin's batman, Daniel-san to Bitcoin's Miyagi, Pippen to Bitcoin's Jordan and a wink to Bitcoin's smile.  Litecoin has outlasted untold bitcoin killers precisely because it never even tried to compete with bitcoin, but to help it, and in the process it has carved out its own lane to dominate and thrive with a little help from its most important user, Bitcoin.  \n\nAs a result of this longstanding and growing affiliation, software and infrastructure that is quick to add bitcoin is usually pretty quick to add Litecoin.  And then users who are friendly to bitcoin are more friendly to Litecoin, ensuring enough volume and liquidity to maintain that infrastructure over time.  \n\n**Q.** If Charlie dumped all his Litecoins, why would I want to hold them?  \n**A.** Often the implication of people who drop in to say the founder of Litecoin dumped his coins want to leave you with the impression that he left the project without actually having to lie and say that.  He not only didn't leave, he's been more active and more successful at helping Litecoin build adoption and infrastructure than he was before he divested.  \n\nHe still uses Litecoin at every opportunity, including to make purchases to donate to Litecoin development.  In the recent multiyear MWEB development rollout, funded entirely by community donations, Charlie personally matched every donation made.  He's donated to other causes as well for both adoption and development and is almost certainly the largest donor so far, though other large donors like Ryan Wright are starting to step up as well.  \n\nCharlie was being harassed before he divested with every Litecoin news item he posted accusing him of pumping and dumping on hype.  Tons of founders and ICO scam artists were doing exactly that at the time, and Charlie figured that by divesting, he could assure everyone that his efforts and posts were to build Litecoin up rather than trying to profit off pumps and dumps.  He underestimated the trolls, mostly big blockers back then, who then made his divestment their new favorite talking point, trying to make people think he'd abandoned the project.  \n\nBut in the course of divesting I think mostly for that reason, he accomplished something far more important that I alluded to in an earlier question.  Litecoin now has no founder's stash, an element of decentralization that sets it apart from even the king of decentralization, Bitcoin.  In many ways, Charlie has mirrored what Satoshi did when he actually stepped away from the project, abandoning bitcoin.  Satoshi left and kept his coins.  Charlie stayed and divested.  \n\nI would imagine in the end both bitcoin and Litecoin will end up equal on these fronts, that eventually Charlie will move on, as a coin founder of a decentralized, public blockchain should, and that Satoshi's coins will be circulated as well, so neither will have either a founder's stash nor an active founder leading the community.  For now, whatever his motivation, I find Litecoin more appealing for its lack of a founder's stash.  \n\n**Q.**  So you think Charlie is a saint or something?  \n**A.**  Nah, he's a pretty normal, chill dude.  As human as anyone, just trying to figure things out as he goes.  Not unlike Satoshi.  I think Charlie's instincts are far more appropriate to a truly decentralized space than most coin founder who do act like CEOs even though they claim to control a decentralized blockchain rather than a centralized security/company.  \n\nI think it would surprise most to hear that Charlie has said repeatedly he made more money out of bitcoin than Litecoin.  It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.  He founded Litecoin in 2011, just two years after bitcoin launched, and he was obviously into bitcoin before that.  He had a similar experience to many of us, bought some when people were talking about, and it went down after, but for anyone who got in then and stayed, I mean of course he made a fortune on bitcoin.  And since Litecoin was fairly launched and he was just one miner alongside everyone else who at the time was eager for a coin to mine with lesser hardware than bitcoin by then required, his stash was never the size of Satoshi's, much less of these huge premined, ICO'd, centralized coin launches that are more common today.  \n\nI especially think the hate around him is based on transparent lies.  Don't believe me, DYOR.  Step past the trolls for a bit and get to know him yourself.  He's soft-spoken, the worst hype-master ever (my highest compliment for anyone), nice, and a constant advocate for bitcoin as well as Litecoin, something very in sync with the Litecoin community as a whole.  We're all Bitcoiners in addition to being Litecoiners.  \n\n**Q.** Doesn't Litecoin's success just comes from it being old?  \n**A.** Many old coins died out.  Litecoin isn't even the oldest, it's just the oldest that has thrived.  It thrived for many of the reasons that have already been laid out.  The high marks on decentralization helped, the close, affectionate relationship with bitcoin helped, the low fees combined with deep and broad security helped, and yes, time helped too.  \n\nBut it's not \"just\" old.  **Litecoin got old and outlived so many failed projects because it made so many right choices along the way.**  \n\n**Q.** If Litecoin is so great, why is the price so low?  \n**A.** Ah, yes, well, fundamentals are\u2026fun, but of course price matters.  Litecoin wouldn't be deep clucking value if there weren't appreciation in its future.  \n\nThat's the first thing you have to think about here.  Do you want to hop on board a project that already has most of its price appreciation in the past, or one that still has most of it's price appreciation ahead of it.  Trend following does pay off for some people, but probably not as many as you think.  I've seen trend followers lose money in every kind of market.  Even in raging bull markets they fomo in at the top, panic sell the bottom of the next move, then buy back in even higher than first time, multiplying losses over time.  And even if a trend follower gets in before the end of crypto's often accelerated trends, they are often more quiet about how much they lose on the trends that end right when the jump in.  \n\n**Litecoin is an amazing trading coin precisely because it has predictability.**  You don't have to wonder whether it's cheap or expensive, it has the most established ratio price history of any coin against bitcoin, and for that matter, the most usefully established history against eth as well.  Both ratios are extremely useful trading pairs (even if you to do a multihop trade on an exchange that doesn't have the pair directly) against Litecoin.  \n\nSince this is a proDYOR post, I'm not going to tell you where the cheap ratios and expensive ratios are.  But the good news is, it's really, really easy to find on the chart.  The trend followers would look at a ltcbtc or ltceth chart and jump on anything but ltc.  A deep value investor will zoom out and look at what happened when litecoin was in a similar position in previous cycles.  \n\n**Q.** C'mon.  BTC has exceeded 3x its 2017 ATH, ETH has done similar.  You have to admit LTC has failed is now going to fade to nothing.  \n**A.** Litecoin's lagging price is a feature, not a bug, and it's not new.  Litecoin tends to price in progress all at once.  The benefit of that is that you have much longer, cheaper accumulation periods than with coins that price in more gradually where each buy is more expensive than the last.  \n\nHere's the fiat price pattern to look for.  Litecoin leads all coins, even bitcoin, out of crypto winter.  It did 7x in 2015, 6x in 2019 (probably could've gotten higher but Novogratz bandwagoned a short campaign against it as it led the recovery rally, he failed and I wouldn't be surprised if he lost money on the bounce, but did put a little dent in highs).  Then Litecoin hibernates around 18 months while other coins take off in succession, first bitcoin, then eth, then lots of others.  In spring of 2017 and spring of 2021, Litecoin was off to the races in almost a perfect reflection of past price action, and most of you know what happened next.  Maypocolypse affected some coins more than others, those that finished a rally well above their old ATHs before that date fared much better than those that were just cycling up for their run.  \n\nHad maypocolypse happened in august instead, Litecoin likely would have reached $1000 before crashing back down to $400 or so, just as in 2017 it reached $100 before crashing back around the old 2013 high, and then set up for another year end rally to finish off in fine fashion.  \n\nNow you can look at that maypocolypse price action and find your bias confirmed if you please.  But I think the more clever and studious will see an even more extended opportunity to buy Litecoin cheap than exists in even a standard cycle.  Bouyed by fundamentals and with long term price action far more visible than on newer, flimsier projects, Litecoin shows a base of epic proportions.  \n\nThose of us who've had success trading litecoin have used it as an oscillator.  When Litecoin is strong against bitcoin or eth, as it was dominating them in 2019, that's a good time to use your Litecoin to buy bitcoin or eth.  When Litecoin is weak against them, as it is now, it's a great time to use eth and btc to buy Litecoin.  Look at the charts yourself.  It's a killer trade with incredible intelligence about what \"strong\" and \"weak\" mean buried everywhere in the long term price action.  \n\nAnyone ever hear the phrase, \"the longer the base, the higher in space?\"  We're about to find out if it's true.  I can't think of a better test case than Litecoin given all the substance it has under the surface.  This is the ultimate all cattle, no hat crypto, and even if all you want to do is check and see if substance matters, if hype is the only thing real in crypto as the nocoiners believe, watch Litecoin.  It's the proof in the pudding.  Deep Clucking Value.  \n\n**Q.**  Why is the value\u2026 clucking?  Are you having a stroke?  \n**A. The longtime mascot of Litecoin is the Chicken**, normally spelled chikun for the normal memey reasons.  The chikun is the mainstay of litecoin gifs and posts.  I've been known to respond to fudsters with a hearty \"yipeekiyay mothercluckers\", myself.  That one hasn't really taken off, but I'm trying to get it going.  \n\n**Q.** TL;DR?  \n**A. Litecoin is Deep Clucking Value.**",

What at   first sight appears to be a bunch of disconnected buzzwords and   developments recently flying through the digital space is a single, huge   digital revolution taking off as you read this.\n\nThe talk is about the **Web3** with its credo \u201cread, write and OWN\u201d. It is about new ways to organize people in **DAOs**   (decentralized, autonomous organizations). And it is about the   expansion of our digital experience into the physical world via virtual   and augmented reality, called the **Metaverse**.\n\nAll   these developments point in the same direction: They all drastically   deepen our digital experience and progressively blur the lines between   the digital and the physical world. In the future we will own our own   data and digital identities, organize in democratic digital societies   independent of which state we live in and we will share digital assets   and money without any middlemen or centralized banks.\n\nIn short: what we are witnessing is the **fourth industrial revolution.**\n\n**But there\u00b4s a hook:**   All these developments require distributed ledger technologies (DLTs)   that are much more powerful than any network running today.\n\n**Technologies   today are not advanced enough to enable a fully realized Web3 and   Metaverse. High fees, low throughput and low composability between   protocols are major, unresolved roadblocks.**\n\nAs   of today, there is not a single DLT that would be able to handle the   fourth industrial revolution. We are talking millions of tps, fully   dynamic and seamless transactions between protocols of a myriad of   digital assets \u2013 from crypto-currencies, NFTs, tokenized assets, digital   identities and many more \u2013 all running in parallel on multi-asset   networks and with great user experience.\n\nThe   problem here is the monolithic \u201cone-chain-fits-all\u201d dogma that is  still  going viral within the cryptocurrency space. People still try to  run  EVERY smart contract inside one single blockchain (like Ethereum,   Cardano or Solana) and therefore inescapably run into unbearable fees   and clogged networks, even at comparatively tiny global usage.   Developers try to fight their way out by deploying layer 2 solutions on   top of these monolithic chains, still not questioning the fundamental   dogma. In consequence, many already run into the same problems: If   everyone would use one of these L2\u00b4s they would quickly be clogged and   plagued by exploding fees too. To make things worse, smart contracts   that run in different L2\u00b4s cannot call upon each other\u00b4s output anymore,   which destroys one of the fundamental pillars of rapid progress:   composability (\u201cLego-like\u201d building of complex programs).\n\n**IOTA fixes that**\n\nIOTA   is famous for its daring technological concepts, from feeless   transactions to its fundamental data-structure (a DAG, not a   blockchain). Recently, the IOTA Foundation revealed their solution for   near infinitely scalable and interoperable scaling solutions: The IOTA   smart contract protocol (ISCP) and the Assembly network.\n\nIOTAs   core idea is to put its smart contracts not inside the base-layer,  like  Ethereum and others do, but fully on the second layer with  individual  IOTA smart contract chains. Each smart contract chain is in  every regard  its very own blockchain, with its own validators that only  process  their own, internal smart contracts. No need to worry anymore  about  every little crypto-kitty dApp and smart neighborhood in La  Ligula,  Chile, eating up very limited shared blockchain throughput and  thereby  raising fees. IOTA smart contract chains can control addresses  on the  shared base-layer, IOTAs Tangle, to create and send around   cryptocurrencies (plural!), NFTs, custom coins and digital identities.   All these digital assets can run in parallel on IOTAs multi-asset   ledger. Other smart contracts can them pick up and use them inside their   own smart contract chain ecosystem. A multiverse of interconnected   ecosystems appears, all connected by a feeless connective tissue: IOTAs   Tangle.\n\n**The upsides of this approach are obvious:**\n\n\\-  **Near infinite, horizontal scaling**\n\n\\-  **Individual smart contract chains are fully customizable**\n\no **Free choice of fee structure (even feeless smart contracts!)**\n\no **Free choice of programming language**\n\no **Free choice of validators**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The missing puzzle piece: IOTA Assembly network**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Official Assembly info-graphic](https://preview.redd.it/y78qtbzaai381.png?width=2534&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a08bc523f4a5dd16bc2d12a401d6e6ddb512723)\n\nUp   until now, a major piece in making IOTA smart contracts fit to support   the digital revolution was missing: The validators needed to be chosen   by the smart contract creators, effectively allowing only centralized   smart contracts.\n\nHowever, the IOTA foundation just published its solution for both horizontally scaling AND decentralized smart contracts: the **Assembly network** ($ASMB).\n\nThis network acts as a **validator marketplace**.   Smart contract validators (= node owners) can join the Assembly  network  and work up their reputation by offering a high stake as well  as  providing a history of good behavior.\n\nA   smart contract owner that wants to let their code run decentralized  can  ask the Assembly network for validators of a certain quality (*i.e.*   minimum stake, minimum reputation, etc.) and offer fees in exchange.   Validators that fit these requirements get automatically and randomly   assigned to validate these smart contracts. If a validator misbehaves   (even if it did not yet affect the outcome of the smart contract,   because there was a majority of honest validators), its stake and   reputation gets slashed and it gets removed from the validator pool.\n\n**This means IOTA smart contracts solved the crypto trilemma on the smart-contract level:**\n\n**Horizontal scaling =** Near infinitely scalable\n\n**Individual smart contract chains =** FAST smart contracts\n\n**Assembly network =** Fully decentralized smart contracts\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Metaverse can start soon\u2122 - Facebook (now \u201cMeta\u201d) and Winkelvoss brothers searching for Metaverse technology**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Screenshot from IOTA Discord](https://preview.redd.it/xorb0s5dai381.png?width=1105&format=png&auto=webp&s=368565768503124eb9b8d4b9e6b61c0c88839e28)\n\nThis   technological jump in crypto technology comes right at a time where   industry giants like Meta and crypto-legends like the Winkelvoss   brothers are raising hundreds of millions of Dollars in order to build   the Metaverse and Web3.

They are   actively looking for technology that can enable their visions and   although we are entering here the realm of speculation it is clear that   they will only be able to pick fully interoperable and hyper-scalable   DLTs as a base-layer for their endavours.\n\nOn   top of that the IOTA Foundation said there is over a dozen partners   involved in the start of the Assembly network, which will be revealed   over the coming weeks. These partners were strategically chosen to   represent different markets and regions and pledged to invest at least   $180 into Assembly ecosystem building. With this starting package a very   high visibility towards Winkelvoss and Meta is highly ensured.

            "text": "The Good\n\nNo more <1% interest rates, no more management fees, no more discrimination, no more paperwork, and no more long lines. And you can actually beat inflation with passive income and living off of interest. Bonus points because you can do so while being invested in crypto.\n\nWith Defi you can *Be Your Own Bank* and do most things that a financial institution would do without getting discriminated and without paying someone to give you access. In addition, because defi is open-sourced and collaborative, it works like Legos\u2014dapps building on top of one another. This makes defi hyper-efficient unlike traditional finance, which is inherently closed in nature.\n\nThe Bad\n\nBanks exist for a reason. It's not easy to 'Be Your Own Bank'. It's not easy to set up all these accounts and manage multiple assets across a number of platforms. And\u2014when I first used it\u2014Defi wasn't very user-friendly at all. Here's what I had to do:\n\n1. Buy a stablecoin from a centralized exchange\n2. Trade the stablecoin for the gas token (ETH for Ethereum, MATIC for Polygon, etc.)\n3. Install a Web3 wallet (then for Metamask, you had to manually add the network details)\n4. Secure the private key\n5. Send token to Web3 wallet (did a test transaction first, as always!)\n6. Connect Web3 wallet to the dapps I was using\n7. Approve the tokens in the dapp\n8. Swap, deposit, and finally do defi things\n\nIt took me 2 hours to set up a Web3 wallet for the first time (takes me 5 mins now). On the early days, you didn't have on-ramps yet for networks like Polygon so the initial onboarding was expensive. I avoided most of the fees by going to BSC first and then bridging to Polygon, which involves extra steps like *buying BNB > sending it to wallet > setting up a bridge dapp > sending BNB from BSC to Polygon > approving the unwrapped BNB > unwrapping the BNB > swapping coins/tokens*\n\nAnother difficulty of being your own bank is that you're solely responsible for managing your assets now. So when crypto crashed in May, I had to manage my positions. I remember being quite frantic, moving all of my assets\u2014spread around multiple dapps\u2014and also rushing to funnel money in to manage my positions.\n\nOf course, I was never in any REAL danger, *per se.* I think I was \\~20% away from paying liquidation fees at that time; but that was pretty much the floor amount of risk that I wanted to be in. Still, if I wasn't actively managing my positions, I would've been punished when the market continued to crash. If I wasn't online--for example, if I was out on vacation--then, quite frankly, I'd be royally f\\*cked.\n\nThe Ugly\n\nA study recently came out that \\~50% Liquidity pool (LP) providers using Uniswap were at a net loss while participating in a LP compared to if they just held their assets. This is because of impermanent loss. I reckon, this would also translate to most of Defi at its current state.\n\nImpermanent loss is a major issue in Defi and also one that newcomers will typically be encounter. And it\u2019s hard to spot also because you aren\u2019t always losing money. Sometimes, you would\u2019ve just been better off putting your money elsewhere.\n\nI realized this when I was using the SOL-RAY pool while on the Solana ecosystem. This was around July to October when Solana had its run up. LPs are actually great if the market isn\u2019t pumping. I wish I knew this earlier because when Solana did pump, despite earning 70% APY on the LP fees, I was actually down $200 had I just held SOL, which did a 8x while RAY only did a 4x.\n\nAnd the current state of Defi is undeniably unsustainable. The way most of it works is that protocols incentivize users with high rates but high rates are only possible with high inflation. High rates will cause high demand, because everyone wants a piece of the pie, and high demands inflates the price. At first, this makes it seem like a good opportunity (because price is rising while rates are high) but eventually, rates will decrease because there\u2019s more users to distribute awards to. And when that happens, users leave.\n\nThe people who benefit from these trends are the people who made it in early, while people left holding the bag get rekt. While I don\u2019t see anything inherently wrong with this\u2014I mean, technically early birds should get the most rewards since they\u2019re the ones who took most of the risks\u2014protocols and users who are late to the party are at the mercy of these nomadic farmers who come and go. Most protocols end up being in no-man\u2019s land after a few months and users always have to be on the move.\n\nSticking to the theme of Defi user being farmers, Defi is currently at an era of nomadic pastoralism and needs to adopt sustainable agriculture practices.\n\nSilver Lining\n\nDefi is young and rapidly changing. Developers and users are aware of the problems and innovation is always seeking to find solutions.\n\nThere\u2019s a movement in the space referred to as Defi 2.0, which revamps the current model in a way that still makes Defi fair and decentralized, while also making protocols less reliant on users who come and go.\n\nIt\u2019s also getting easier to use and a bunch of protocols are being created to broaden the spectrum for those who prefer to have more security (of course, at the expense of trade offs in rewards).\n\nWhen in doubt, zoom out. And looking at the world of Defi as we know it today, It\u2019s really only just been 2-3 years. Since then, the Defi ecosystem has grown to an estimated $250B + in total value locked. Imagine what it can accomplish in the next few years.",

            "text": "What follows is not financial advice, quite the opposite.  DYOR is a way of life, an edge for those of us who really practice it.  Smart vs. dumb money isn't professional vs. retail as is often cast (by pros), but DYOR vs. mindless trend follower.  I'm proud of how often these past few years retail has done better research than the so-called pros.  So below you'll see some opinion that's not verifiable, you'll just have to weigh it yourself and you'll see references to adoption and stats that can be verified with your favorite search engine or hard work staring at charts.  DYOR or don't, your call.  \n\nAt this and other accounts over the past five years I've come across many of the same questions over and over again, so I'm going to recount the most popular ones here.  The TL;DR is the title.  Litecoin is deep clucking value.  If you want more than that, you have some reading to do, though I will bold a few important parts.  \n\n**Q.** Isn't Litecoin dead?  \n**A.** Litecoin as a network is more alive than ever.  On chain transactions, active addresses and volume have thrived relative to the market through bear markets and bull.  Recent stats from Bitpay confirm what can be seen onchain, Litecoin remains one of the most popular altcoins to use.  In just three months after being added, Litecoin beat every altcoin on Bitpay including those that had a 4 year head start to build up their userbase there.  If anyone had told you that would happen, you would have snorted Pepsi through your nose in laughter.  It should tell you something about your priors that it did happen.  \n\n**Q.** How can Litecoin still matter since it's no different than any other low fee currency coin?  \n**A.** It's all about the fundamentals.  Lots of coins have some element in common with Litecoin or another, but not one, not even bitcoin, has them all.  The whole is greater than the sum of the parts which is why Litecoin celebrated an 10 year birthday with 100% up time, something no other relevant altcoin has ever done.  It's why it's forgotten more crypto winters than most coins will ever see.  No matter how many times it's declared dead, just like it's big brother, Litecoin will never stop.  \n\n**Q.** Wait a second, there are no fundamentals in crypto.  CNBC said so.  \n**A.** Fundamentals don't drive everything in any market, obviously.  And yes, a very large percentage of cryptos are driven entirely by hype, a different set every cycle.  There has to be a new set of pure hype cryptos every cycle because those almost never survive the crypto winter (the one exception is telling, Litecoin's little brother Doge sheltered from the cryptowinter by merged mining with LTC).  The Bitcoin killers came in the first cycle.  In the next cycle there were mostly ICO non-native tokens.  This cycle there are the Ethereum killers and meme tokens.  \n\nBut fundamentals are vital to the big three, Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum.  And the key fundamental is network effect.  If you read nothing else today and even if you'll never care about Litecoin, lock in on this truism: Network effect can't be gitcloned.  The longer infrastructure and social norms takes to build, the more expensive the cost of it, the harder it is to tear down.  Hype based coins fade to nothing when the hype fades, tech based coins can have their tech gitcloned by anyone.  Infrastructure based coins keep coming back over and over.    \n\n**Q.** You can't possibly be comparing LTC with BTC and ETH\u2026  \n**A.**  That's the league.  4th place isn't even close.  In this space, eth is the smart contracts winner, bitcoin is the store of value winner and Litecoin is the medium of transaction winner.  The real mind blower for a lot of people who desperately want to hate on everything but their favorite coin is that none of these coins compete with each other.  Nor should they try.  As interoperability grows through second layers, this triad will endure not only longer than 99.9% of other cryptos, but longer than most fiat currencies as well, maybe even longer than all of them.  \n\n**Q.** If Litecoin is elite how come I haven't heard anything about it in years?  \n**A. Just in recent times, Litecoin has added Paypal, Venmo, Bitpay, Verifone, AMC, Newegg, Interactive Brokers among others and Grayscale announced they're eager to move the popular LTCN trust into a spot ETF as soon as the SEC will allow.  On the development front Omnilite was launched in September, MWEB is finishing up a multiyear development phase with audits and revisions and taproot is on deck.  Litecoin progress is so common, it's not even newsworthy anymore.  Rain is wet, Litecoin is growing, story at 11.**  \n\nThere are, of course, competing coin communities that try to shape news stories to exclude the word Litecoin.  Post a thread in the cryptocurrency sub with the word Litecoin in the title, the downvotes come fast and furious (certain times of day, they come even faster).  Post the same story, about say, AMC adding several cryptos and exclude the word Litecoin, and the reaction is far more positive.  So by aggressively downvoting LTC material, other posters even with no dog in the fight, are incentivized to leave out the constantly present Litecoin from their posts, and many people who aren't looking beyond the headlines don't realize Litecoin is in so many of them.  \n\n**Q.** Let's go back, you said no other coin had all of Litecoin's elements, what blend sets it apart?  \n**A.** Litecoin's major advantage is network effect, in two parts.  The first part is infrastructure.  Network effects consist of all users, not just people.  Exchanges, payment processors, retailers, software, ATMs, far flung b2b cross border payments in regions with limited/no access to secure, affordable financial services, OTC desks, trusts, ETFs, everything that can be built is part of network effect, and the more it costs to build it, the more durable it tends to be.  Much infrastructure slapped up around new coins today is cheaply gotten and will be quickly lost when hype fades.  \n\nAs an aside, something no one here will believe or understand, Litecoin's most important user is Bitcoin.  More on this is another question.  Not Bitcoiners, the people, though the close cultural/development relationship between LTC and BTC helps, but bitcoin the network is a user of Litecoin.  This is a huge part of how Litecoin has thrived all these years and built up so much other antifragile infrastructure.  \n\nThe second part of network effect is more obvious, actual people.  All of those infrastructure elements rely on the more  users to maintain them.  If there isn't constant liquidity and volume in good times and bad, as many who've been here through multiple cycles know, coins get delisted and removed.  Many removed coins needed to only provide liquidity to a tiny number of exchanges and still fail.  Litecoin has provided liquidity and volume enough for virtually every exchange, payment processor and other element out there, and has done so consistently over ten years.  The network effect has grown far beyond what second tier alts can fathom.  \n\nLitecoin's minor advantages are more feature based, and many are boring, but also vital to its success.  Quickly, yes, Litecoin is low fee separating it from both Ethereum and Bitcoin.  But it also has world class security in the form of multigenerationally evolved ASICs that are globally distributed on an algo Litecoin is superdominant on, separating it from most other altcoins.  Additionally Litecoin's fair launch, fairly mined status along with its lack of a founder stash separate it massively from the new hype coins which are heavily centralized, and centralization is risk.  \n\nLitecoin's subcent fees are not unique among alts.  It's security and network effect including constant liquidity and healthy volume is not unique among the top three, BTC, LTC, ETH.  Its decentralization is not unique among the top two, BTC is on par.  **But when you piece it all together you have with Litecoin a network unlike any other.**  \n\n**Q.** Ok, time to get back to that weird aside, how can bitcoin as a network be a user of the Litecoin network?  \n**A.**  Yes, **Bitcoin is Litecoin's most important user**.  This happens in several ways and the relationship is growing more intertwined as second layers continue to evolve.  \n\nDevelopment synergy has been a big part of this.  Litecoin has in the past been called a testnet for bitcoin.  This was often used as a derogatory term, as testnet coins are valueless.  **The very real advantage that Litecoin offered bitcoin was as a test market, one which not only roughly tested basic functionality of tech as a testnet does, but also tested how market participants, both white hat and black hat, reacted to it.**  You can't really test security on a testnet because the bad guys aren't incentivized to try and break through the security, there's no payoff.  You can't test regulatory reactions or infrastructure partners or a many others because most don't know or care what testnets are.  The only way to see how a real market will really react is to bring the tech to real market participants on a large scale.  Because of Litecoin's constant use and broad infrastructure support, as well as its codebase being kept very close to bitcoin's, it's the perfect test market.  \n\nWhat many don't realize is that the synergy goes both ways.  Litecoin actually has 100% uptime while Bitcoin is in the 99.98% range because while Litecoin tends to test rare controversial upgrades, like Segwit/lightning and MWEB, on Bitcoin's behalf, Bitcoin is testing all the non-controversial updates for Litecoin, like, most recently, taproot.  So Litecoin uses Bitcoin too.  \n\nThe block wars of 2017 are instructive in how this all works.  Big blockers did everything they could to stop segwit from activating, and heavily delayed it long after everyone capable of understanding the tech (even its detractors) realized it was perfectly safe and useful.  In early 2017, Charlie Lee stepped up and said Litecoin would activate it first, plow the road to prove it up.  Along the way alongside bitcoin allies, the Litecoin community helped develop the winning strategy that got bitcoin through activation later that year, the UASF.  Litecoin didn't used the UASF, but the billionaire mining consortium that was blocking progress didn't fold until Charlie came out publicly in favor of it, and that folding told everyone everything they needed to know about how to defeat the big blockers.  \n\nAfter activation, Charlie put $1 million of his own money into a segwit address and dared big blockers to steal it.  Old timers might understand why, but if you've come around more recently, that fud at that time coming from people who 100% knew it wasn't true, was that any value stored in a segwit address could be stolen, it wasn't safe.  This helped paralyze the market and prevent activation.  Once Charlie put the million dollar segwit bounty up and it went untouched, the fud died so hard that most now don't even remember it was a thing.  More about Charlie later, but this is the moment he earned most of his enemies, and just as they lied viciously to stop lightning adoption then, they lied viciously about him to get revenge after he was so instrumental in helping Bitcoin through that civil war.  \n\nOf, course, the Litecoin community wasn't being purely selfless by adopting segwit and lightning, something that people then and even many still today fear would obviate the need for faster cheaper altcoins.  Litecoin has understood very early on that the most impressive feature of lightning was not fast cheap offchain transactions, but cross chain transactions.  When I said Bitcoin would use Litecoin even more in the future than in the past, this is what I meant.  \n\n**In the future I believe Bitcoin and Litecoin will flow seamlessly and constantly across the lightning network and mutually reinforce each other's security.  I believe coffee is not an endgame for lightning, it's just how to get the liquidity kickstarted.  In the future I believe the entire world will touch lightning every day, most without realizing it, and that layer will be their most frequent interaction with the underlying networks.  In that scenario, in order to attack the lightning backbone and either take it down or spam it, you'd have to simultaneously take on both the underlying bitcoin and Litecoin networks, thus mutual reinforcement.  If only one fails, traffic can temporarily divert final settlement to the other chain until the downed chain returns.  The cost of such an attack, both in dollars and logistical complications will further discourage any attack from ever taking place.**  \n\nYes, Bitcoin is the most important user of Litecoin.  In the early days people often used Litecoin as a quick arbitrage coin to move value between exchanges and save fees.  This was but a shadow of things to come.  Combined with Litecoin's other redeeming qualities discussed in several questions above, it's closeness to bitcoin in code and culture have made it silver to bitcoin's gold in more ways than most will ever acknowledge.  But in addition to some market based behaviours that are similar between silver and gold such as price oscillation, remember that Litecoin is also robin to bitcoin's batman, Daniel-san to Bitcoin's Miyagi, Pippen to Bitcoin's Jordan and a wink to Bitcoin's smile.  Litecoin has outlasted untold bitcoin killers precisely because it never even tried to compete with bitcoin, but to help it, and in the process it has carved out its own lane to dominate and thrive with a little help from its most important user, Bitcoin.  \n\nAs a result of this longstanding and growing affiliation, software and infrastructure that is quick to add bitcoin is usually pretty quick to add Litecoin.  And then users who are friendly to bitcoin are more friendly to Litecoin, ensuring enough volume and liquidity to maintain that infrastructure over time.  \n\n**Q.** If Charlie dumped all his Litecoins, why would I want to hold them?  \n**A.** Often the implication of people who drop in to say the founder of Litecoin dumped his coins want to leave you with the impression that he left the project without actually having to lie and say that.  He not only didn't leave, he's been more active and more successful at helping Litecoin build adoption and infrastructure than he was before he divested.  \n\nHe still uses Litecoin at every opportunity, including to make purchases to donate to Litecoin development.  In the recent multiyear MWEB development rollout, funded entirely by community donations, Charlie personally matched every donation made.  He's donated to other causes as well for both adoption and development and is almost certainly the largest donor so far, though other large donors like Ryan Wright are starting to step up as well.  \n\nCharlie was being harassed before he divested with every Litecoin news item he posted accusing him of pumping and dumping on hype.  Tons of founders and ICO scam artists were doing exactly that at the time, and Charlie figured that by divesting, he could assure everyone that his efforts and posts were to build Litecoin up rather than trying to profit off pumps and dumps.  He underestimated the trolls, mostly big blockers back then, who then made his divestment their new favorite talking point, trying to make people think he'd abandoned the project.  \n\nBut in the course of divesting I think mostly for that reason, he accomplished something far more important that I alluded to in an earlier question.  Litecoin now has no founder's stash, an element of decentralization that sets it apart from even the king of decentralization, Bitcoin.  In many ways, Charlie has mirrored what Satoshi did when he actually stepped away from the project, abandoning bitcoin.  Satoshi left and kept his coins.  Charlie stayed and divested.  \n\nI would imagine in the end both bitcoin and Litecoin will end up equal on these fronts, that eventually Charlie will move on, as a coin founder of a decentralized, public blockchain should, and that Satoshi's coins will be circulated as well, so neither will have either a founder's stash nor an active founder leading the community.  For now, whatever his motivation, I find Litecoin more appealing for its lack of a founder's stash.  \n\n**Q.**  So you think Charlie is a saint or something?  \n**A.**  Nah, he's a pretty normal, chill dude.  As human as anyone, just trying to figure things out as he goes.  Not unlike Satoshi.  I think Charlie's instincts are far more appropriate to a truly decentralized space than most coin founder who do act like CEOs even though they claim to control a decentralized blockchain rather than a centralized security/company.  \n\nI think it would surprise most to hear that Charlie has said repeatedly he made more money out of bitcoin than Litecoin.  It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.  He founded Litecoin in 2011, just two years after bitcoin launched, and he was obviously into bitcoin before that.  He had a similar experience to many of us, bought some when people were talking about, and it went down after, but for anyone who got in then and stayed, I mean of course he made a fortune on bitcoin.  And since Litecoin was fairly launched and he was just one miner alongside everyone else who at the time was eager for a coin to mine with lesser hardware than bitcoin by then required, his stash was never the size of Satoshi's, much less of these huge premined, ICO'd, centralized coin launches that are more common today.  \n\nI especially think the hate around him is based on transparent lies.  Don't believe me, DYOR.  Step past the trolls for a bit and get to know him yourself.  He's soft-spoken, the worst hype-master ever (my highest compliment for anyone), nice, and a constant advocate for bitcoin as well as Litecoin, something very in sync with the Litecoin community as a whole.  We're all Bitcoiners in addition to being Litecoiners.  \n\n**Q.** Doesn't Litecoin's success just comes from it being old?  \n**A.** Many old coins died out.  Litecoin isn't even the oldest, it's just the oldest that has thrived.  It thrived for many of the reasons that have already been laid out.  The high marks on decentralization helped, the close, affectionate relationship with bitcoin helped, the low fees combined with deep and broad security helped, and yes, time helped too.  \n\nBut it's not \"just\" old.  **Litecoin got old and outlived so many failed projects because it made so many right choices along the way.**  \n\n**Q.** If Litecoin is so great, why is the price so low?  \n**A.** Ah, yes, well, fundamentals are\u2026fun, but of course price matters.  Litecoin wouldn't be deep clucking value if there weren't appreciation in its future.  \n\nThat's the first thing you have to think about here.  Do you want to hop on board a project that already has most of its price appreciation in the past, or one that still has most of it's price appreciation ahead of it.  Trend following does pay off for some people, but probably not as many as you think.  I've seen trend followers lose money in every kind of market.  Even in raging bull markets they fomo in at the top, panic sell the bottom of the next move, then buy back in even higher than first time, multiplying losses over time.  And even if a trend follower gets in before the end of crypto's often accelerated trends, they are often more quiet about how much they lose on the trends that end right when the jump in.  \n\n**Litecoin is an amazing trading coin precisely because it has predictability.**  You don't have to wonder whether it's cheap or expensive, it has the most established ratio price history of any coin against bitcoin, and for that matter, the most usefully established history against eth as well.  Both ratios are extremely useful trading pairs (even if you to do a multihop trade on an exchange that doesn't have the pair directly) against Litecoin.  \n\nSince this is a proDYOR post, I'm not going to tell you where the cheap ratios and expensive ratios are.  But the good news is, it's really, really easy to find on the chart.  The trend followers would look at a ltcbtc or ltceth chart and jump on anything but ltc.  A deep value investor will zoom out and look at what happened when litecoin was in a similar position in previous cycles.  \n\n**Q.** C'mon.  BTC has exceeded 3x its 2017 ATH, ETH has done similar.  You have to admit LTC has failed is now going to fade to nothing.  \n**A.** Litecoin's lagging price is a feature, not a bug, and it's not new.  Litecoin tends to price in progress all at once.  The benefit of that is that you have much longer, cheaper accumulation periods than with coins that price in more gradually where each buy is more expensive than the last.  \n\nHere's the fiat price pattern to look for.  Litecoin leads all coins, even bitcoin, out of crypto winter.  It did 7x in 2015, 6x in 2019 (probably could've gotten higher but Novogratz bandwagoned a short campaign against it as it led the recovery rally, he failed and I wouldn't be surprised if he lost money on the bounce, but did put a little dent in highs).  Then Litecoin hibernates around 18 months while other coins take off in succession, first bitcoin, then eth, then lots of others.  In spring of 2017 and spring of 2021, Litecoin was off to the races in almost a perfect reflection of past price action, and most of you know what happened next.  Maypocolypse affected some coins more than others, those that finished a rally well above their old ATHs before that date fared much better than those that were just cycling up for their run.  \n\nHad maypocolypse happened in august instead, Litecoin likely would have reached $1000 before crashing back down to $400 or so, just as in 2017 it reached $100 before crashing back around the old 2013 high, and then set up for another year end rally to finish off in fine fashion.  \n\nNow you can look at that maypocolypse price action and find your bias confirmed if you please.  But I think the more clever and studious will see an even more extended opportunity to buy Litecoin cheap than exists in even a standard cycle.  Bouyed by fundamentals and with long term price action far more visible than on newer, flimsier projects, Litecoin shows a base of epic proportions.  \n\nThose of us who've had success trading litecoin have used it as an oscillator.  When Litecoin is strong against bitcoin or eth, as it was dominating them in 2019, that's a good time to use your Litecoin to buy bitcoin or eth.  When Litecoin is weak against them, as it is now, it's a great time to use eth and btc to buy Litecoin.  Look at the charts yourself.  It's a killer trade with incredible intelligence about what \"strong\" and \"weak\" mean buried everywhere in the long term price action.  \n\nAnyone ever hear the phrase, \"the longer the base, the higher in space?\"  We're about to find out if it's true.  I can't think of a better test case than Litecoin given all the substance it has under the surface.  This is the ultimate all cattle, no hat crypto, and even if all you want to do is check and see if substance matters, if hype is the only thing real in crypto as the nocoiners believe, watch Litecoin.  It's the proof in the pudding.  Deep Clucking Value.  \n\n**Q.**  Why is the value\u2026 clucking?  Are you having a stroke?  \n**A. The longtime mascot of Litecoin is the Chicken**, normally spelled chikun for the normal memey reasons.  The chikun is the mainstay of litecoin gifs and posts.  I've been known to respond to fudsters with a hearty \"yipeekiyay mothercluckers\", myself.  That one hasn't really taken off, but I'm trying to get it going.  \n\n**Q.** TL;DR?  \n**A. Litecoin is Deep Clucking Value.**",

I just wish it was easier to transfer between my bank. Pretty decent list of coins and you can lock them away to collect earn and prevent panic selling.\n\nThe crypto earn doesn\u2019t compound, interest goes into your trading account and is too small an amount to stake on its own, so it sits idle until it\u2019s time to restake.\n\nI\u2019ve also used Coinbase, Gemini, and BlockFi (which is for holding not trading).\n\nCoinbase and Gemini both eat away at profits with fees. \n\nCoinbase Pro should solve that issue, but I haven\u2019t used it yet. It cuts fees dramatically and works more like a stock exchange with the ability to set orders for specific prices. \n\n(EDIT: u/BeneficialFly5857 pointed out that Gemini Active Trader doesn\u2019t have those fees, but it is browser based.)\n\nIf I were to try day trading crypto that\u2019s *probably* where I\u2019d do it? That or just use a stock broker. They mostly work in IOUs but if you\u2019re day trading that seems fine.\n\nGemini is the Winkelvoss exchange so if name recognition is a thing there\u2019s that. They can take a while pulling your crypto from Earn to your Trading account -  sometimes days - but it\u2019s not totally locked like Crypto.com. Earn pays out and compounds daily.\n\nBlockFi is great for a crypto savings account. I have some in stablecoins collecting 8-10%. You aren\u2019t locked at all, but they pay out monthly.\n\nI\u2019ve tried and been unable to verify myself on Celsius and Binance, although the latter eventually worked but by then I saw no reason to actually use it. \n\nThe Celsius app doesn\u2019t have a button to take the photo of my license for some reason and I am so confused. There\u2019s one on the \u201cnational ID\u201d page\u2026 probably me doing something wrong with an ad blocker or VPN?\n\nI have also used the Crypto.com and Coinbase debit cards. The red crypto card gets you \u201cfree\u201d Spotify and the $400 worth of CRO I had to stake went up nicely to $700 but that\u2019s obviously not guaranteed. \n\nIt\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d because they reimburse you an equivalent amount of CRO, and then you have to top up your debit card.\n\nCoinbase makes it real easy to just buy USDC funded straight from your bank and you don\u2019t have to top up the card. I bought tacos the other day with it and it was pretty neat.\n\nBlockFi has a Visa credit card that gives Bitcoin with use and increases the interest return on your coins.. I haven\u2019t tried it.",

We are comparing crypto investments and he's pointed out to me that typically, the best crypto projects that offer the most gains over time are smart contract platforms. Looking at the top 10 cryptos by market cap I can see that they are indeed nearly all composed of smart contract platforms (Ethereum, Solana, polkadot, etc). This would lead me to believe that if there were two hypothetical coins, and they both launched at the same time, and one of them was a single company while the other was a smart contract platform, the smart contract platform would have a better chance of gaining more over the next few years. What are your thoughts on this? Cheers",

            "text": "There's quite a bit of misconception about what staking actually does to a cryptoasset. Apparently, nearly everyone on a specific popular sub thinks it's free compounding interest (See top comments in [1](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qy4hzw/is_staking_really_worth_it/) and [2](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qy7qjh/yes_staking_is_really_worth_it/)). While it is true that staking is better not staking, it is very misleading to assume that a staker's Purchasing Power will increase equally to the advertised APY.\n\n**TL;DR: What they don't realize is that staking is actually a form of supply redistribution from non-stakers to stakers. Without any external factors, the total value of a network remains constant. Anyone who doesn't stake will generally lose Purchasing Power (PP) while anyone who does stake will generally gain PP, but at a lower rate than the advertised APY. The higher the percentage of coins staked, the lower the true interest rate received by stakers. Nearly all staking rewards are paid out from either:**\n\n* 1) Monetary inflation (aka supply inflation)\n* 2) A pre-mined rewards pool.\n\nIn additional, staking rewards are also paid for the risk of securing the network. Some networks like Ethereum slash rewards for stakers who make mistakes when validating while others like Cardano pay less rewards for mistakes and unavailability.\n\nAlso, staking should not to be confused with earning rewards from lending out cryptoassets on platforms like BlockFi and Gemini, which are rewards paid for the risk of lending. There is currently so much price-volatility for cryptoassets that it basically masks the inflationary effect of staking. No one's going to notice a 5% yearly change when a cryptoasset changes that much in price weekly.\n\n(Nearly all decentralized cryptoassets with staking rewards behave this way. There are a few centralized exceptions, one of which is Celsius Network's token. Because Celsius is a centralized authority and collects revenue through lending, they are able to buy back directly from the market supply for their token.)\n\n-----\n\n**Let's looks at an example:**\n\nAssume that there exists a theoretical stablecoin tied to the price of an Apple. The overall total Purchasing Power (PP) of the whole network does not change. We can use an algorithmically-determined stablecoin with a rebasing model like Ampleforth. Due to the rebasing model, the total supply of coins changes dynamically so that the total value of all coins remains constant. (For simplicity, we will also assume perfect network efficiency and zero infrastructure cost.)\n\n**Anyone who doesn't stake will lose Purchasing Power (PP) in Apples while anyone who does stake will gain PP, but at a lower rate than the advertised APY. The true APY stakers earn is inversely proportional to the total fraction of coins staked.**\n\nIn this example, everyone starts with 100 coins equal to 100 Apples, staking is at 10% APY, and the fraction of the total cryptoassets that are staked is **y**.\n\n|Initial Apples|APY|Fraction staked|Final Apples for stakers|Final Apples for non-stakers|\n:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|P Coins|x|y|P * (1+x) / [y * (1+x) + (1-y)]|P * / [y * (1+x) + (1-y)]|\n|100|10%|0%|-|100|\n|100|10%|25%|107|98|\n|100|10%|50%|105|95|\n|100|10%|75%|102|93|\n|100|10%|100%|100|-\u200b|\n\n* If 50% of the coins are staked, after 1 year, stakers will have ~105 Apples of PP while non-stakers will have ~95 Apples of PP.\n* If everyone stakes, everyone will end up with exactly 100 Apples of value.\n* If no one stakes, everyone will end up with exactly 100 Apples of value.",

            "text": "Cryptocurrency subreddit won't let me share my anecdote even though they have a flair called anecdote and a bunch of anecdote posts using the anecdote flair doing the same thing I'm doing. Hypocrites. Anyways. I'll guess it post it here as \"humor\". But this isn't funny.\n\nI started investing 6 months ago. I made about $5000 off of AMC in a matter of weeks. I didn't realize I was supposed to pull out though and got her pregnant. She took my $5000 and another $7000 on top of that. Ever since that day, I quit stocks and decided to play with crypto. All I did was make money off Ethereum and Litecoin for the next 5 months. Every time I was up enough I pulled out. No more risks. Waited for the dip. And bought back in. Everything was going swimmingly. I'm only 4k way from a full recovery.\n\nThen October came around. Rumors of parabolic rises. I watched a ton of alt coins go to the moon and I sat by watching them though a telescope. But I decided it's time to learn the game. So I invested in Zombie Inu. The gas fees combined with the tokenomic tax was treacherous. Even had a failed transaction the first time around because I set too low a slippage...and found out it still charges you. I wanted to make my money back so bad, I recorded the first half of a song I wrote to the coin. So I could try to pump it myself. Luckily I didn't have to release it and ruin my brand because the coin went up by itself. I eventually doubled my money and pulled out. No more pregnancies on my watch. I was only 2.5k away from having a positive investing career. I converted back to Ethereum and let it sit in my metamask in case I was feeling lucky again. But I said...nah...lemme just play it safe. Ethereum is about to rage and all I have to do is sit still. But...you know what? I learned a lot investing in that token with metamask and uniswap...how about I start playing with NFT's?\n\nI wasn't about to buy one though...too risky...I wouldn't know where to start! But how about I make them instead? I went to Rarible and found out I could mint without even paying. I could let the buyer mint instead. Perfect. There's literally nothing to lose. So get this. I sharpened a pencil...the shaving came out in a a triangle shape...I flip it over so that the yellow part of the shaving is the hair...and I draw a face on it with a pencil. Enter PencilHeadz.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/KFkCgnK](https://imgur.com/a/KFkCgnK)\n\nHilarious right? Absolutely stupid. Boredom at its prime. See I wasn't like \"YO I'M ABOUT TO GRAB THE METAVERSE BY IT'S BALLS\". I was cooling. Shoot I'll make a backstory while I'm at it. I'm a 12 year old boy in school taking pictures of his pencil shavings, an art prodigy. So good but so unaware of how good I am and humble when the world comes to sit in my palm because I don't even understand the concept of work and money yet!\n\nBut that's not how it went. Not even a little. Because on RARIBLE, when you edit a preference, it makes you sign in your Metamask. Basically you just hit ok. So I edited the title, hit ok in my metamask. Edited the token symbol, hit ok. Made the title of the collection \"PencilHeadz\" hit ok. Except hold up...did I just see something about a gas fee? I opened my MetaMask again to see what I just clicked and it says PENDING, $2039 DOLLARS. I SAID EXCUSE ME METAMASK??? IT REPEATED ITSELF, \"$2039 IS ABOUT TO DISAPPEAR FROM YOUR ACCOUNT IN T-10, ENJOY LOSER\". I'M LIKE CANCEL HOW CANCEL CLICK TWIST KNOB OPEN DOOR CANCEL CANCEL CANCEL. But of course it didn't cancel. It took like 15 seconds. It's funny because when I tried buying a dip on uniswap it took 3 minutes. But of course when I'm throwing my money in a dumpster, it's immediate and efficient.\n\nAt this point I threw my headphones and slammed by computer shut because I do NOT have that kind of money, I've never had that kind of money. That was literally the most expensive thing I ever bought and I didn't even know what it was at the time. That plus the down trend we're currently in took me so far away from all the work I did in the last 5 months that I still can't believe it. When I finally cooled down and realized it's most likely impossible to get a refund, I did some research and found out I just minted a collection...didn't even mint a pic yet...just minted the collection...and apparently it's the most expensive gas fee on the entire Web 3.0. Why. How. Who even? Idk. I don't even care. Except I do though. Because I just spent\n\ntwo thousand dollars\n\non pencil shavings.\n\non. shavings. of. a pencil.\n\nMy friend literally calls me pencilhead now\n\nMy girlfriend said she has a surprise for me. She opens her palm and it was a pencil shaving\n\nI'm crying typing this\n\nI was gonna be the cool 12 year old nft Banksy.\n\nNow I'm just a 29 year old \\*\\*\\*\\* up\n\nsomebody kill me",

            "text": "Some say they are the next step in the evolution of society and business: The **D**ecentralized **A**utonomous **O**rganizations (DAOs). Groups of people from all over the world are starting to organize themselves using distributed ledger technologies (DLT), such as blockchains, DAGs and smart contracts, in order to start decentralized businesses, investment groups, charity movements or social clubs.\n\nDAOs come in all shapes and forms and they differ widely in their goals, inner structures and legal frameworks. However, they all share a promise to combine individual freedom and economic opportunities with community and a sense shared values. Modern DLTs enable DAOs to transparently manage shared crypto-wallets and to perform democratic votes\u200a\u2014\u200aeven in permissionless, highly fluctuating and often times anonymous groups of people.\n\nCurrently, most DAOs run on blockchains like Ethereum or xDAI. But now a new platform is entering the conversation: IOTA with its new IOTA smart contracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How could the future of IOTAs DAO-ecosystem look like?**\n\n**Vision I: The DAO-landscape will be pluralistic**\n\nPeople will organize themselves to accomplish many different kinds of tasks\u200a\u2014\u200afrom business and investments to charity and social activities. They will vary greatly in structure, size and goals and therefore there will not be \u201cone DAO to rule them all\u201d. Let\u00b4s first have a look into what kinds of DAOs already exist in other ecosystems as of today\u200a\u2014\u200aand exchange some ideas on how equivalents in IOTAs ecosystem could look like. This is by no means intended to be a exhaustive review of the vast DAO-landscapes out there, but rather a gentle primer to start to get into the topic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Types of DAOs\u200a\u2014\u200aan overview (find a more complete discussion** [**here**](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw)**)** \n\n**Service DAOs**\n\nService DAOs can range from collectives of freelancers to fully decentralized companies that offer services against payments.\n\n**Examples:** Legal advice ([Lex DAO](https://www.lexdao.coop/)) **Ideas:** IOTA developers DAO, Decentralized social media ([Society2](https://society2.com/))\n\n**Funding DAOs**\n\nFunding DAOs aim to further some agreed-upon cause by giving money to promising projects and ventures.\n\n**Examples:** Uniswap grants, AAVE grants **Ideas:** Charity DAOs, IOTA research grants, IOTA content creator fund\n\n**Investment DAOs**\n\nInvestment DAOs aim at investing money for future returns. Investments can go into start-ups, stocks, digital assets or anything else that is seen as promising to return increased monetary value.\n\n**Examples**: [Meta Cartel](https://www.metacartel.org/), The [LAO](https://docs.thelao.io/) **Ideas**: IOTA start-up funding, Crypto-ETFs\n\n**Social DAOs**\n\nSocial DAOs use decentralized governance structures in order to organize communities (and shared funds).\n\n**Examples:** [Seed club](https://seedclub.io/), [Friends-with-benefits](https://medium.com/friends-with-benefits/introducing-fwb-pro-313d62183678) **Ideas:** \\#Spec DAO, Political parties, gaming guilds\n\n**Protocol DAOs**\n\nProtocol DAOs decentralize code development, introduce voting into coding decisions and help financing open-source technology.\n\n**Examples:** Sushi, [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) **Ideas:** IOTA Foundation as a DAO\n\n**Super-DAOs**\n\nA DAO that mainly funds other DAOs. Can have a very broad vision, with its details expressed in sub-DAOs (each with smaller, but more specialized and dedicated communities).\n\n**Ideas:** IOTA Treasury DAO, Community-housing DAO\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vision II: DAOs will interact with one another**\n\nDAOs can feel like little universes on their own with lively discussions, their own tokenomics, governance structures, voting systems,developments and plans for the future.\n\nYet, DAOs will not be isolated islands. As the ecosystem matures we will see fluid and complex interactions between all kinds of DAOs. An investment DAO for example might pay developers from a service DAO in order to implement new features. At the same time it might manage funds from several other DAOs that want to diversify their own holdings. And if it has a social component in its vision, it might even pay some of its profits back to environmental or charity DAOs too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 1: DAOs will interact with one another. Here, a super-DAO interacts with all kinds of different DAOs in order to buy services, fund developments and to diversify its own funds.](https://i.redd.it/a1vbo82qcqz71.gif)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vision III: DAOs will interact with the non-DAO world**\n\nAs we can see, a fully grown DAO ecosystem already gives room for quite complex economic and social landscapes. However, the decentralized world will not live in a vacuum. Not all social and economic activities can be implemented online in the form of DAOs and so even in the furthest vision of a future decentralized society, there will still be plenty of non-DAO entities around, that will also interact with DAOs. These entities too will buy services, invest, donate and fund all kinds of decentralized organizations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 2: All kinds of DAOs interact with the outside, non-DAO world in one way or another, be it through providing paid services, funds that want to be invested or by social activities.](https://i.redd.it/kx9272iscqz71.gif)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vision IV: Interactions will be fluid, democratic and follow free-market principles**\n\nJust like, and possibly even more so than, current economies, the DAO eco-system will not create static and ever-repeating forms of interactions. Instead, a free market of ideas and services will flourish, with changing opinions, majorities and needs and therefore always changing connections and new areas of growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 3: An attempt to visualize the full picture. All DAOs and the outside world will show highly fluent interactions with one another, always driven by free-market mechanisms and democratic change in opinions.](https://i.redd.it/dhxrlvvucqz71.gif)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cambrian explosion of IOTA DAOs soon**\n\nWith the start of IOTA smart contracts on the IOTA mainnet in probably a few months the community will experience a large burst in ecosystem development including the emergence of a plethora of DAOs. In fact, even as of today first pioneers in the IOTA ecosystem connect with each other in order to conceptualize and even build the first DAOs of this new era. It is on us, the community, to shape this next level of the IOTA ecosystem in ways that we seem fit. For this, we need to share our ideas, connect with each other and educate ourselves about available technologies and possibilities.\n\n**Let\u00b4s build some DAOs together!**\n\nIf you want to learn more about DAOs I recommend to you joining the IOTA DAO-pioneers on the IOTA Discord. They share a large and well organized collection of learning materials and hold regular meetings for connection and discussion with others. See you there!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If you like my articles please consider to leave a tip. Thanks a lot**\n\niota1qzugnaga5pj3hwztrht0lx8qf6w0mkrc2flcq98ekmpq2xerc9sey35j5fj",

Full speed ahead!\n\nBut I want to understand it really well, so here are my questions, any help is welcome!\n\n1. Will the community tokens be available to **trade and sell at outside exchanges**? since they will be on ethereum, we should be able to trade anywhere?\n2. Are the **tokens breakable into decimal numbers**? e.g. 0.001 moon; for example, we can break down 1 BTC into 100,000,000 parts, will this be the same for the community tokens?\n3. I read on the vault page that coins will be burned everytime someone purchases them with dollars. This is great! good deflationary tactic. But the **exact metric of how much is burned** will be nice to know.\n4. I read the max number of tokens will be 250 million, is that for **all tokens across ALL subreddits** or **250 million for each subreddit** that gets tokenized? I hope it is the latter, because then there will be less competition across subreddits.\n\nA link to something like a whitepaper or some helpful articles will be highly appreciated, I know this is an early stage, but I am extremely happy about this feature and would love to become a beneficiary of this tech.

            "text": "&#x200B;\n\nYield Farming is a very well-known strategy used by DeFi users to earn higher interest in their cryptocurrencies. Yield farming projects come in a wide variety of options offering financial services, with the main aim to earn huge interests.\n\nIf we talk about keeping our money in the bank, the interest rate on that is very low as compared to the 20% to 200% coming from yield farming. But one thing I personally have learned over the years is that the risk potential is also higher. What are your thoughts on that?\n\nHere are some of the most preferred Yield Farming Apps for this year:\n\n**1. Uniswap**\n\nUnisawap has been holding its position as the 2nd largest DEX. It offers swapping of ETH and many more tokens as well as the option to stake in liquidity pools.\n\nThe interest rates on Uniswap and all other platforms vary from time to time based on the pool and also market fluctuations.\n\n**2. SmartCoin**\n\nSmartCoin is a yield farming, Paladin-audited protocol that is based on Avalanche (AVAX) with an advanced self-feeding tokenomics system that comes with a 100% fair launch. It has been the choice of investors for a long time now and continues to grow each day.\n\nThe main goal behind any such strategy is to offer a safe, stable, and profitable experience for those who relish the thrill of shooting for high APRs, while allocating a continuously increasing amount of SmartCoin every day to the community in a way of massive booster mechanics and economic stimulus incentives.\n\n**3. Aave**\n\nAave is a decentralized platform on Ethereum and also Polygon sidechain that offers its users low-interest borrowing of cryptocurrency and also lending. There are a lot of investors on this platform currently, that is why the interest rates are also better here. The total value locked in Aave is what makes it the King of these platforms.\n\nWhat are other amazing yield farming platforms that you are aware of?",

Lol, age and fan base is all they really have going for them. IMO it\u2019s a high cap meme coin with little potential (outside the inevitable pump during a bull market).",

I think people in the crypto space are very numb to price fluctuations.\r  \n\r  \nBitcoin is probably the safest cryptocurrency to invest in. The other extreme would be a shitcoin like \"BabyDoge\" or \"Fomo Baby\". These shitcoins have a right to exist, but they have no real use and should be seen for what they are: Gambling disguised as an investment.\r  \n\r  \nWhat you have to keep in mind with all financial matters is that the potential return only increases when the risk increases. There is no such thing as a risk-free and get-rich-quick strategy.\r  \n\r  \nSince my risk tolerance is practically non-existent, I would invest the $155 in promising altcoins. (altcoins are all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin). If you are interested I can introduce you to a few projects, however I don't want to influence you too much in your decisions. Doing your own research is still the best way to be 100% behind a project and makes it easier not to panic sell.\r  \n\r  \nIn general, I recommend you to take a closer look at the coins in the top 10 according to Marketcap to get a feeling for what crypto stands for and what's it all about.\r  \n\r  \nCrypto is still in its infancy and I believe that any investment in a reputable coin makes a lot of sense if you intend to hold your investment for a longer period of time.\r  \n\r  \nIf you want to dive a little deeper into the subject, I can recommend a few Youtubers (CoinBureau/CoinsKid and more). It is important to always look at both sides (bearish scenarios / bulliush scenarios) when doing research on a coin.\r  \n\r  \nOh and there are some unwritten rules you should follow:\r  \n\r  \n\\- Only invest money that you can lose without getting into trouble!\r  \n\\- Don't let FOMO kick in too hard\r  \n\\- Cryptocurrency trading addiction is a real thing. Be honest with your self and do something about it if you feel like you're losing control. Especially if you're the type of person thats prone to addiction.\r  \n\r  \nSorry for the long post. But im glad you are interested in crypto!\r  \n\r  \nAnd of course\r  \n\r  \n^(This is not financial advise. I'm just some random guy who is interested in crypto. :D)",

They enabled people to mint NFTs for free on their platforms and sell it later on the Ethereum mainnet. They acquired Hermez Rollups a while ago to boost their already high TPS and ensure extra privacy.\n\nI can keep going on for days but the post wouldn\u2019t end. Bottom line is, MATIC DESERVES THIS. They\u2019ve been restless the past couple months and honestly out of all other competition, they\u2019re doing the most right now. Stay bullish on MATIC guys.",

You should be familiar with what are dApps and DeFi blocks and blockchains\u2026 What fundamental value does this currency or that provide, etc.. You should gain more knowledge about the asset and the technology backing it, and based on that analysis you should take an investment call, and not based on what you read on a social media post.\n\nThe value of any cryptocurrency is derived from two factors: The hype which is the increase in demand due to social media and influencers, and that is generally short term. The other factor which is the main matter, the fundamental value that it provides. IF you observe and check, MATIC does provide a fundamental value to dApps developers, and is for sure one of the best performing crypto assets nowadays. \n\nUnquestionably, Polygon at present has the most number of agreements and deals in the crypto space. It is also well known for its determination on a wider mission ever since its rebranding and is proving how much reliable it can be especially with its superior suite of scalable solutions.\n\nPolygon is compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine, which developers can use to build their own dApps or easily port their apps to it. Polygon also offers technology to improve blockchain performance such as the sidechain, one of the first products it has provided. It is aiming to provide a framework for blockchain networks and grant the users the ability to create networks that interconnect with each other with all benefits provided including scalability, flexibility, and security. Another interesting point is that Polygon token is used for fees as they are paid with its currency, and is used for governance where you can help influence the future of the project by making and voting on proposals if you\u2019re holding tokens. You can also stake your tokens and let the network use them in exchange for interest. \n\nI believe MATIC is undervalued as I am sure that it is firmly trusted and will have a bright future. It will be the bridge between ecosystems! To whom is doubting, all I can tell you is impatient money will sooner or later go to patient hands.",

            "text": "  \n\n**TLDR**:\n\nWe can see that the Play-To-Earn trend is growing strongly, especially in the current market situation, both owning NFT (True Ownership) characters and valuable token rewards. , but can that happen in the long-term when the cash flow has already begun to \"stagnate\".\n\nWith the blockchain being widely recognised, it is possible that many large funds will start to participate in this game, the money may flow in the future & NFT Gaming projects are one of the most popular categories. The attraction and potential of Play To Earn projects are feasible, but not in the short term and depends on each project.\n\n# General Conclusion\n\nThe NFT market is a rather modest field when its appeal is limited to simple gaming. You buy an item and expect it to be worth more in the future, but it lacks the interactivity between the player and the game.\n\n2021 can be said to be a \"Welcome to the World of Play To Earn\" year because it has opened up a wave of NFT gaming trends with a lot of positive information surrounding it also created many record numbers in the crypto market.\n\nLeading the way for deeper game interaction is the Axies project and following many other NFT projects participating in the \"play2earn\" game that has brought the entire Ethereum network to life. Since then, many new projects have begun to expand across other Chains to optimise costs and bring more interesting experiences.\n\n# What Is Play2Earn?\n\n## Concept\n\nPlay-To-Earn is a combination of two actions Play & Earn, which means both playing games and earning money. Gaming has been around since the 1970s, each phase has a face of innovation & in 2021, a unique combination of NFT and traditional gaming takes place, giving users (both crypto & non-crypto) a unique experience. new play to earn experience.\n\nPlay to Earn has been around for a long time, for many 8x, 9x generation gamers, the game Silk Road is a good example, you can transform into simulation characters, fight & raise account rank, buy and sell weapons, participate in hunting prizes, etc. If you can \"plow\" to become a terrible level, many powerful weapons can be sold to make money.\n\n## What Is Different About Play2Earn In Crypto 2021?\n\nThanks to blockchain technology and the advantages of the Crypto market, the Play to Earn model has now been improved, specifically:\n\n* Gaming operators have incorporated NFT in their protocol.\n* Improve ownership of in-game assets for users.\n* Players are creating value for other players and developers, in return they are rewarded with in-game assets (native tokens/NFTs).\n\n# Booming\n\nNFT and Play to Earn are very hot topics in recent times and that is also one of the reasons why transactions on the Ethereum network have become active again.\n\n## Gas Used By Smart Contract\n\nAs you can see in the smart contracts on Ethereum that use the most Gas in the past 30 days, Top 1 and Top5 belong to Opensea- The largest NFT Marketplace platform on the market today, Top 4 belongs to Ronin Bridge by Axie Infinity.\n\n \n\n## Trading Volume\n\nIn 2021, we have seen an increase in trading volumes on NFT Dapps, peaking at $86M in March. Currently, it is holding at $38-$39M for the last 3 months.\n\n \n\nWith a play-to-earn model, Axie Infinity is a name that brings a new wave with successful development in the past time. This is a Crypto project conceived by Vietnamese team & launched in 2018. Axie Infinity is built on Loom Network - a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Inspired by the popular game series Pok\u00e9mon and CryptoKitties, players in Axie also need to do quests, battle, and exchange items with other users at the Marketplace.\n\nEach Axie in the game can be purchased and owned as NFT (Non-fungible token), the player needs to raise them with $SLP (Small love potions).

(I mean crypto projects financed by private investors).\n\nThat\u2019s not the case for MATIC which is solely betting its success on users and developers using the blockchain, and conversely granting them the opportunity to save millions in fees and develop lightning fast dApps.\n\nPolygon users and on-chain activity has increased consistently over the past few months to the extent that the number of users on the marketplace has exceeded Ethereum. Even on OpenSea, the world\u2019s largest peer-to-peer marketplace, has more Polygon users than Ethereum, especially when 77% of OpenSea's Polygon NFT sales in August were for $100 or less. \n\nOn another thought, Mina Foundation is working with Polygon to implement support for MinaProtocol on Polygon PoS. The crux of the merge is to keep features like an owner\u2019s identity or sensitive Know Your Customer information hidden from all parties. So the bridge will enable developers building dApps on Polygon to leverage privacy and verifiability using Mina's zk-SNARK-based protocol.\n\nMatic is one of my favorite projects. It has hit a new all-time high in daily active users. I really want to be fair, but don\u2019t you see that MATIC keeps breaking its all-time high in daily active users?",

If you like this, I hope you'll check it out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**OpenSea\u2019s Head of Product Out After Insider Trading**\n\nThis week, [OpenSea\u2019s](https://opensea.io/) Head of Product has left the company on news that he has been trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on insider knowledge of when the company will be promoting individual works.  OpenSea is the world\u2019s largest exchange for NFTs, which have seen explosive growth in demand and valuations over the last few months.  In August, OpenSea had two million transactions and $3.4 billion in trade volume.\n\nOpenSea features a constantly changing rotation of NFTs on their homepage.  The allegation is that Nate Chastain, OpenSea\u2019s Head of Product, was buying these NFTs before they were featured in expectation that they would appreciate in value.  These exchanges were found by a twitter user, [ZuwuTV](https://twitter.com/ZuwuTV/status/1437921263394115584).  Multiple Ethereum wallets were observed buying NFTs just before they were listed on OpenSea\u2019s homepage; these were subsequently sold for a profit, which was then transferred to Chastain\u2019s main wallet.  Just a few days after the tweet by ZuwuTV, OpenSea announced that \u201c . . . yesterday, we requested and accepted his resignation.\u201d\n\nThis debacle was poorly timed for the company as it overshadowed the [launch](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/introducing-the-opensea-mobile-app/) of their mobile app.  OpenSea is funded by well known venture capitalists like Coinbase Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Mark Cuban, and more.  Their recent funding round pushed the valuation of the company over the $1 billion mark.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Solana Outage Slows Growth and Demonstrates Project's Centralization**\n\nOn September 14, the [Solana network](https://status.solana.com/) went down for over 17 hours. During the outage, Coinbase, Binance, and other exchanges suspended trading of SOL, locking up over $10 billion. [Solana (SOL)](https://solana.com/) ([$47 billion](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/) market cap) had recently tripled in market cap, but in the days following this outage Solana lost over 20% of its value and has been slow to rebound.\n\nCrypto projects can \"go public\" through an initial DEX offering (IDO), which is like an initial coin offering (ICO) but on a decentralized exchange (DEX).\n\n[According to Solana](https://nitter.net/aeyakovenko/status/1437795827704029189), the outage was caused by bots flooding the Solana network during an IDO on [Raydium (RAY)](https://raydium.io/). These bots performed 300,000 transactions per second, which Solana could not handle. Apparently, a fix for this issue was already under development.\n\nWhen the network was overloaded, Solana's engineers couldn't fix the issue using the current software release, so Solana upgraded and restarted the network.\n\nCrypto engineers and investors tend to dislike projects with centralized control, but engineers continue to choose Solana due to its extremely fast transactions and low fees. This outage calls into question the reliability of Solana and all the projects built on it. Solana [claims](https://twitter.com/SolanaStatus/status/1438294812378243075?s=20) it will perform a thorough investigation of the outage and prevent similar issues in the future.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Just How Much Adoption Are We Seeing?**\n\nOver the past year, we\u2019ve seen a deluge of stories about companies and countries adopting cryptocurrencies, but is it reasonable to really say we\u2019re seeing \u201cadoption\u201d? Last month, the crypto analytics firm Chainalysis [published a report](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-global-crypto-adoption-index) ranking adoption by country, reporting that we\u2019ve seen a global adoption leap of 880% when compared to the previous year.\n\nFrom their report, Vietnam, India, and Pakistan are leading the way.  In fact, most of the top-20 are composed of countries with emerging economies, including many that have introduced legislation to handle the growth of cryptocurrencies.  Chainalysis attributes much of the emerging market growth to peer-to-peer platform use.  This is the most common on-ramp to cryptocurrency for individuals in these countries, largely because they often have minimal access to centralized exchanges that are available in the developed world.  The primary uses of crypto in this case are to combat inflation in their local currency, to send and receive remittances without being subject to large fees, and to use crypto as a means of exchange.\n\nSome noteworthy countries in the top-20 are Nigeria, where [1 in 3 people](https://www.thismorningonchain.com/crypto/) use cryptocurrency;  Brazil, where trading volume is [up 2,247%](https://www.thismorningonchain.com/crypto/) in the past year;  Venezuela, which has seen hyperinflation of over 2,000% annually; and Afghanistan (21st on the list), which has recently seen tremendous economic uncertainty as a result of Taliban rule.  Also listed within the top-20 were the US, China, Russia, and Brazil.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The Supply Chain is Using the Blockchain**\n\nInternational corporations are turning to blockchain solutions to manage their supply chains. Supply chain blockchain solutions offer solutions for tracking and authenticating materials through each stage of the supply chain, as well as payments.\n\nBlockchain payment solutions can increase efficiency in the supply chain by triggering automatic payments from customer to vendor in particular situations, such as with delivery of a specific item.\n\nTracking and authentication solutions on the blockchain intend to help companies prove a product or material is authentic. Many supply chain cryptos also help companies track their materials through each stage in the supply chain. This tracking data also aids in product recall accuracy and environmental impact tracking and reporting.\n\n**Major Projects:**\n\n[Ethereum (ETH)](https://ethereum.org/en/) ([$393 billion](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) market cap) - Ethereum\u2019s ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT) standard allows for tracking everything in a supply chain efficiently. ERC-721 was [used by Coca-Cola](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2020/cokes-bottlers-to-test-ethereum-for-supply-chain-management/) for a bottling supply chain test.\n\n[VeChain (VET)](https://www.vechain.org/) ([$7 billion](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/vechain/) market cap) - Crypto project designed with supply chain management as a core functionality that has developed partnerships with major corporations in China and worldwide. VeChain allows companies to track materials throughout the supply chain in real time using real-world sensors and scannable QR codes.\n\n[IOTA (MIOTA)](https://www.iota.org/) ([$4.3 billion](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/) market cap) Private blockchain solution intended for enterprise customers with trade secrets and proprietary data. IOTA has established partnerships in agriculture and fashion.\n\nSeveral smaller projects that focus on specialty business solutions have also gained traction:\n\n[OriginTrail (TRAC)](https://origintrail.io/) ([$182 million](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/origintrail/) market cap) - a data exchange protocol for interconnected supply chains that recently doubled in market cap\n\n[Waltonchain (WTC)](https://www.waltonchain.org/#/en) ([$89 million](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/waltonchain/) market cap) - an internet of things (IoT) focused blockchain for supply chain management\n\n[Ambrosus (AMB)](https://ambrosus.io/) ([$21 million](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/amber/) market cap) - a blockchain specifically for supply chain management in the agriculture and pharmaceutical sectors\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Plug-and-Play Miners**\n\nThere are a number of crypto projects that have launched recently with a physical product that mines their crypto token.  These miners do a lot more than the typical GPU mining, and most contribute directly to the use case of the network.  The only thing they all have in common is that demand greatly exceeds supply \u2013 they\u2019re mostly back ordered for months.  Here\u2019s a list of the easiest miners to buy and immediately begin using with minimal technical set-up, called \u201cPlug and Play\u201d mining.\n\n[Helium (HNT)](https://www.thismorningonchain.com/helium-hnt-the-crypto-mined-on-network-hotspots/) - Highly rated ones range from $150 - $430\n\nHelium is a \"proof-of-coverage\" cryptocurrency project operating a global wireless network intended for internet of things (IoT) devices. The Helium network is powered by special hotspots that provide network coverage and mine HNT coins.  As far as the hotspot miners go, there is a wide range, but most are backordered for months.\n\n[Akash (AKT)](https://akash.network/supermini) - $975\n\nAkash Network is the world\u2019s first decentralized open-source cloud, providing faster, more efficient, and lower cost application deployments for high-growth industries including DeFi, decentralized organizations and applications, and machine learning/AI.  Their Supermini is sold out, but was listed at $975.  Technically, this isn\u2019t a miner, but it offers compute power in exchange for tokens.\n\n[Deeper Network (DPR)](https://deeper.network/) - Starts at $249\n\nDeeper Network combines blockchain, network security, and sharing economy to create a global peer-to-peer network that empowers the real users of the internet and paves the way for the next generation of the web.  Deeper Network has a number of devices available and a low electricity footprint.\n\n**TL;DR:** Companies are beginning to launch hardware-based crypto projects building distributed networks working around wifi hotspots, distributed VPNs, distributed supercomputing, etc.  Since most of these projects are new, they\u2019re still sold out and backordered.",

Last week Yourticketprovider announced that it would turn its 2 million tickets sold annually into NFT tickets.\n\n**Interest of NFT tickets in the ticketing industry**\n\nIn the ticketing industry, NFT tickets have recently gained a lot of popularity. **Mark Cuban and Ted Leonsis (NBA team owners)** both see the added value of NFT tickets and want to turn their tickets into NFTs. Additionally, major ticketing companies like **Ticketmaster and Seatgeek** are actively working on implementing NFT ticketing. Ticketmaster recently launched a FAQ for its NFT ticket marketplace. Seatgeek hired a blockchain executive as VP of engineering and Seatgeek plans to roll out NFT ticketing for the NFL and NBA. Furthermore there is interest from non-crypto institutional investment funds in NFT ticketing and GET protocol (an NFT ticketing solution). **Barry Ritholtz** (founder and chairman of **Ritholtz Wealth Management, 2.3 billion** assets under its management) wrote about the topic in his personal blog.\n\n**Benefits of NFT tickets include:**\n\n**Increased profitability -** Total control and insights over the primary & secondary market. Take in the profit that would have gone to scalpers.\n\n**Collectible** \\- Tickets become tradable digital collectibles (NFTs), with a variety of awesome possibilities for fans & event organizers.\n\n**Unrivalled data** \\- Clear, verifiable data on ticket ownership, vastly improving marketing efforts.\n\n**Adoption**\n\nYouticketprovider partnered with GET protocol this week to turn their **2 million tickets sold annually into NFT tickets**. Yourticketprovider will use the digital twin product that allows ticketing companies to easily GET protocol is one of the main projects developing and selling NFT tickets. So far 7 ticketing companies are using the white label product of GET protocol. In total more than **800k tickets have been sold using GET protocol**. Ticket sales have been limited the past 1.5 year because of the global pandemic. I expect that the NFT ticket sales will see exponential growth as restrictions for events will get lifted globally.\n\nWhat I personally like is that all ticket sales can be easily checked and verified on chain using the NFT ticket explorer.\n\n[https://explorer.get-protocol.io/](https://explorer.get-protocol.io/)\n\n**Crypto Partnerships**\n\n**Polygon**\n\nGET protocol switched from Ethereum to polygon this year.

            "text": "Hey /r/CryptoCurrencies, a few of you recommended I directly drop in our weekly newsletter here (hopefully this doesn't get flagged again).  It's a quick round up on last weeks news, with a bit of learning new projects sprinkled in.  Let me know what you think!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Coinbase v SEC**\n\n\nThere has been another wave of regulation buzz this week as Coinbase took the offensive and called out the SEC.  Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong [took to Twitter](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1435439291715358721?s=20) to identify a pattern of \u201csketchy\u201d behavior he\u2019s experienced directed toward Coinbase.  Here\u2019s the story, according to Brian: the company was planning to roll out a feature called Lend, which would allow users to lend their cryptocurrency for a return.  This is a common feature in the crypto world, with most major wallets and exchanges offering it natively.  When Coinbase made the SEC aware that they will be releasing the feature, the SEC responded by declaring that crypto lending is considered a security.\n\n\nCoinbase executives requested further explanation and in response, the SEC subpoenaed documents from Coinbase, demanded testimony from their employees, and informed the company they will be sued if Coinbase proceeds to launch their Lend feature.  Armstrong went on to explain that the new head of the SEC had previously dodged an attempt to introduce himself to regulators on a May trip to DC, being told \u201cwe\u2019re not meeting with any crypto companies.\u201d  In Coinbase\u2019s [official posted statement](https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009), they reveal that the SEC requested the name and contact information for everyone on their Lend waitlist, which the company refused to give.\n\n\nMark Cuban [posted](https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1435454959441620995) his take in response to Armstrong\u2019s tweets, calling this \u201cRegulation via Litigation\u201d, stating that the SEC is struggling to set reasonable regulation and is instead planning to leave it to the lawyers.\n\n\n**TLDR:** The SEC has officially stated it plans to sue Coinbase if they release their lending feature, a feature many other exchanges already offer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Mastercard Acquires Crypto Forensics Firm CipherTrace**\n\n\nCredit card company Mastercard will acquire crypto forensics giant CipherTrace. CipherTrace provides transparency in crypto investments, identifying possible theft, fraud, and money laundering. The company's clients are governments and other companies that need to track crypto projects, and CipherTrace helps protect crypto companies and financial institutions from security and compliance risks. Currently, CipherTrace tracks and reports on over 7,000 crypto assets.\n\n\nCipherTrace can help clients detect crime in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, which is experiencing massive growth and attracting criminals. In mid-August, there was over $80 billion of value locked on DeFi platforms. DeFi crime this year has totaled almost $700 million.\n\n\nThe two main types of DeFi crimes are hacks and \"rug pulls.\" According to CipherTrace, roughly [three-quarters of DeFi crime](https://www.reuters.com/technology/defi-crime-hits-record-high-first-7-months-2021-ciphertrace-2021-08-10/) this year has been protocol hacks, where hackers exploit the underlying code running an exchange and steal the money. About one-quarter of DeFi crime has been rug pulls, where the people running the project quit and take the money.\n\n\nThis is the latest move by Mastercard into the crypto space, following their [announcement](https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2021/why-mastercard-is-bringing-crypto-onto-our-network/) of crypto payment cards early this year, and the start of a [crypto project launch pad](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210727005244/en/Mastercard-Launches-New-Start-Path-Cryptocurrency-and-Blockchain-Program-for-Startups) this summer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Bored Ape Yacht Club Auction Sells for $24 Million**\n\n\nThe growing NFT art trend had yet another impressive showing this week when a collection of 101 [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/) NFTs sold for $24 Million, at an average price of $241,500 per NFT.  The average price per Bored Ape on secondary markets is roughly $160,000.  The Bored Ape project is one of the early generative art lines (projects where the NFT gets a number of random traits for the image at the time of minting) to gain major traction.  [The auction](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2021/ape-in/101-bored-ape-yacht-club) was conducted by Sotheby\u2019s, one of the world\u2019s largest fine art brokers, which started auctioning NFTs earlier this year.\n\n\nThe sale crushed Sotheby\u2019s target price range of $12M-$18M and included a total of 107 NFTs.  Bored Ape Yacht Club recently released an add-on NFT called mutant serums which \u201cmutate\u201d the original NFTs and yield a second Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFT.  This is one of several rewards granted to holders of the original NFT, alongside a free NFT from the Bored Ape Kennel Club line.  Kennel Club also recently had an auction of 101 NFTs, which sold for a total of $1.8M.\n\n\nThe project has been garnering attention from big name celebrities and athletes such as [Stephen Curry](https://decrypt.co/79676/nba-star-stephen-curry-buys-ethereum-bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-for-180k), Dez Bryant, The Chainsmokers, and many more. This week also had the largest individual sale of a Bored Ape at $2.9M.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Should You Hold a Wrapped Token?**\n\n\nWrapped tokens are cryptos pegged to the value of another asset. A wrapped token is like a stablecoin, except its value is pegged to an asset such as Bitcoin. Wrapped tokens are usually used for compatibility in cross-chain transactions, but they can also be held by investors.\n\n\nWrapped tokens work like stablecoins: a custodian holds the balance of the asset, keeping the same amount that is wrapped. The custodian can be a merchant, a DAO, or a smart contract.\n\n\nWrapped tokens are used to make cross-chain transactions, such as trading [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://bitcoin.org/en/) on the Ethereum network. Since Bitcoin and Ethereum aren't compatible, the exchange could instead use [Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)](https://wbtc.network/), an Ethereum-compatible wrapped token pegged to Bitcoin. Wrapped tokens operate on-chain, so they incur gas fees. Investors have to pay gas fees to wrap and unwrap their assets.\n\n\nWrapped tokens are a good option for cross-chain transactions, but are they too risky to hold? Since the wrapped token software is operated by a custodian, there is additional risk compared to holding the native asset. The custodian could be hacked or rug pull the project.\n\n\nSome assets, such as BTC and ETH, are easy to acquire and hold, so holding WBTC or WETH is likely an unnecessary risk. Other assets, such as [Nexus Mutual (NXM)](https://nexusmutual.io/) are more difficult to acquire due to KYC requirements, but there is a wrapped version available with no KYC requirements: [Wrapped NXM (WNXM)](https://research.binance.com/en/projects/wrapped-nxm). Although there is considerably more risk to holding WNXM, investors may consider this acceptable due to the ease of swapping WNXM compared to the native NXM.\n\n\n**TLDR:** A wrapped token gives you the option to more easily access assets (for example, avoiding Know Your Customer (KYC), though it adds more risk than directly holding an asset.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Project Spotlight: BitClout**\n\n\n[BitClout](https://bitclout.com/) (CLOUT) is a blockchain-based social media project that \u201cmixes speculation and social media.\u201d  People make short posts that show up in a cultivated timeline, much like Twitter.  Each account on the platform has a Creator Coin, a coin that you can buy or sell that works on a yield curve to determine its value.  Creators can set a percentage of their coin to keep from all transactions.  The goal of BitClout is to create an asset class which is tied to the reputation of an individual directly. Some of the features released, or planned for release, revolve around exclusive access to holders of coins; the company has considered Stakeholder Meetings, Premium Messages, Sponsored Posts, and Premium Content.  \n\n\nOne of the most exciting parts of BitClout is the community that has sprung up around it.  The home page has a list of major projects, all of which trade directly on BitClout and are available to invest in from the moment they launch.  The top project is [BitClout Pulse](http://bitcloutpulse.com/), a BitClout analytics company describing themselves as \u201cBloomberg for BitClout.\u201d\n\n\nBitClout launched in March 2021 with much of the staff being entirely anonymous \u2013 the CEO is simply known as \u201cDiamond Hands.\u201d  The project has raised funding from many of the top tech investors, like Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Coinbase Ventures, and Winklevoss Capital, as well as from well known individuals such as Chamath Palihapitiya (a confirmed user on the site).",

In my opinion, platforms that provide that for users are contributing in bringing NFTs to the masses, and personally I find Polygon to be leading the way for many reasons:\n\nFirst: the first ever Dolce & Gabbana NFT drop will be powered by Polygon, giving the NFT market mainstream media attention.\n\nSecond: MATIC is saving both NFT creators and collectors millions in fees by providing next to nothing gas fees, for example 77% of OpenSea (Polygon) NFT sales in August were for less than $100.\n\nThird: Showtime is now live on Polygon; this will allow creators to mint gas-free NFTs on Polygon PoS, also Showtime users will be able to interact with artists, browse their personalized news feed, scroll through popular NFTs on the trending section, and more features. \n\n\nThere are thousands of other examples that prove why and how Polygon is immensely helping NFT creators and collectors, while also giving the chance for new users to join the market without having to worry about high gas fees, slow transactions or security. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t understand all the negative sentiment coming from the Ethereum crowd, since Polygon is literally the chain that\u2019s making Ethereum useable way before Arbitrum even talked about it.",

At the same time, NFTs are emerging at a time when fans are eager to join digital communities centered around their favorite artists or sports teams.\n\nProfessional sports were hit especially hard by the pandemic, with an estimated $18 billion in lost revenue across major leagues worldwide. According to Visa, this further drives the \u201cneed to diversify revenue and focus on technology to reposition businesses for growth opportunities and to capture the attention of fans.\u201d\n\nIn this sense, \u201cNFTs appeal to collectors, fans, teams, leagues, and talent,\u201d the report said. In particular, NFTs can become primary sources of fan engagement, customer relationship management and newer revenue streams. The main NFT use cases identified were collectibles, art and gaming.\n\nThe whitepaper was released alongside an announcement from Visa that it had purchased its first NFT \u2014 CryptoPunk 7610 \u2014 for $150,000. CryptoPunks is a collection of 10,000 unique NFTs with proof of ownership stored on the Ethereum network. A total of 2,519 CryptoPunk collectibles were sold in the past 30 days, netting a combined $467.4 million, according to industry sources. Over that period, the highest-grossing sale was CryptoPunk 7252, which sold for 1,600 ETH, or $4.5 million.\n\n***Related:*** ***Visa invests $150,000 in NFT CryptoPunk asset***\n\nBeyond the CryptoPunk craze, NFTs in other niches are also growing in popularity. As Cointelegraph recently reported, total NFT sales are likely to exceed $900 million in August alone, marking a new record for the industry. The previous record was set in May when total sales volume for NFTs reached $255 million. May was when crypto markets reached new all-time highs before experiencing a multi-month correction.\n\nVisa\u2019s foray into NFTs is hardly surprising, given the payment company\u2019s growing focus on digital assets. The company recently entered into an agreement with digital asset platform Zipmex, providing further crypto payment integration in the Asia-Pacific region. In January of this year, Visa reaffirmed its commitment to building cryptocurrency payment and fiat on-ramps in a bid to support the digital asset class.\n\n**Here are the five most popular universal and digital art-oriented NFT marketplaces currently available:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **OpenSea**: *This is one of the most established universal NFT marketplaces. You can find non-fungible tokens representing ownership of a wide variety of things, including artwork, sports collectibles, virtual worlds, trading cards, and domain names.*\n* **Raible**: *This is an NFT marketplace owned by the community members holding RARI tokens. It puts an emphasis on art, but you can find a wide range of other NFT items here, too.*\n* **Dropsnft:** *Drops is a new protocol that is designed to leverage NFTs as collateral for loans. Designed with the future of financial NFTs in mind, Drops aims to optimize the utility of NFT assets to minimize their opportunity cost and maximize the returns of holding them.\u00a0This platform enables you to get more leverage out of your assets for loans and yield-farming.*\n* **super rare**: *Another marketplace focused on digital art is SuperRare, which works with a select handful of leading concept artists.*\n* **Unifty:** *Unifty is a multichain infrastructure platform for NFT creators and the digital creator ecosystem. Currently operational on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), xDAI, Polygon (ex Matic), Celo, and Avalanche. Unifty seeks to offer accessible and affordable no-code solutions to mint NFTs, and enable functionality. We also offer marketplaces on a number of networks and offer native support of the first \u201cinteractive\u201d NFTs (iNFTs*",

If I mint 20 NFTs, I will have to pay huge  expenses in ETH gas fees.\n\nIs it possible somehow to create multiple NFTs at once and pay gas fees only once for the whole collection?\n\nI  understand if one wants to sell NFTs, Ethereum is where you want them  to be, since there is much less interest in Polygon or BSC NFTs. Would  this understanding be right?\n\nAlso,  any guide to pricing NFTs? I have some material that may be interesting  to some people, but it's hard to assess how much interest they will  generate.",

            "text": "Something can only have (monetary store) value if it is scarce. Bitcoin is scarce as there will only ever be 21 million of it in total. You cannot just copy it, though there has been forks, the vast majority of the network, nodes and miners remain behind bitcoin. You could say that miners are scarce. There are only so many miners active.\n\nERC-20 tokens can be created almost for free. Little effort is needed for creating a token as the tokens run on existing ethereum nodes (or Binance chain or other blockchain with smart contract support). These tokens don't have a blockchain of their own. Are such tokens scarce?\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of different ERC-20 tokens. So without a use case, there is no scarcity, no value. Because a use case for a token is what makes the token scarce, and distinguishes it from other tokens that don't have that specific use case.\n\nWe see a lot of meme coins and garbage coins with no use case, and I've seen creators trying to shill the coins and use tokenomics, ways to encourage holding and discourage selling. This often results in low volume compared to its market cap and high volatily.\nThey try to convince new people that their token is special and unique, to make it sound like it is scarce without the need of a use case. Typically, they use influencers and they try to flood social media to shill their own garbage bags.\n\nPrice action of these coins depend mostly on shills. Like dogecoin shoots up every time Elon Musk mentions it (though dogecoin has its own chain). That does not make dogecoin a good or bad coin. It just reflects how much attention it is getting.\n\nSuppose you have a coin where send coins to the smart contract address of the token and it instantly sends the same amount back to you plus an extra 10%. And you can repeat as often as you like. Sounds good, right? Would you call this a use case?\nIt's a way of distributing more of the same tokens, but I don't see this as an \"external\" use case. It adds no value, no effort, nothing. It only changes some number in the smart contract internally.",

Traders increased their bids for the pair after Polygon stated that it will form a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for its community members (quite similar to Phoenix DAO), with a focus on the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) area.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPolygon, a company that provides layer-two scaling solutions for Ethereum applications, set aside $100 million towards the DAO's establishment as well as the inclusion of DeFi projects in its interoperability pool. The company also stated that current Polygon users will be eligible for a free airdrop of new DAO governance tokens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe strong interim fundamentals have boosted MATIC demand among speculators, resulting in a two-day price rise. Meanwhile, the upward movement triggered a typical bullish setup, which may push MATIC prices to new highs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe pattern, dubbed \"inverse head and shoulders,\" is a typical bullish reversal indication that emerges when the market hits three consecutive troughs below a resistance-like neckline. When measured from the neckline, the center trough (head) seems to be deeper than the other two (shoulders).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen the price goes above the neckline, technical chartists generally take a long position, with the pattern's maximum height plus the breakout level acting as their final profit objective. Their stop loss is usually around the right shoulder's lowest position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the MATIC/USDT three-day chart, using textbook definitions, the pair forms an inverse head and shoulders pattern.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFollowing a 150 percent price rebound from the June 18 low of $0.62, Polygon's token slid past the neckline resistance of $1.51 on Aug. 20. (the head). As a result, the inverted head and shoulders pattern's maximum height amounted to $0.89.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a consequence, if the MATIC/USDT rate rises over $1.51, accompanied by a surge in trading activity, the pair's chances of gaining $0.89 improve. It would then aim for an inverted head and shoulders profit goal of $2.40, about $0.30 below the current record high.",

We have recently completed an [audit of our V2 contracts](https://solidity.finance/audits/Dracula/) with Solidity Finance, which resulted in no security issues and overall praise for our developers\u2019 abilities.\n\nWith this audit complete, the Dracula team now feels confident enough to move onto the testing phase of our contracts, which will begin with deploying the V2 contracts on the Ethereum Kovan testnet. We will be running a series of stress-tests, but are confident that the functionality of the DRC token will remain unchanged throughout this testing phase and are comfortable releasing details about the planned tokenomics for V2.\n\nDracula Protocol V2 will continue to use the DRC token that was used on V1, although the utility of DRC will be much different.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wdc8n0dkp0o61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=87b6555cdb4af96929cf6c91090871eb30acbec5\n\n**DRC Supply Cap:** The DRC token, which can be found on Etherscan at [https://etherscan.io/token/0xb78B3320493a4EFaa1028130C5Ba26f0B6085Ef8](https://etherscan.io/token/0xb78B3320493a4EFaa1028130C5Ba26f0B6085Ef8), will have a capped supply at the launch of our V2 contracts, which will be an estimated amount of 15,000,000 DRC. At the moment of deploying, all DRC minting will be disabled. From here on out, there will never be a new DRC token minted again. Although this can be changed through a governance vote, the Dracula team strongly recommends a hard-cap on the DRC supply.\n\n**Static Supply:** Although there has been discussion around deflationary tokenomics, we have decided to not follow that path. By not having a percent of our drain allocated to burns, we can use the additional yield to increase the earnings of stakers for our victim pools and our DRC pool.\n\n**Drain Allocation:** Once every day, our platform will sell underlying rewards for ETH, which is known as a \u2018Drain\u2019. This drain will be called by the Dracula team and is funded by a portion of the underlying yields from victims. Going forward, we have plans to integrate a system of nodes to automatically call the drain once certain parameters are met through a strategic partnership.\n\nEach drain will be distributed as follows:  \n**85% of each drain** goes to liquidity providers of victim pools, such as SushiSwap or Pickle. These funds are automatically invested into an interest-earning ETH strategy, which will accrue additional yield until each user chooses to harvest their individual earnings. Users can choose to harvest their yields on ETH, *or in DRC,* for any of the pools. If a user chooses to harvest their yields in DRC, then the ETH they have earned is used to buy DRC off the open market at the time of withdrawal.\n\n**Note:** If a user unstakes within 24 hours from depositing into victim pools, there is a 0.5% fee taken from their liquidity. This is to prevent manipulation of the drain mechanism.\n\n**3.75% of each drain** goes to stakers in the DRC staking pool. This will be the only DRC staking pool, yields will be in ETH.\n\n**3% of each drain** goes to liquidity providers of the DRC/ETH pool on {REDACTED}, yields will be in ETH.\n\n**3% of each drain** goes to liquidity providers of the DRC/ETH pool on Uniswap, yields will be in ETH.\n\n**3.75% of each drain** goes to the developer fund to help continue the ongoing development of Dracula Protocol, yields will be in ETH.\n\n**1.5% of each drain** goes to the gas fund to pay for future drains, yields will be in ETH.\n\n**Note:** After each drain, these rewards are linearly distributed to each user over the following 24 hours, which will ensure consistent yields rather than spiked earnings after each drain.\n\n**DRC Utility:** The DRC token can be currently staked to earn 3.75% of all ETH that comes from drains. This design ensures that APRs for DRC staking is directly dependent on TVL of Dracula Protocol and the APRs from underlying platforms.\n\nIf Dracula Protocol manages to capture significant TVL from underlying platforms with high APRs, the staked DRC token will have a direct cash-flow to this performance, paid in ETH. This token design is meant to focus on ROI for DRC token holders, where their initial investment to earn a share of protocol performance is quickly outpaced in terms of ETH earned.\n\nDRC also has voting rights to the future of Dracula Protocol. Going forward, we plan on adding new features to add to the utility of DRC, such as integrations with lending platforms, tokenized staking for composability, and more.\n\nWe believe that the DRC token can be used as an *index token for the performance of the underlying DeFi platforms*, as its returns are directly dependent on APRs for its victims, which are a result of healthy token appreciation from underlying platforms like SUSHI or PICKLE. This functionality creates a synergy between Dracula and its victims and opens the possibility for future collaboration with any of the underlying platforms.\n\nThe implications of the V2 DRC token design are massive and we are truly excited to have this idea come to fruition. Our next update will be at the launch of our V2 contracts on mainnet, where all of the described changes will be live in production. We will also be detailing our ecosystem partners after our V2 launch, which are fundamental to Dracula Protocol, DRC, and the future of DeFi.\n\n**Keep up with us on our socials for further updates, soon to come!**\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/DraculaProtocol](https://twitter.com/DraculaProtocol)",

And we\u2019re only just getting started.\n\n\nAll GET-powered events, with unknowing early adopters of kick-ass blockchain tech.\n\nFinding a home for our NFT Tickets has been a long process that has given us a vast insight into the various platforms currently available. It has always been our prerogative to ensure that the platform of choice provides stability whilst being a scalable solution that supports our blockchain activity, ranging from our current NFT registration to our upcoming\u00a0DeFi plans.\nWith this said, we\u2019re happy to announce today that we\u2019ve found a platform that goes above and beyond this criteria and our NFT Tickets are settled in and ready to ticket events. That home is of course Polygon!\n\n\n\nBackground on Polygon\n\nSo what is Polygon? Polygon offers a multi-chain scaling solution that combines the best of Ethereum compatible blockchain networks with an interoperable protocol that has been designed for a scalable and flexible experience.\nWhat this means is that Polygon essentially offers blockchains that run alongside the Ethereum mainchain, which are faster and cheaper than the mainchain itself. Users can bridge between the Ethereum mainchain and Polygon sidechains in order to have a quick and easy way of transacting without heavy fees.\n\nWhy GET Protocol Benefits From Polygon\n\nOur NFT Ticketing solution requires a platform that can support the growth in volume of ticketing whilst providing unwavering stability without compromising on decentralisation.\nWith a system that has such good interoperability with the Ethereum chain, it is notable how many large and reputable projects are moving to Polygon. These projects feature helpful services to GET Protocol, such as various DeFi tools which are useful for us as we further move towards our decentralised financing services.\nIt\u2019s always good however to again re-iterate that we are a blockchain agnostic project and will always be looking at ways we can implement projects and tools that can benefit the ticketing experience we provide.\n\nHow GET Protocol\u2019s NFT Ticketing Benefits Polygon\n\nGET Protocol is of course bringing a real world, industry disrupting system to the Polygon chain. Our NFT Tickets introduce a novel use case that many in the NFT community have not discovered currently.\nBy integrating onto the Polygon chain, we\u2019re showing to the wider cryptocurrency community that Polygon is a platform that businesses can trust and rely upon for their blockchain needs. With 700,000+ tickets sold through the protocol to date and many more to come, we believe this is a great vote of confidence for Polygon.\n\n\n\nFor those wondering about the benefits of NFT Tickets.\n\nWhat is to come?\n\nThe arrival at Polygon will take place upon the launch of our new NFT Ticket explorer, which is is set to be released in a matter of days. Not only will ticket holders and others interested in the protocol be able to track all NFT ticket activity, the explorer will also open the door to NFT collectibles linked to real world experiences.\nWe\u2019re of course working closely with the Polygon team to highlight this partnership and ensure a good working relationship as we move forward. It also goes without saying that now we\u2019ve fully integrated our ticketing onto Polygon, we are working hard to open up discovery of NFT Ticketing to the wider community and bring this exciting use case to everyone looking to further the expansion of blockchain adoption.\n\nhttps://medium.com/get-protocol/scaling-the-nft-ticketing-use-case-globally-get-protocol-x-polygon-7d5094864a80",

It all makes sense now, PIVX 5.0 is rumored to be released on testnet in the upcoming days, aligned with the Ethereum 2.0 soft launch on December 1st. PIVX is already rising with huge volume. According to the leaked document, PIVX is expected to rise 30x in 2021, which is around $9 per coin.\n\nI have been doing some research, the technology behind PIVX is really impressive same as what they are intending to achieve in the upcoming months: anonymous masternodes, anonymous governance model with anonymous voting, anonymous staking and some major improvements on their Proof of Stake consensus to decentralize the network much further and also incentivize shielded staking.\n\nCheck the [Tweet here](https://twitter.com/privacy_anycost/status/1330293503797194759?s=21), or directly the [leaked document here](https://gofile.io/d/CwOUpz).\n\nAs always, DYOR, but this looks pretty impressive.",

The primary sale (from the \u2018minting\u2019 of the coin by an environmental agency certifying their carbon credit to the very first buyer) will definitely fund new projects, but after that it kinda loses its purpose\n\nFunnily enough the coins that I\u2019ve found that tie the best of both worlds are medical science related - Curecoin and the meme-coin banano both use the same method of \u2018mining\u2019 where you dedicate your cpu/gpu (even if you\u2019ve only got a laptop) to simulating complex protein structures to help research for COVID, cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s etc, and in return earn coins as a reward...

            "text": "Dracula Protocol V2 launch is around the corner! We have recently completed an audit with Solidity Finance, which resulted in no security issues and overall praise for our developers\u2019 abilities.\n\nWith this audit complete, the Dracula team now feels confident enough to move onto the testing phase of our contracts, which will begin with deploying the V2 contracts on the Ethereum Kovan testnet. We will be running a series of stress-tests, but are confident that the functionality of the DRC token will remain unchanged throughout this testing phase and are comfortable releasing details about the planned tokenomics for V2.\n\nDracula Protocol V2 will continue to use the DRC token that was used on V1, although the utility of DRC will be much different.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4iq9n81c7to61.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddb09010097eb94c4efae5c11b81b3f57c83c3f7\n\n**DRC Supply Cap:** The DRC token, which can be found on Etherscan at **0xb78B3320493a4EFaa1028130C5Ba26f0B6085Ef8**, will have a capped supply at the launch of our V2 contracts, which will be an estimated amount of 15,000,000 DRC. At the moment of deploying, all DRC minting will be disabled. From here on out, there will never be a new DRC token minted again. Although this can be changed through a governance vote, the Dracula team strongly recommends a hard-cap on the DRC supply.\n\n**Static Supply:** Although there has been discussion around deflationary tokenomics, we have decided to not follow that path. By not having a percent of our drain allocated to burns, we can use the additional yield to increase the earnings of stakers for our victim pools and our DRC pool.\n\n**Drain Allocation:** Once every day, our platform will sell underlying rewards for ETH, which is known as a \u2018Drain\u2019. This drain will be called by the Dracula team and is funded by a portion of the underlying yields from victims. Going forward, we have plans to integrate a system of nodes to automatically call the drain once certain parameters are met through a strategic partnership.\n\nEach drain will be distributed as follows:  \n**85% of each drain** goes to liquidity providers of victim pools, such as SushiSwap or Pickle. These funds are automatically invested into an interest-earning ETH strategy, which will accrue additional yield until each user chooses to harvest their individual earnings. Users can choose to harvest their yields on ETH, *or in DRC,* for any of the pools. If a user chooses to harvest their yields in DRC, then the ETH they have earned is used to buy DRC off the open market at the time of withdrawal.\n\n**Note:** If a user unstakes within 24 hours from depositing into victim pools, there is a 0.5% fee taken from their liquidity. This is to prevent manipulation of the drain mechanism.\n\n**3.75% of each drain** goes to stakers in the DRC staking pool. This will be the only DRC staking pool, yields will be in ETH.\n\n**3% of each drain** goes to liquidity providers of the DRC/ETH pool on {REDACTED}, yields will be in ETH.\n\n**3% of each drain** goes to liquidity providers of the DRC/ETH pool on Uniswap, yields will be in ETH.\n\n**3.75% of each drain** goes to the developer fund to help continue the ongoing development of Dracula Protocol, yields will be in ETH.\n\n**1.5% of each drain** goes to the gas fund to pay for future drains, yields will be in ETH.\n\n**Note:** After each drain, these rewards are linearly distributed to each user over the following 24 hours, which will ensure consistent yields rather than spiked earnings after each drain.\n\n**DRC Utility:** The DRC token can be currently staked to earn 3.75% of all ETH that comes from drains. This design ensures that APRs for DRC staking is directly dependent on TVL of Dracula Protocol and the APRs from underlying platforms.\n\nIf Dracula Protocol manages to capture significant TVL from underlying platforms with high APRs, the staked DRC token will have a direct cash-flow to this performance, paid in ETH. This token design is meant to focus on ROI for DRC token holders, where their initial investment to earn a share of protocol performance is quickly outpaced in terms of ETH earned.\n\nDRC also has voting rights to the future of Dracula Protocol. Going forward, we plan on adding new features to add to the utility of DRC, such as integrations with lending platforms, tokenized staking for composability, and more.\n\nWe believe that the DRC token can be used as an *index token for the performance of the underlying DeFi platforms*, as its returns are directly dependent on APRs for its victims, which are a result of healthy token appreciation from underlying platforms like SUSHI or PICKLE. This functionality creates a synergy between Dracula and its victims and opens the possibility for future collaboration with any of the underlying platforms.\n\nThe implications of the V2 DRC token design are massive and we are truly excited to have this idea come to fruition. Our next update will be at the launch of our V2 contracts on mainnet, where all of the described changes will be live in production. We will also be detailing our ecosystem partners after our V2 launch, which are fundamental to Dracula Protocol, DRC, and the future of DeFi.\n\n**Keep up with us on our socials for further updates, soon to come!**  \n\n\nDracula Subreddit r/Draculaprotocol",

No more uncertainty whether the shitcoin you farm pumps or dumps.Also the yields are always higher than the original pools.

So nothing stands in the way of continuous further development.There will be many partners , $RGT is one of them. The TVL will explode and anything under 10 dollars is fud. Has nothing to do with the fact that I shill my own bag, I would even have to see that if I didn't hold DRC.\n\nV2 is just around the corner an this time its's for real.",

In the near future NFTs are going to solve problems in industries, which consumers face regularly.\n\nBelow are my top 3 favourite use cases for NFTs.\n\nWhat is your favourtie use case of NFTs beyond Art\n\n**1. Event Ticketing** \n\nUsing unique, unforgeable NFTs to represent tickets for specific sports and entertainment events helps to prevent scalping and scamming. [**Smart contracts**](https://blog.makerdao.com/how-ethereum-smart-contracts-power-dai-the-maker-protocol-and-defi/) can be used to make tickets non-transferable to prevent scalpers from purchasing sought-after tickets in bulk and then reselling them at inflated prices and prevent scammers from trying to sell counterfeit tickets.\n\nOn a podcast in March, Mark Cuban, billionaire investor and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, expressed a great deal of interest in NFT technology. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find a good option for turning our tickets into NFTs. We want to be able to find ways so that not only can our consumers, our fans, buy tickets and resell them, but we continue to make a royalty on them.\n\n**2. The Music and Video Industry**\n\nIn much the same way [**NFTs have helped artists discover new ways to create their works and reach new markets**](https://blog.makerdao.com/decentralized-stable-crypto-tokens-broaden-their-appeal-to-the-digital-artwork-market/), the tokens are also transforming how musicians create and share their music and videos.\n\nThe properties of NFTs\u2014uniqueness, verifiability, transferability\u2014offer musicians greater independence from labels and other gatekeepers of their industry, better enabling them to self-distribute their work and cultivate direct relationships with fans. Musicians can sell tracks as NFTs on marketplaces such as OpenSea, auction previously unpublished material as limited-release NFTs, and even sell rights to their works.\n\nThese tokens can generate fast and significant interest from fans. Alternative musician Grimes sold digital art and videos as NFTs for almost $6 million on [**Nifty Gateway**](https://niftygateway.com/profile/grimes) in 20 minutes earlier this year.**2**Rock band Kings of Leon recently generated $2 million in NFT sales of their new album in just [**one week**](https://www.nme.com/news/music/kings-of-leon-have-generated-2million-from-nft-sales-of-their-new-album-2899349).\n\nNFTs have the potential to replace conventional subscription models for \u201csuper-fans.\u201d For example, they can be programmed so that the subscribers holding them can access premium music and video content or even highly exclusive benefits, such as lifetime front-row seats to concerts.**3** Those same NFTs can also be programmed to collect royalties for musicians every time they are [**sold and resold**](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/10-setting-fees-on-secondary-sales).\u00a0\n\n**3. Unique Experiences**\n\nSome industries are using NFTs to tokenize historic moments. The sports industry, for example, is capturing such moments using collectible card-style NFTs. Sports personalities are leading the way by including experiential content in NFTs that only owners can \u201cunlock.\u201d An [**NFT created by American basketball player Luka Garza**](https://opensea.io/assets/luka-garza-consensus-national-player-of-the-year-n) includes the opportunity to meet him, compete with him in a game of HORSE, and join him for dinner and a movie.",

I\u2019ve been following this topic for a while now and I can tell that we see new providers announcing some form of NFT Ticketing on a weekly basis.\n\nIt\u2019s very different levels of service though. Some are just art NFTs that can be used as a ticket to give you access. And other providers are truly intending to reshape the world of ticketing.\n\nSome providers just service themselves while others are acting like a TAAS (Ticketing As A Service) operator.\n\nThe main challenge is to provide a service that is able to handle volume ! Like filling a stadium with 50.000 fans. There aren\u2019t many out there yet who manage to do this in a stable way.\n\nAs far as I can judge, the project with the \u2018highest\u2019 vision is ran by Get Protocol: https://get-protocol.io/. They have really looked at the ticketing business with all its flaws using a helicopter view, and then they came with an integral solution.\n\nTheir mission is to set the new industry standard for a Right To Enter (in any form: digital of physical entrance). And any industry: events, public transport, online streams, museum, fun parks, etc.). \n\nWith their protocol any event organizer can use their protocol. They have white labels that use it all the same (like: https://guts.tickets/nl/). They are well on their way to become a DAO.\n\nAll their tickets can be verified via their NFT Ticket Explorer. https://explorer.get-protocol.io/ . Nearly 1 mln tickets were processed already.\n\nVery efficient in my opinion, it saves everyone the trouble of inventing their own protocol.\n\nThe subreddit r/NFTTickets has been a great source of info too.\n\nExciting theme!",

More and more artists are using NFTs for ticketing due to the wealth of advantages over traditional forms of ticketing. \n\nI think NFT tickets   are on the brink of an explosion in adoption. NFT tickets allow event organizers to integrate the primary and the secondary market and get royalties from secondary market sales. No longer will scalpers which don't add any value to an event, be the biggest financial beneficiary.\r  \n\r  \nFurthermore, you can attach collectible to a ticket. Ticketmaster is exploring \"magic moments\" for festivals and events. Similar to NBA topshots, but than as an added value for people that have actually attended and witnessed a special moment in a sports game or event\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.ledgerinsights.com/ticketmaster-live-nation-nft-marketplace-event-concert-video-moments/\r  \n\r  \nTraditional ticketing companies like seatgeek are already planning on rolling out blockchain ticketing. In the coming years we will likely see NFT tickets for sorts games in the NBA and the MLB\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.sportico.com/business/tech/2021/seatgeek-nft-prototype-nfl-nba-1234626903/\r  \n\r  \nNFT ticketing in crypto is still a very niche market. However due to the adoption in the coming years and the fact that traditional ticketing companies also see the value in NFT ticketing I expect NFT ticketing projects to gain siginifiantly in price and marketcap. The most promising NFT ticketing project with the highest adoption is GET Protocol. GET protocol has already sold 700k tickets on the blockchain and has whitelabel solution that allows ticketing companies to easily adopt the protocol. So far 5 ticketing companies have integrated the GET protocol.\r  \n\r  \nRead more here https://cryp2gem.medium.com/get-protocol-research-by-cryp2gem-727ac0d2c332",

            "text": "Ask yourself one question, why do you want money? Yep that's a serious question\u2026.. why does nearly everyone in the world want money?\n\nThat\u2019s right..... to pay for things that they want to buy!\n\nBe that a house, a car, a holiday, a new PS4 game, some McDonalds, a new jacket, a watch maybe\u2026.. whatever. But fundamentally you want money to **buy things**. It\u2019s as simple as that.\n\nAsk yourself another question. Why do people invest?\n\nTo make **more money**\u2026.. they hope that the value of their investment increases, which hopefully creates more money which you can then\u2026..yep you guessed it\u2026.buy more of the things you want.\n\nSo let\u2019s look at the current situation. The entire market is tanking\u2026.. we now have literally thousands of virtual currencies to choose from.\n\nRemember that 95% of people have spent most of their life getting by just fine with just one currency. Admittedly it has its flaws. It\u2019s centralised, it can be manipulated by government or large companies. It can be subject to inflation and deflation, and quite frankly it\u2019s archaic.\n\nSo \"crypto\"-currencies can be a good thing\u2026\u2026 They tackle a lot of the issues we have with fiat, and quite frankly, it drags us all kicking and screaming into the 21st century. It\u2019s definitely a good thing to have virtual currencies. In fact it\u2019s not even a bad thing to have \u201cmultiple\u201d virtual currencies\u2026\u2026but do we really need thousands of them?\n\nOf course we don\u2019t!\n\nSo why have people been buying them all? Simple\u2026\u2026 to make **MORE MONEY**!\n\nI used to read articles about crypto being the world\u2019s biggest pyramid scheme, and I shrugged it off an ignored it, because I believe in the tech and believe that crypto and blockchain has a massive part to play in this world (I still do!) but it\u2019s at times like this where you actually start to understand what the naysayers meant by this.\n\nIf you bought a crypto and you didn\u2019t 100% believe in what it was offering to the world, and you didn\u2019t 100% believe that it served a real-world purpose, then it must have been because you just wanted to make money from it. You didn\u2019t understand it\u2026\u2026you literally couldn\u2019t give a shit about what it was or what it was offering\u2026..you just wanted its value to increase so that you could sell it onto someone else to make a profit.\n\nThat\u2019s it. Get rid of it, and let the last person holding it deal with the crap. It\u2019s a \"dog-eat-dog\" capitalist world and I understand that you have to put yourself first. We\u2019ve all done it. But just like any good pyramid scheme, you\u2019ll eventually run out of people to sell the crap to\u2026..they start to smell it from a mile away, and they won\u2019t touch it with a 10ft barge-pole!\n\nLet me give you an example of how ridiculous the current market is\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll take a random coin purely to use as an example\u2026..\n\nLet's take Aston (ATX) \u2013 This one has just caught my eye on CoinMarketCap, because in the midst of the crypto shit-storm it\u2019s actually up 17% right now, so it sticks out like a sore thumb!\n\nIt's doing really well, so must be one of the \"good\" crypto's right? The one that's really helping push crypto and blockchain tech to the masses. The shining beacon in the fog.\n\nWell let\u2019s take a look at their home page\u2026..\n\nI quote directly from the hom page,\n\n*Aston is a completely decentralized platform for Document Authentication that built with innovative blockchain technology X.Blockchain and the premier security solution Smart-Pass-On. Any documents that you think should be issued or submitted in hardcopy format will be lost through the Aston.*\n\nOk honestly\u2026..someone\u2026\u2026 please tell me\u2026..WTF does that even mean??\n\nSo my docs will be \u201clost through the Aston\u201d will they?\n\nHere\u2019s another snippet\u2026..\n\n*\u201cWhen you need proof of documentation in real life, all information about that document is existed in the Aston and you can experience easier transactions and document processing with simple authentication. Aston is preparing for a new document revolution that can make dreams come true.\u201d*\n\nSo my dreams will come true because Aston is preparing for a document revolution? Wow\u2026\u2026OK\u2026\u2026 well I have literally no idea what these guys are doing, but it sounds kind of cool, in a \u201cI've no idea what the hell they are talking about\u201d kind of way. Let\u2019s invest!\n\nOK so we have a market cap of $20m dollars for the company\u2026.. actually trading close to an all-time low, so definitely worth investing right? After all, this company had a market cap of $40m dollars only 6 weeks ago! Now is the time to get in right?\n\nSo yeah at $20m market cap, half of what is was a short time ago.....It\u2019s a steal right?\n\nWell I'm no fool, and I need to do my due dilligence, so I at least want to know what this is all about before I spend my money.\n\nLet me check out how this works\u2026.it mentions documents on the blockchain so maybe it\u2019s some kind of futuristic \u201cdrop-box\u201d type company maybe? Sounds cool! Everyone knows drop-box so this could be huge!\n\nIs there a login or registration page where I can start uploading my docs?\n\nNo.\n\nIs there an app or some software I can download to my computer to see this Aston thingy working?\n\nNo.\n\nWait a minute....so how did you guys value yourself at $40m?\n\nWell it takes a lot of money to run a multi-million dollar company stupid!!\n\nAh right I forgot about that. They must've already spent a fortune just getting this thing off the ground.\n\nFor a start, they must\u2019ve spent maybe $2000 on this website\u2026It\u2019s kind of slick and the graphics are moving around in the background. It\u2019s definitely better than what I could conjure up with my basic HTML/CSS/JS skills.\n\nLike I say, a \u201cproper\u201d web-designer probably took a whole week to make this\u2026..so yeah there\u2019s $2000 for a top web-designer right there.\n\nWhat else? Oh yeah I forgot, the whitepaper! A document that starts of as a word doc and then gets converted to a PDF. That must\u2019ve take at least a week or two to write all that stuff that makes no sense\u2026\u2026 and people who write stuff that makes no sense need paying right?\n\nOk so that's probably another $2000 spent on a whitepaper\n\nWhat else?\n\nOh yeah website hosting\u2026.. that\u2019s not cheap! Some ISP's charge $100 a month! That\u2019s $1200 a year that needs paying for!\n\nWhat else?\n\nThe domain name\u2026\u2026 that\u2019s $30 right there!\n\nOh yeah, I almost forgot....the actual crypto tokens!\n\nThat's where all the money must've been spent getting this project off the ground!\n\nIt must\u2019ve taken significant investment to develop right?\n\nWell let\u2019s take a look\u2026. Here\u2019s the Etherscan link to view the token contract code: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a0f2ab46ec630f9fd638029027b552afa64b94c#code](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a0f2ab46ec630f9fd638029027b552afa64b94c#code)\n\nIt\u2019s valid ERC20 \u2013 that\u2019s good. What else can we tell from the code?\n\nWell if we look at line 21 of the code we can see mention of TokenController.sol \u2026.. hmm that sounds familiar\u2026.It\u2019s like I\u2019ve seen that before somewhere\u2026\u2026anyway will keep looking.\n\nLines 48-51 give it away\u2026..\n\n// File: contracts/token/MiniMeToken.sol\n\n/\\*\n\nCopyright 2016, Jordi Baylina\n\nAhhhhh\u2026\u2026 so it\u2019s basically a free smart contract template that\u2019s been adapted based on the original smart contract by Jordi Baylina! ([https://github.com/Giveth/minime](https://github.com/Giveth/minime))\n\nNow I should state that there\u2019s nothing wrong with this template \u2013 Jordi Baylina is a very talented solidity programmer, and his contract code is excellent\u2026..but the point is that by making a few changes here and there to the template, you can very quickly and very easily adapt it to your own token contract. I\u2019m literally talking an hours work\u2026..I\u2019m serious\u2026\u2026 1 hours work, and it costs nothing to adjust.\n\nSo let\u2019s pull this all together\u2026\u2026\n\nAston have probably spent around $8-10k on a website, a domain, hosting and a whitepaper (and by the way, I\u2019m being uber generous with the numbers here!)\n\nThey also spent somewhere in the region of one hour, and around $1 in Ethereum gas fees deploying their contract onto the Ethereum main-net block-chain.\n\nSo what do we value this company at?\u2026.. that\u2019s right guys, $40 million!\n\nYou\u2019re kidding right? \u2026..nope. Some people really did invest that amount of money in this company.\n\nLet\u2019s step outside of this crypto bubble for a second\u2026..only for a second because we all know how warm and cosy it is inside\u2026.. let\u2019s just pretend for a minute that you owned a big investment company, and a guy who you don't know from Adam, comes to you with a 20-page PDF, and some crazy idea about how he will make your dreams come true by putting your docs through his \u201cAston\u201d and asks you for some money. What would you value this company at?\n\nLet me tell you if it was me\u2026\u2026 if I\u2019d been drinking heavily that day, and I was in a really happy, relaxed mood, and I was feeling crazy generous because I had so much money to play with that I didn't know what to do with it.....and I actually really liked this guy and his Aston doc swallowing concept\u2026\u2026 I\u2019d maybe stretch to $50k for a 50% stake in the company\u2026..maybe $100k at a push if I thought this whole aston doc revolution thingy was just too cool to let go.\n\nWould I value the company at $40m? .......errr\n\nWell some people thought that was exactly the amount the company was worth\u2026..And they happily they sent their hard-earned money off to Aston, just as they did to plenty of other ICO's, and the global market cap of crypto's increased, and everyone onboard the crypto train was smiling from ear to ear. Isn't buying altcoins great!\n\nSo what did Aston do with the Eth?\n\nI could hazard a guess\u2026..The small part in me that's see the good in all people thinks that they\u2019re probably spending the millions of dollars making the company strong, helping them to get ready to deliver their promise of making dreams come true.\n\nThey certainly wouldn\u2019t be doing what the cynic in me is thinking would they? As in, dumping all that Eth onto various exchanges trying to convert it into real money that they could go and buy things with\u2026..They wouldn't do that to us would they?\n\nAnyhow, maybe I'm being harsh on Aston....maybe they are a great company, and their doc-swallowing concept really will revolutionize the world we live in...... Apologies if you own these coins, the truth is I didn't do a ton of research on them, I just plucked them randomly from CMC to make a point.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get across to you all is that this is just one of THOUSANDS of ICO's that had BILLIONS of dollars thrown at them over the last year or so...... and when people stop and think for a moment as to whether or not it's a good idea to throw more money at more new crazy ICO ideas, and yet everyone currently holding Aston tokens (and all the thousands of others) sit there wondering WTF is going on, and why their investments are going down??\n\nPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stop buying all these sh1tcoins!!! Do everyone a favour and let them go!!\n\nOnly then can the crypto market truly recover.",

The model helps build trust and increase user adoption within the DeFi community.\n\nThis method is called \u201cSustainable Token Model\u201d or STM for short.\n\nThe premise of STM is simple: new tokens should hold around 30% equity in the total supply of their tokens.\n\nThis internal pool of funds, is NOT to be sold, but instead HELD \u2014 yielding proceeds continuously, from the redistributions of other transactions.\n\nThe yields on this internal pool are then batched periodically, in small quantities, to fund operating expenses such as new marketing campaigns, coin listings, project expansion and continued dev costs.\n\nAnother critical part of the STM method is to have a fully \u2018doxxed dev\u2019 from Day 1. This means that the developer and owner of the project is to share their name, LinkedIn account, selfies, videos and essentially be publicly responsible for the path of the new token.\n\nBubblegum Founder (and fully doxxed dev from the USA) James Wolf believes that as they prove the STM method to be successful, other legit new tokens will follow suit by implementing the STM method into their own token.\n\n\u201cThe number of rug pulls happening right now is absurd. We need a better system to help end, or at least slow down, the sheer number of rug pulls happening on a daily basis. The STM methodology we established provides a superior model to launching and maintaining a sustainable token over time. We hope more tokens will employ this method for success\u201d, James explains in his recent live AMA on Twitch.\n\nBeyond having just a new token, the Bubblegum team is planning the launch of a new DeFi dapp (under the same name and brand of Bubblegum), which users will be able to connect their wallet to for tracking assets & unique wallet analytics. The launch of this new dapp is scheduled for Q3 / Q4 of 2021.\n\nTo learn more about $Bubblegum and for all the trading details and links, visit the website at [https://bubblegum.life](https://bubblegum.life/)",

            "text": "**Q1.** **All fees will be used to buy SLT with a buy bot. 33% SLT will be redistributed among SLT holders and the remaining SLT will be used for the company. To run the company expenses have to be made, and I don't think you can pay everything with SLT. So most of the 66% have to be sold to run the platform.**  \n\n**My question is: Wouldn't that create more selling pressure than buying pressure? Because everyone is talking about the amazing buying pressure the buy bot will create, but most of SLT will be sold again afterwards right?**  \n\n*MB: Good question, yes sure some of the fee income will have to be turned into cash to pay bills but it will not \"most\" of the 66% as you suggest. Smartlands will hold its profits from trading activities in SLT.*  \n\n*Also it is worth bearing in mind the more listings and business we generate the more profits we will make while the operating costs of the company are largely fixed. We don't have factories and fleets of company cars for example and most of the expenditure to create Smartlands has already been incurred and amortized.*  \n\n**Q2.** **I recently introduced Smartlands to my relatives and common questions I received that I couldn't give a solid answer to from them are these:**  \n\n1. **Is Smartlands Network currently only interested in larger, more expensive real estate since their current model ( $5k listing fee and 5% of all capital raised) has a greater incentive towards more expensive properties due to the fixed listing fee? (What factors does this have on the number of properties that could be listed?)**  \n2. **Once Smartlands begins to take off in regards to properties being listed, will there be a way for people listing their property to market/advertise it on the network, to ensure its own tokens get bought up?**  \n\n*MB: Smartlands will be interested in almost all types of property but yes you are correct, Smartlands is not designed for someone to sell their $30k studio flat out in the suburbs.*  \n\n*Initially we are focused on commercial property, being warehouses, offices, shopping malls and high end residential properties.*  \n\n*Bearing this in mind the fee structure is not expensive when considering the costs of obtaining commercial loans / mortgages or floating on a stock exchange.*  \n\n*The platform is designed for asset holders to tokenize a percentage of their asset to raise cash flow for their own purposes it is not designed to replace real estate agents although of course if a property owner wanted a complete exit we would look at each opportunity on its own merits.*  \n\n**Q3.** **I would like to know if you worry about the Russian aggression at the border and if a conflict could effect Smartlands business?**  \n\n*MB: I have lived in Ukraine for more than 12 years so obviously I am not worried about Russia. The area of interest to Russia is around 1,000 KMs away and so there is no chance that it could affect Smartland's business.*  \n\n**Q4.** **Hotdogs or hamburgers?**  \n\n*MB: Hamburgers with cheddar cheese*  \n\n**Q5.** **One thing I\u2019m wondering is whether crypto/blockchain policies in the UK could potentially affect your business in Ukraine. The UK is a major global banking hub and is likely to be deeply involved in assessing the threats and opportunities to their power structure that blockchain and cryptocurrency represent.**   \n\n**By contrast, Ukraine seems to be seizing on the opportunity to be world leaders in integrating blockchain on a societal level. I am wondering if there are any specific instances in which policies in the two countries are incongruent. If so, could specific policies (or lack thereof) in the UK affect what you guys are doing in Ukraine?**  \n\n*MB: In the UK we have a regulated holding company but as with most international companies the laws and regulations of one jurisdiction will not affect operations in another.*  \n\n*We will need to wait for the UK to catch up with Ukraine but even when it does each Smartlands company subsidiary will operate under the laws of which ever country it is based in.*  \n\n*So I see no threats to Smartlands from the UK legal situation.*  \n\n**Q6.** **Can you provide us more information as to how fees would be generated on the Agroxy platform? Without going into specifics, will there be fees for listing assets, buying assets, selling assets, or a combination of those?**  \n\n*MB: Very simply with Agroxy their platform generates fees, Smartlands supplies the backend technology and blockchain solution and takes a percentage of each fee that Agroxy generates. Specific numbers will be confirmed in due course.*  \n\n**Q7.** **Do you guys have a short paragraph that you feel clearly explains what SLT aims to do in a way that someone with a very basic understanding of crypto could understand it?**  \n\n*MB: Yes send them a copy of my article ... Ukraine and the fee pool explained.*  \n\n[*The Fee Pool and Ukraine Explained - Smartlands*](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/)   \n\n**Q8.** **If a person tokenizes a piece of real estate (let's just say an apartment) and he holds 100% of the tokens for that apartment, does that mean he is the 100% legal owner of the apartment?**  \n\n**If he sells all those tokens to person b, does that make them the legal owner now?**  \n\n*MB:* *Yes because the ownership is defined by the blockchain. Each token is represented by the real asset held with a custodian.*  \n\n**Q9.** **Smartlands recently tweeted about its first-mover advantage in the tokenization space. I\u2019m curious about the nature and significance of that advantage. As far as I know, Smartlands has an edge because it\u2019s already launched a successful pilot project in the U.K., and, more recently, finalized the legal framework to launch its alternative investment platform in Ukraine.**  \n\n**But in terms of expanding beyond Ukraine, how exactly will these factors give Smartlands a headstart against competing tokenization projects? Is it mainly because (assuming everything goes smoothly) Smartlands will have experience in navigating the relevant/cumbersome legal hurdles? Or is it because Smartlands will be an established name in the tokenization space? Something else?**  \n\n*MB: We will be able to show a proven operating entity that generates benefits for both investors and asset owners which should be more attractive than any new or untried competing platform.*  \n\n**Q10.** **What is your long term vision for SLT, say in like 5-10 years? Do you see yourself expanding to the Americas and Asia in that timespan? As for the short term, all of us are excited for the platform going live and the T1 exchange listing of course, but what else are you currently working on and are excited to share with us?**  \n\n*MB: We are working on numerous projects outside the Smartlands platform where our blockchain solutions can add value to a client's business.*  \n\n*We will look at any and every opportunity where we can see the potential to generate fees and thus create more demand for SLT as all fees are only accepted by Smartlands in SLT.*  \n\n**Q11.** **Currently, the sole role of SLT is to collect fees and provide revenue for both holders and Smartlands.** **Are there any plans in the future to add value to it such as:**  \n\n**- Governance**  \n\n**- Listing & Trading fee discounts**  \n\n**- Loaning**  \n\n*IO: Hi! Thanks for asking us this question.*  \n\n*At first, we think that fees will generate enough demand for the token, however incentivizing holders is the important part of the equation, guaranteeing that the demand on average will be higher than the supply.*  \n\n*In our UK launch in 2019, we had active the policy to reduce the fee rate for the large holders, and that is something we can turn on quickly, however need to come up with the right balance.*  \n\n*The governance aspect is also quite important, and in the Smartlands Wallet, this function is already implemented (as a certain thing - SLT holders will decide on the minimum staking value and other staking rules.*  \n\n*We're also always considering other options and may introduce other mechanics as well.*  \n\n**Q12.** **My question relates to the fee redistribution model. It has come to the attention of myself and other members of the community that the amount of tokens to achieve the required staking value of 1000 \u20ac could change quite dramatically over the course of a few days. It is not unfeasible, for example, that one week you could require one (1) $SLT token to achieve the minimum staking balance requirement \u2013 and the next week you might require three (3) or more $SLT Tokens to achieve the same staking balance requirement. How do you plan to address this disparity should or when this situation comes up? If fees are planned to be paid monthly \u2013 it would not be unfeasible for someone to achieve the staking balance requirement for 50% or more of the month in question. Will there be a way to lock in the 1000 \u20ac value based on current/present set value?**  \n\n*IO: The technicalities around the staking is an important aspect, especially since we decided to lock the value in fiat.*  \n\n*The process is implemented in our platform in the way that at the beginning of each month the minimum amount of SLT tokens required for staking is fixed for the entire month, and the holder needs to lock these tokens in the smart contract, effectively reducing the supply. If the holder withdraws the token from the staking contract before the end of the month - he will receive no rewards in that period.*  \n\n\u00ad\u00ad**Q13.** **Since some SDF nodes went down last week causing issues with transactions, even though the system worked as intended and the blockchain remained secure, are you planning on running your own node to avoid downtime on the Smartlands platform?**  \n\n*IO: Own node in the Stellar Network is an integral part of our regulated environment solution. Especially because we're relying on our custom-built Horizon server implementation.*  \n\n*We already were operating the node since 2018 and up to the summer of 2020, and will bring it back online very soon.*  \n\n**Q14.** **I notice that Stellar has moved further along with their smart contracts (TSS). How involved has Smartlands been with the finalizing of this protocol (if at all)? Do you have plans of implementing it?**  \n\n*IO: Our regulated environment is based on plain stellar smart contracts (multi-sig, pre-signed txs, etc.)*  \n\n*With the upcoming relaunch of the platform, we plan to use additional concepts, such as payment channels, escrow, etc., and in time will move from a multi-sig scheme to TSS.*  \n\n*Overall we appreciate the recent developments of the Stellar Protocol towards the smart contracts, and protocols for regulated assets since it will allow us to improve the decentralization of our ecosystem, even though our solution was and will be always non-custodial.*  \n\n**Q15.** **I would like to ask about the staff:**  \n\n* **How many team members do you have at the moment?**  \n* **Are you planning to expand in the near future, and what roles are expected to be filled?**  \n* **Is the current company size sufficient to keep up with the upcoming events?**  \n\n*IO: The core of the Smartlands team yet stays the same - 15 people, and we have very close partnerships with a number of IT development companies in Ukraine, who're responsible for our platform tech along with the tech for our JVs and customers.*  \n\n*This team is well built and certainly will meet all the short and mid-term goals, however in light of the upcoming launch on the retail market we will significantly expand the customer support and retail sales, call-center in particular.*  \n\n**Q16.** **Two questions for you:**  \n\n1. **Is there a native support for the Stellar wallet within Ledger live planned? Just like they have one for Erc-20 tokens within the Ethereum wallet.**  \n2. **Can we expect a Fiat onramp for the SLT token like a SLT/ \u20ac or $ pairing on a exchange? (Not meaning stablecoins but real fiat).**  \n\n*IO: I won't be able to answer now about the Ledger live, however regarding the second part - we consider fiat integration into our platform as the crucial aspect for the mass adoption.*  \n\n*In the beginning, we certainly will have fiat transactions with security tokens, then roll-out card payments support to accommodate retail needs. This certainly will be enough to provide the demand from the fiat market into our SLT token, however, we will also consider bringing the real fiat into native crypto transactions too.*  \n\n*And I wouldn't underestimate the stablecoin market, since with our solution we will not be limited to the Stellar stablecoin market and plan to provide a reliable and convenient way to cross-chain swap USDC from the Ethereum network.*  \n\n**Q17.** **Do the asset backed RE tokens that are listed on the platform have a time limit for how long they remain listed on the platform? Say I own a commercial property and I wanted to tokenize 30% of it on Smartlands... Would I be able to put conditions like: I want to offer this tokenized portion on the Smartlands platform for 2 years, after which I would buy back the tokens from the holders? Or is it a case of the assets being listed will be listed for an indefinite period of time? In the case it's the latter, are there any concerns about the asset backed tokens on the platform being 'lost' due to inactive investors/unforeseen loss of access to the tokens?**  \n\n*IO: Our Platform is a flexible tool, that can accommodate every potential scenario and features of the underlying securities.*  \n\n*Among them, buy-backs and other guarantees are a very demanding aspect.*  \n\n*Regarding the second part of the question - the tokens in the wallet will remain the tokens in the wallet even if the asset is delisted from the secondary market, and all the rights associated with the security will of course remain in force for the entire lifespan of the security (potentially for the indefinite period).*  \n\n*MB: RE backed tokens are backed by property and so have a very long life.*  \n\n*If you did float 30% of an asset on Smartlands and wanted to buy the asset back you would have to go to the platform and place some bids*  \n\n**Q18.** **Ilia I remember you from the old days as investors. What made you realize the potential in smartlands and push to where you are now?**  \n\n**Martin- what about Smartlands made you want to be a part of the team?**  \n\n*MB: I could see multiple instances of where Smartlands could be of benefit to my existing client base.*  \n\n**Q19.** **Thank you for this second AMA.**  \n\n1. **The vision of Smartlands is to build a investment banking solution for also the everyday person. Does this still include the Smartee solution with a debit card? Something like Wirex is doing?**  \n2. **Does the Smartlands Wallet include KYC/AML (I guess so) and also protection against hack, theft etc (as it was in the former if I remember correctly)?**  \n\n*IO:* *Smartee project is currently on hold since the institutional investors are in the priority for our business. However the retail part is crucially important, and we will be striving to easy access to investments for the retail people. Although credit card payments may solve this aspect to a major extent. We also looking to partner with existing retail neobanks and payment processors to wider the ecosystem and potentially be included in the major banks' marketplaces. We may also resume the Smartee project if we will see the strong demand for Smartlands own card solution.*  \n\n*KYC in Smartlands Wallet is still optional, and it's only mandatory once the investor decides to invest in securities, or the AML engine is triggered. However, you're right that having passed KYC gives a bonus of potential wallet recovery in the worst scenario of losing the private key.*  \n\n**Q20.** **Colliers is listed on the website as a partner, are you able to tell us more about this partnership and how it relates to the new platform? The link goes to their Ukraine website, are you working with them on properties in Ukraine?**  \n\n*MB: Yes Smartlands has a partnership with Colliers in Lithuania which was put in place by the previous CEO.*  \n\n*Colliers globally has expressed a great real of interest in what we are doing and once the platform is up and running and the new Digital Asset Laws are passed in Ukraine then we fully expect to be able to work with Colliers on some of their commercial and high-end residential real estate projects.*  \n\n**Q21.** **What happens if the project/development being funded through the Smartlands Network fails and is unable to pay back the funds borrowed?**  \n\n*MB: The funds are not borrowed but sold.*  \n\n*An asset holder would sell a percentage of his equity on the platform and on selling it would no longer own it the purchaser would own it and would be able to sell it themselves on the platform when they wish.*  \n\n**Q22.** **How are you planning to secure liquidity on the secondary market? To me it looks like the SLT token is a much better investment than Security Tokens right now. And how much of the total fees generated by the platform will the secondary market cover?**  \n\n*IO: The liquidity on the secondary market for security tokens is a crucial thing, and we have it covered :)*  \n\n*SLT token and security tokens are two dramatically different asset classes. Security tokens backed by real estate for example represent to a major extent one of the most secure potential investment classes; SMEs and startups - will be the risky asset class, though still less risky than cryptocurrencies; and SLT tokens - is a utility token with the intrinsic value derived from the constant fee demand.*  \n\n**Q23.** **Question for Martin.** **You have a traditional finance background. How and when did you become interested in crypto? And how did you get involved with Smartlands?**  \n\n*MB: One of the investors in Smartlands suggested the team at Empire State Capital Partners might be able to offer some assistance and so we look at Smartlands and agreed with him and here we are.*  \n\n*As to being interested in Crypto I like trading screens having been a eurobond trader in my youth*.  \n\n**Q24.** **Will the asset issuer be able to 'loan' his equity, meaning will he be able to buy it back at a certain cost with interest, or he has to go through the secondary market?** **Will it be a choice: Loan or Sell?** **In the case of a loan, am I correct to view it as a pawn shop?**  \n\n*MB: The secondary market.* *On selling a percentage on the platform it will be owned by someone else and if he wants it back the original owner will have to place a bid on our platform.*  \n\n**Q25.** **Currently REIT's and other investment funds make large profits from real estate investments. Where do you see the main opposition to what Smartlands is trying to achieve as no doubt Smartlands tokenisation of assets will impact the profits of traditional investors?**  \n\n*MB: Traditional REITS are usually huge running into billions of dollars.* *Smartlands will bring the benefits of a REIT to much smaller property or portfolio owners.*  \n\n**Q26.** **What is the single biggest concern potential investors had with the platform (regulatory/operational/legal/etc...) and how do you plan to rectify that concern?**  \n\n*IO: I would say, that the biggest concern is \"operational\" and lying around the integration of tokenized assets into the traditional capital markets infrastructure, ability to put assets into collateral; and to the lesser extent - \"legal\", considering the overall government's position on the blockchain.*  \n\n**Q27.** **Would you ever consider opening up the platform to project incubation? For example using it to partially fund a movie or startup in exchange for a stake in profits? Or do the assets being staked need to be fully realized/accountable before hand?**  \n\n*MB: Yes, we are investigating multiple opportunities.* *Only last week I spoke at a conference on NFTs for example.* *However first we are starting with real estate because it is relatively straight forward.*  \n\n**Q28.** **Which one of your partnerships are you most excited about? Also, do you have new partnerships that are in work and that we can expect in a somewhat near future?**  \n\n*MB: We have many new JVs and partnerships we are working on right now and as soon as an LOI or even an MOU is signed we will be proudly informing you all about them.*  \n\n**Q29.** **How much do we need to worry about the build-up of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border as reported by CNN this morning?**  \n\n*MB: Not at all. There has been Russian military on Ukraine's border for years.* *I think they might be frightened of us!*  \n\n**Q30.** **I just want to know if someone does tokenize their building or whatever asset on your platform then what exactly is the incentive of someone buying into that? Could they buy it and sell it later for more due to rarity or property value increases? Or will you be receiving a percentage of the revenue based on how much you're invested?**  \n\n*MB: They will own a percentage of the asset. So they will be entitled to a pro-rata share of the rental income and a pro-rata share of any capital gains which will be reflected in the price of the token on the platform.*  \n\n*IO:* *It mostly depends on the asset class, however, if we talk about equity as the most popular asset class - it is basically a share of the ownership of the project, and grants rights to the share of the* *profit, share of the company capital, voting rights, etc. As a real-world example - it is like owning 1/1000 of your nearest shopping mall and receiving the corresponding share of rental income.*  \n\n*And of course, there will be a secondary market for these tokens to sell the stake, potentially with the price appreciation.*  \n\n**Q31.** **Will Smartlands consider non-profit ventures? Conservation type investments? Saving/protecting land?**  \n\n*MB:* *Yes in due course but I would prefer to look at managed forestry for example to produce a return rather than financing a retreat for aged tortoises on its own.*  \n\n**Q32.** **In the future if the platform is successful and there is a great number of ABT\u2019s and properties interested in working with Smartlands, would there be groupings of real estate that would fall under 1 token?**  \n\n*MB: We are looking at creating multiple fund structures to spread investor risk across multiple asset classes.*  \n\n*IO: It is a good idea in general, and we certainly may come up and most probably will implement such type of \"index funds\", however, on the long run we also consider the idea of non-custodial auto-invest bringing a balanced customized portfolio according to the preferences of every individual investor, more like \"being your own index fund\" :)*  \n\n**Q33.** **Can you give a quick rundown of what's in plan for Smartlands, short and long term?**  \n\n*IO: We will release the ecosystem roadmap very soon, and will also put more light on the Alternative Investment Platform project road. We had done small tuning to our plan for this year, and now it is even more ambitious :)*  \n\n*As a small insight - we plan to roll out a full-featured mobile app for the mass market end of this year or early next year, and DeFi loans against security tokens in collateral also next year.*  \n\n**Q34.** **Is there any plans to further address the outdated Network site ? And is it neccessary to hold both sites active?**  \n\n*IO: The website is already partially updated and doesn't have outdated info. We will also roll out the next portion of the content and visual updates this week.*  \n\n*To shed some light on the near future - we're currently planning the major redesign/repositioning of our brand and all our websites and apps.*  \n\n**Q35.** **What do you consider the greatest achievement of the company?**  \n\n*IO:* *Being the first in the world who tokenized the equity available to purchase for retail investors. But of course, the bigger achievements are yet to come.*  \n\n**Q36.** **If someone tokenizes an asset and then sells a portion of it, will the investors buying the tokens be buying SLT tokens or something else? Why will someone want to buy these tokens what will be the advantage of owning them, what will they get?**  \n\n*MB:* *No the investors will be buying ICOs on that particular asset or property, the fees for such a transaction will be paid in SLT.*  \n\n**Q37.** **Is there any mechanism to protect investors on the platform from losses that exceed the capital invested, and how will this be covered by your due diligence when opportunities are added to the platform?**  \n\n*IO:* *This aspect is covered, and since in most cases the investment will be taken into the company that owns the property, the potential liability is limited to the value of the investment.*  \n\n**Q38.** **What makes Smartlands unique compared to other similar projects?**  \n\n*IO: Thanks for the question, and for the ability to conduct such a great AMA. We're impressed with the number of questions :)*  \n\n*Regarding our positioning, I can say that to the most extent we compete not with the \"blockchains for tokenized assets\", but with the way how people invest now.*  \n\n*And consequently, that's also how we unique in the crypto space - we operate our own licensed financial companies and market the investment opportunities. And we also developing our ecosystem, to fulfil the long-term vision of a decentralized digital investment bank.*  \n\n**Thank you Ilia, Martin and the rest of the Smartlands team \u2013 we look forward to what comes next!**  \n\n**Oh wait\u2026 there was one last thing\u2026 answered in the Telegram afterward:**  \n\n**Q39.** **Any update on the platform launch date?**  \n\n*IO: It's coming :) isn't it obvious? ;)*   \n\n*Compiled by 320prophecy*",

NFTs have been a hot topic of late and DeFi has been cemented its space in not just the crypto world, but traditional market spheres as well. However, genesis shards marries both these ideas into a single, unified concept.\n\nGenesis shards is a decentralized ecosystem powered by Polkadot that redefines NFTs as DeFi options, creating a permissionless environment of interchain liquidity for pre-IDO tokens. What this means is that Genesis shards wrapps time-locked fungible tokens into NFTs which in turn can create a new market for previously illiquid tokens.\n\nUsers can efficiently and safely gain access to and trade pre-IDO tokens, while projects can leverage token liquidity early in the life cycle, build strong community support early on in their journey, and also get a sense of price discovery. This is done by essentially \u201cNFT-ing\u201d the OTC market: transforming NFTs into a liquidity vehicle for pre-IDO tokens.\n\nUnlocking a new frontier in DeFi: A Pre-IDO marketplace on nonfungible tokens\nThe whole idea is pretty ingenious. When new tokens are released, they are pretty illiquid. Genesis shards use NFT wrappers to separate circulating tokens which have the added benefit of allowing easy price discovery and launchpad style crowd exposure. These NFTs could also contain pre-IDO tokens which can later be swapped for Post iDO tokens.\n\nGenShards is all about enabling \u201cPre-IDO\u201d liquidity \u2014 and this is made possible through the Gen Ticket NFTs. At the most basic level, Gen tickets are NFT contracts that represent a varying amount of pre-IDO tokens. These NFTs can be traded on a compatible exchange or can be exchanged for the IDO tokens at the time of token generation events.\n\nIn the near future, projects will be able to launch their own GenTickets on the Genesis Shards platform \u2014 and gain access to pre-IDO liquidity for their tokens!\nThe system is made up of 4 key components namely, Gen Access, Gen Tickets, Gen NFTC, and $GS token. $GS token is the utility token for the whole ecosystem which can be swapped for elements like Gen Access which users the entry into the Gen ecosystem.\n\nSome of the biggest names in the crypto investing sphere have partaken in its funding rounds. They had raised $2.7M from funds like 3Commas, Block Dream Fund by OKEx,  Morningstar, Moonwhale Ventures, Master Ventures, Petrock Capital.  \n\nIt was also supported by angel investors like Santiago Roel Santos of Parafi Capital; Sandeep Nailwal = Polygon; Danish Chaudhry, CEO of Bitcoin.com, etc. Its founder is Garlam Won. Garlam was behind the marketing of some of the most successful projects including Harmony, Sandbox, MANTRADAO and more\nGenesis Shards is having its first-ever dual IDO on Polkastarter wherein it will be available in both Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. \n\nBut they haven't announced the date. It will most likely be in the next few days and I encourage every one of you here to keep your notifications on. This will be one of the biggest launches of the year and is certain to go straight to the moon.",

            "text": " Zenon is implementing a fully decentralized dual-coin mechanism. The coinmetrics are designed to achieve a Mint-Burn equilibrium for ZNN and QSR as the first dual-coin architecture of its kind.The first use-case of NoM would be to power decentralized infrastructure services that will support further development of next-gen web3 applications. The hybrid applications built on Zenon will fall under a variety of use-cases, covering anything from decentralized storage solutions to DeFi or IoT.\n\nWhat is it:\n\nIncredibly fast, almost infinitely scalable state-of-the-art DLT. It combines the block-lattice architecture that was first(?) used by Raiblocks/Nano with a DAG that exists as a separate layer for the consensus. The block-lattice handles the transactions. It's going to be used to scale Web3 dapps as a L1, and also process transactions as a L2 chain.\n\nWho does it:\n\nThis is an independent, open-source project and will probably be run by a foundation similar to Ethereum and Cardano, but I'm about 99.5% sure its backed by Square. I can enumerate the zillions of times they have hinted as such if I really have to here, but you can search for old biz posts on Zenon here and also on Warosu.\n\nSquare will likely use it to scale Bitcoin transactions where the default payment for merchants and Cashapp users is made in BTC, and then they can set it to dollars or pounds or whatever afterwards.\n\nIts open source and not owned by Square, like how Node.js isn't owned by Google but has wide adoption. They'll easily recruit 1000s of legacy web apps for this bc no code changes are needed, and also dapps on Ethereum will easily switch over.\n\nTestnet is live and not very public yet. Large exchanges expect payment, and/or the coin to already be established within the cryptosphere. Also you can earn passive income on your [$ZNN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ZNN&src=cashtag_click) Avg 55% APY. No need to send it anywhere stake it yourself on your own pc.",

            "text": "The recent attack and fallout from the 51% attack on Zcoin / FIRO has received a lot of buzz recently.  However, many are unaware of just how bad what Zcoin / FIRO is going to  do is for every other decentralized project. The precedent they are  setting\u200a\u2014\u200ascreams centralized authoritarian decision making, caving to  centralized exchanges demands and highlights the necessity of having  SOLID blockchain developers, as attacks and mishandling of the followups  puts individuals\u2019 cryptocurrency (funds) at grave risk. Beyond this,  their sweeping decision screams centralized control and set a standard  to exchanges that anytime there is an attack, that it is encumbent upon  the projects to refund lost amounts.\n\nExchanges run a business. Many blockchain projects do as well, however, many are  run by a community, or DAO, or DAC. Blockchains, while many have come a  long way, still may present bugs, and worse yet, some do not have  quality active development, putting these projects into a very high-risk  category, where users\u2019 funds are on the verge of being lost or inflated  to oblivion.\n\nHowever,  for those active, high quality, decentralized projects, when an attack  occurs, putting the onus on the project itself to cover any lost revenue  from an exchange is a VERY interesting dilemma. Yes, the project gets  the benefit of having their project on a CEX for exposure, inroads for  use, etc. However, the exchange makes significant amounts of money  (upfront listing fees sometimes in the millions, transaction fees,  counter trading order books, market making, and the list goes on).  Projects don\u2019t ever see any of these profits or revenues. Thus, when an  exchange suffers a loss, to then demand a project pony up is a hard pill  to swallow.\n\nBut  that\u2019s not the main point here. Let\u2019s look at what happened with Zcoin /  FIRO, what the 51% attacker was able to do, and then the decision  (Which I feel is a terrible one) to in essence create new coins to  payback Binance.\n\nEssentially,  in Proof of Work, peers follow the chain with more work aka the longest  chain. Reorganization is part of the protocol and happens often, thus  why exchanges, third-party services, and even the core wallet has a  minimum amount of confirmations before they let you transfer the coins  that you received/sent. This is standard and is baseline protection for  the entire network.\n\nNow...  what happens if I have the hashing power majority in the network? Let\u2019s  say suddenly, I rent (for NOT that much money) mining power to direct  to a network for 24\u201348 hours.\n\nWith enough power/control, I could force a reorganization at any time. This  means that I can send a transaction to the exchange, wait for the  confirmations, exchange the coins for btc/monero/whatever, and then  \\*poof\\* reorganize the chain to another one\u2026 one in which in THAT chain  returns the coins that I had just spent to the exchange back to me. How  is this possible? Well, because in that alternate chain that I just  pushed the network onto, those coins were never spent in the new chain  that I created. So now, my wallet experiences never having any of my  Zcoin / FIRO moving, but, I now have all this new BTC as well (as a  result of the prior chain sending Zcoin / FIRO to the exchange, quickly  trading for BTC, and whala, \u201cfree money\u201d). Another way to think of it is  this: It\u2019s like temporarily pushing this reality into an alternate  reality\u2026long enough to do something, before people catch on and then  push back to the \u201coriginal\u201d reality.\n\nNow, imagine doing this over, and over, and over as long as I have the dominant power/hashing power.\n\nIn  the case of the Zcoin / FIRO attacker, the attacker pwnd the chain for  an entire day, so they won every single block in those 25hs (5 min per  block, 12.5 FIRO per block I think). Thus, the amount of coins that they  were able to spend and re-spend was VERY large (5\u201310% of the total coin  supply).\n\nSo\u2026what  happened? Binance basically took in a ton of FIRO, swapped for BTC, and  then poof\u2026those FIRO are no longer there in THEIR wallets (because the  chain was just re-organized BACK).\n\nSo,  this is pretty bad right? This has been one of the tenets of the issues  with Proof of Work (coins like Zcoin / FIRO), because anyone with  enough power (money or resources) can in essence OWN the network, go  spend coins onto markets to get BTC, and then \u201cbloop\u201d those coins  magically were never spent, leaving the attacker with a fat stack of the  coin + BTC/some other coin as well.\n\nAnd  it doesn\u2019t cost as much as you might think. For some of these PoW  networks, it might cost a few hundred dollars (or even a few thousand  dollars). Pull it off (which this attacker did to Zcoin / FIRO), and you  could end up with a LOT more (in this attack, they abused Zcoin / FIRO  to the tune of at least 4million+ **USD (conservative approximation: 900,000 FIRO x $4.47 per FIRO)).**\n\n\u2014\u200a\u2014\n\nSo what is Zcoin/FIRO doing that\u2019s so bad? Well, if the above isn\u2019t enough to ruin your day\u2026  **Zcoin / FIRO seems to be unilaterally making a decision to go against  their decentralized \u201cpremise\u201d, paying off exchanges, and setting a  terrible standard.**\n\nInstead  of just calling it what it is (again, we don\u2019t know the conversations  between Zcoin / FIRO and Binance), where the attacker scalped a boatload  from this attack\u2026\n\nZcoin / FIRO is seemingly choosing to do the following:\n\nRollback the chain (which itself is a highly controversial decision)\n\nIssue \u201cthemselves\u201d (to Zcoin / FIRO) a NEW amount of coins (That mirror the amount of coins that was double-spent to Binance)\n\nUse these newly minted coins to payback Binance.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but this is just insane.\n\nYou are a decentralized project now \u201cunilaterally\u201d creating new coins\n\nYou are then using these coins to pay a literal money machine (exchange)\n\nYou  are setting a precedent that in the future, any loss on an exchange,  that it\u2019s upon the project to pony up to cover those losses.\n\nLook.  Reuben is careful in choosing his words. He is making it seem like  Zcoin / FIRO are rolling back the chain and are taking the coins from  the attacker. However, this is impossible as those coins don\u2019t exist  anymore (chain rollback).\n\nSo if indeed they are paying off Binance, where are those coins coming from?\n\n**This is also not the first time Zcoin / FIRO has been successfully attacked.**\n\nBack  in 2017, 370,000 fake Zcoin were created which perpetrators sold for  over 400 Bitcoins ($440,000 at the time). Curiously, back then, they  were proud to say they were choosing to not be like Ethereum during the  DAO event where ETH rolled back the chain to \u201cremove\u201d the attackers\u2019 coins.",

            "text": "I've seen a lot of talk on Crypto Twitter this week about the rise of BSC and BNB into a top 3 coin, but in particular the questions it raises about crypto and decentralised finance. Typically ETH maxis have been yelling \"this isn't what we've been building for!\" and subsequently the Binance crowd yelling back \"fix ETH and your fees or we can't use the network!\"\n\nI wanted to share a few thoughts on this I've been having, why I have mixed feelings about it, where I think we will head next, and my personal favourite alternative to both Ethereum & the Binance Smart Chain (I would love people to let me know their thoughts and personal favourite alternatives in the comments!)\n\nGas fees have evolved from the nuisance they once were, into an debilitating barrier to use for most. \n\nInstant firctionless transactions made possible with cryptography is what BSC offers, and for many that's an incredible proposition. They remove the fees, increase the choice, and make it even easier to trade than the current alternatives, all whilst integrating with most of the market alternatives. They're gaining power and for good reason. \n\nIn the short term, I believe this is actually a great thing for crypto. It allows the peaking interest which has increased throughout 2020-2021 (thus far) to be sustainable. ETH fees had pushed most people back into CEXs and made many trading pairs inaccessible. BSC doesn't solve the problem, but it certainly allows market participation, which crypto needs for it to survive. \n\nLonger term? No. We already have finance built on centralised islands of power, and crypto is ultimately all about decentralising finance. \n\nWe need a protocol which can support everything we want from the market, including low fees, firctionless liquidity, fast transaction finality, and crucially, ease of use. \n\nThere are quite a few layer 1 protocols aiming to do this, I.e. Maintain the positive qualities ETH has whilst eliminating all of its shortcomings. Everyone has their view on which \"contender\" might rise to the challenge, but so far none have really come close. This isn't about beating ETH, it's about providing the market with a protocol which is a viable option for building an entire decentralised ecosystem on. If we cannot achieve this goal and remain decentralised then my personal view is we fall very, very short of Satoshi's vision, and the true potential distributed ledger technology offers. \n\nI said I had a personal favourite protocol, and it  is Radix DLT. They're the only \"alternative\" to ETH which maintains something called atomic composability. This is an attribute ETH 1.0 has which ETH 2.0 loses due to sharding. I'll avoid the technical explanation here, but essentially without it you can't run transactions across multiple Dapps seamlessly in a single block. Losing atomic composability means breaking Defi and no protocol other than Radix maintains it in a sharded architecture. They have spent 7+ years developing their protocol to ensure scalability is achieved without a single compromise. That's why I bet on them to lead the way for Defi. \n\nPartnerships and accessibility are also going to be key, and Radix is partnered up with AAVE and LINK in the GoodFi alliance, along with Messari and a few others, with the goal of on boarding 100m people to DeFi by 2025. Tie that in with a scalable protocol which remains decentralised, and I think it could really contend in the long term. \n\nThat said, it takes time to build ecosystems, and whilst ETH struggles in the short term, it shouldn't be seen as a complete negative if chains like BSC fill a current void, as long as a centralised ecosystem is not our final destination (I am confident it won't be!)\n\nI'd love to hear some thoughts on the ETH vs BSC situation we find ourselves in, and any personal favourite L1s people have. Please do add reasoning for supporting a L1, I don't won't mindless shilling, but passionate technical debate would be most welcome!",

Gamers no longer have to be professionals to earn money playing video games. Earnings are distributed fairly and the platform provides gamers honest rewards and control over their earnings.\n\nAs a gamer, how do you earn on Exeedme when you play?\n\n1. Earn by Winning:\nChallenge friends or let matchmaking work. Set the stakes and fund them with liquid cryptos. Winner takes it all.\n\n2. Earn by Playing:\nWhether a gamer wins or loses, every time there is a bet on your skills, you are game mining a XED reward.\n\n3. Earn by Progressing:\nBy staking XED, players unlock NFT rewards which grow in exclusivity and rarity as they grow their ranking position.\n\nTop competitors of Exeedme includes the likes of: Enjin, Game credits, Chain Games etc.\n\nWhat makes Exeedme different and unique is the fact it's platform focuses on the integration of existing games with a large following. In the beta version, Exeedme is integrated with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and in the future it should integrate League of Legends, FIFA and many others.\nFor gamers, the only difference is how you launch the game. Instead of launching them from the main platform, the games will be launched through Exeedme (they\u2019ll play against other gamers inside Exeedme).\n\nAside gaming, Exeedme has also progressed greatly in aspect of DeFi, it recently launched it's staking pool on both the Ethereum and Binance smart chain network which got filled exactly 10 days after with a total of 2,500,000 XED staked.\nXED also has a farming pool on Beefy Finance with an APY going over 600% where you can farm to earn.\n\nXED in my opinion, has to be one of the most underrated small cap cryptos because when you consider the fundamentals of the project and how much work is being put in, it deserves to reflect on the token performance. \nI got into XED for the sole aim of holding long term and that's what I'll be doing because I know it would be well worth it with time.",

But when you watch your money goes ~~down the drain~~ under the label \u201clong-term investment,\u201d it\u2019s time to rethink your strategy.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019ve invested quite a few bucks in crypto, and I truly believe that in a year or two, I\u2019ll be thinking where else to shove an extra couple of thousands. But let\u2019s talk about here and now. Sitting on my backside won\u2019t refuel my car and my whiskey tumbler. And since I\u2019m a regular in trading and crypto communities, I\u2019ve started looking around in search of the low-risk alternatives.\n\nWell, when there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way.\n\n## Cryptocurrencies, ICOs, Security Tokens\n\nI don\u2019t want to touch a sore subject, but still, let\u2019s recollect how the things were developing on the cryptocurrency market. First, we all rushed to buy Bitcoin. We entered a market more or less decently and followed the trend upwards. At some point, it became not enough. And we started forming our investment portfolio, Bitcoin-centered but expanding to other coins like Ethereum, Ripple, Monero, and so on. Our capital was growing, nice and smooth.\n\nNext, there was the stage of ICO investments. Almost every single project, even quite scammy ones, was giving crazy x\u2019s. Of course, we\u2019ve got tempted (well, I did). And our nice portfolio started lacking Bitcoins and refilling with some trashy tokens like DTH, XBR, HYB and similar.\n\nLet\u2019s not continue; we all know what happened next.\n\nI hope you haven\u2019t cashed out the remnants of your portfolio and just calmly put them off for better times. Forget about your coins for a year or two, consider them frozen.\n\nNow, we are moving to the short term. I suggest looking at the new megatrend within the crypto field - **security tokens**. The name didn\u2019t even exist a few years ago, and even now it remains quite a novelty (it\u2019d be too late to talk about it if everyone knew, wouldn\u2019t it?). **This thing can bring you a stable monthly income - checked by myself.** Here\u2019re the details.\n\n## Some Theory Behind Security Tokens\n\nThey originate from securities - tradable financial assets like stocks, options, etc. If we view security tokens as stocks, then it becomes clear that it\u2019s a way to own a part of a business. The scheme is simple: a company wants to raise some money from investors, and it offers some return mechanism - dividends, interest rates, profit shares. Now, shift this principle to the crypto field, and you\u2019ll get a security token. It all can be distilled down to one statement: **security tokens generate profits for the token holders**.\n\nIn the USA, to be considered a *security,* the token has to meet the following requirements (due to the [Howey Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_v._W._J._Howey_Co.)):\n\n* there\u2019s a money investment\n* in a common enterprise\n* you expect profits\n* the efforts are not yours\n\nThese are SEC-regulated projects. Still, there are quite a few outside-SEC-jurisdiction blockchain startups that can bring profits.\n\nThink about it. You don\u2019t invest in something that may or may not play out, as with ICOs. You give your money to some blockchain project and receive returns every month. For businesses, it means more investors\u2019 attention, more liquidity to the securities market, and more tradable tokens. If they fail to pay what\u2019s been promised, they lose their investors in a minute.\n\nSo, now you can guess how I\u2019ve started to come back on track. I looked for the projects that pay crypto dividends to their token holders. Then, I tried to come up with the estimated daily and monthly earnings. After that, I chose the most profitable projects and invested small sums to check them out. Some of the projects fell off with time; others are still performing well with more significant sums.\n\nBut after I\u2019ve done all the work on finding and choosing the best-paying dapps, it dawned on me that I can help others to do the same thing. And I\u2019ve come up with the CryptoDividend idea.\n\n## Crypto Dividends\n\nFree. Useful. Constantly updated. For cryptocurrency investments.\n\nThis is all you have to know about my service.\n\nWell, okay, not all. My website is mainly a list of companies that offer a part of their business profits to token holders. I\u2019m calculating and displaying the estimated earnings from the cryptocurrency dividends. How? I make my own investments or review the payout history on different resources. Then, I calculate daily dividend ROI based on the token exchange price, number of staked tokens and payout history. [Check it out](https://cryptodividend.io/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=article1).\n\nThere\u2019s just one issue - for now, practically all listed projects are about gambling. No, you don\u2019t need to play to get dividends, you can just hold their tokens and cash out your money. At a very rough estimate, **your $1000 investment will make you 300 bucks a month**. So much for the prejudice against gambling. And, well, let\u2019s be honest, investment *is* gambling. Our entire life is gambling, for Bitcoin\u2019s sake! If yours is not, how did you even get so far?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m working to improve my service with some new and shiny features and add more dapps and projects from other industries. Feel free to visit [cryptodividend.io](https://cryptodividend.io/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=article1) (pun intended) and choose the project to invest.",

            "text": "**What is [Sentinel](www.sentinel.co) ?**\n\nSentinel Network is a network layer that enables true p2p and decentralized applications and resources marketplace. You can think of it as the Uber for Bandwith. Users can use the protocol to buy/sell excess bandwith with the primary use case for this being a decentralized VPN.\n\n**What makes Sentinel different than a traditional VPN?**\n\nTraditional VPN services are centralized and usually proprietary and closed-source. Country-specific laws can often require businesses to share information on their users and their web activity with regulators. This makes it likely that some centralized services keep logs of traffic in order to be compliant \u2013 which means your data is traceable and hence not private. Additionally, traditional VPN companies (because of fiat payment) will know a user\u2019s name, email, address and potentially credit card information which compromises your security as even the largest VPN provider was hacked last year. ([https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/21/nordvpn-confirms-it-was-hacked/](https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/21/nordvpn-confirms-it-was-hacked/))\n\nDecentralized VPNs, such as Sentinel, which are blockchain-based are a solution to these problems. Sentinel has no singular point of control and depends on individuals operating nodes to run the system. Since there is no centralized server relaying information \u2013 there is no possibility of data-logging. This can all be verified as Sentinel\u2019s code is open-sourced. Sentinel\u2019s mainnet will run on Cosmos which through IBC will allow you to pay in multiple crypto currencies or fiat.\n\n**Does Sentinel have a working product?**\n\nYes. These is currently a desktop application for Windows, Linux and Mac. As well as an app for Android. iOS should be released in the coming weeks. (It has been in beta testing for months and you can get access to the beta test by asking in the Telegram group.) There are over 350 nodes being hosted on the network and there has been exponential growth of usage with data consumed on the network averaging over 3TB a day. (see [stats.sentinel.co](http://stats.sentinel.co/) for more information and charts). There have been over 100k downloads of the Sentinel app on Android as well as over 50k of a white-labeled application, Velocity VPN.\n\nCurrently, Sentinel is running on the Ethereum Testnet but by the end of the year a new Version 3 dVPN application will be released on Cosmos which will feature a customized Cosmos/Tendermint based wallet and Wireguard based nodes.\n\n**Who is the team behind Sentinel?**\n\nThe team is currently anonymous for liability reasons as they finalize forming the SNT foundation. Once the foundation is formed their identities will be revealed. With that being said, normally an anonymous team would concern me but the Sentinel team is highly regarded and well respected within the Cosmos ecosystem. Their experience is evidenced by their strong showing in the Cosmos game of Zones, winning the Phase 1A and Phase 2 challenges (source: [https://cosmos.network/goz](https://cosmos.network/goz)). In addition to this, Dokia capital recently redelegated their atoms to smaller validators that have consistently contributed to the ecosystem, specifically highlighting Sentinel as one of this validators in this post. ([https://medium.com/dokia/theatomicspreadout-sentinel-835b587950e7](https://medium.com/dokia/theatomicspreadout-sentinel-835b587950e7))\n\nThere are currently 3 developers working on the back end, 3 working on the front-end/design side and then others supporting both android and iOS.\n\nExidio is a for-profit organization that will be focusing on development and implementation of the Sentinel dVPN. Exidio has the mission of \u2018Providing Secure Access to the Web 3.0\u2019 by contributing to and implementing on the Sentinel dVPN and Sentinel\u2019s Cosmos based blockchain infrastructure. Exidio will be working with entrepreneurs as well as existing companies in the VPN space to either construct a new dVPN application, or transition an existing VPN network onto a dVPN network. www.exidio.co\n\n**What is the SENT Token used for?**\n\nUpon the mainnet launch the SENT token will have a number of uses:\n\n\u00b7 Method of payment for bandwith/dVPN services\n\n\u00b7 Governance token for upgrade and community proposals\n\n\u00b7 Staking to secure the network with an annual yield somewhere between 10-50%\n\n\u00b7 SENT staked will also earn a % (20?) of the profit from the dvpn nodes\n\nMore details on the utility of the SENT token will be in the whitepaper which is due to be released before year end.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nThe current marketcap of Sentinel is 7M USD. This is the fully diluted marketcap as all 2B coins are in circulation so there is no risk of coins being released into circulation which reduces selling pressure. Sentinel\u2019s biggest competition is Orchid Protocol (OXT) which has a fully diluted marketcap of $320M USD. There are many differences between SENT and OXT in how they approach dVPN and no reason why both cannot be successful but when comparing marketcaps and the tech, SENT seems undervalued on a relative comparison basis.\n\nFrom a macro/traditional markets standpoint:  the Global VPN market in 2020 is estimated to generate $30B in Revenues annually and continue growing at a rate of 17.4%. With the impact of COVID-19 and the surge in people working from home this rate of growth could be much faster as habits are changing and individuals/corporations are adapting.\n\nIf we take a very conservative estimate and assume that Sentinel captures .01% of the global VPN total addressable market (TAM) this would result in annual sales/revenues of $3M. We can use this assumption to calculate the Price to Sales (P/S) ratio:\n\nTAM: 30B (see above)\n\nMarket share: .01% (estimate)\n\nRevenue: 3M\n\nTotal tokens outstanding: 2B\n\nRevenue/coin: .0015 (3M / 2B)\n\nToken price: .0034\n\nP/S : 2.2667\n\nWe can compare this P/S ratio to listed equities in the Cybersecurity sector (if anyone has any comps they think would be better please put them in comments and I can add):\n\nPalo Alto Networks(PANW) P/S: 7.9\n\nFortinet (FTNT) P/S: 8.3\n\nCheckpoint Software(CHKP): 8.2\n\nUsing these comps, Sentinel is undervalued 3-4x to its peers. As a startup, Sentinel should command a high P/S to factor in the growth premium than its more mature peers listed above to factor in its higher than industry average growth rate and increased market penetration. There are undoubtedly risks though to investing in such a young company in a nascent technology. The question we as investors have to answer is does the reward justify the risk.\n\n**Upcoming catalysts**\n\nThese are the upcoming catalysts before the end of the year that could lead to increased adoption of the SENT token and result in price appreciation:\n\n\u00b7 New V3 dVPN Application with Tendermint Wallet\n\n\u00b7 Announcements of Supporting Exchanges on Mainnet Swap\n\n\u00b7 Updated Whitepaper Release\n\n\u00b7 New Sentinel iOS dVPN Launch on App Store\n\n\u00b7 Updated Website Release\n\n\u00b7 Roadmap Release\n\nPlease do your own research before investing.

It is built by a third party company on top of the sentinel dvpn network. So this whitelabel sentinel vpn can charge fiat payments from its users, but it has to pay the node runners in cryptocurrency. A certain percentage of these crypto payments will then get redistributed among all holders of sentinel. This idea of whitelabel vpns will enable much more usability for the end users, as they do not have to worry about cryptocurrencies at all. This will enable explosive growth of the sentinel ecosystem!",

While battle proving its fully decentralized PoS, multiple smartcontract languages have been deployed and several tooling services have added Tezos besides ETH (Truffle Suite, Magik SDK and Ganache-CLI). The stage is set.\n\nWhy would you move over to Tezos? Because it's fast, reliable, and cheap. [On average 3,000 times cheaper than Ethereum and 40 times cheaper than Cardano.](https://www.publish0x.com/publish0x-posts/the-last-upgrade-on-tezos-decreased-transaction-fees-3215-tr-xvrvwkr) \n\nDeFi components on Tezos: [We have Dexterexchange  live for a while and its use shows healthy growth.](https://twitter.com/DexterExchange/status/1339648930812989441)\n\nStablecoins.

[Renault involved here and BMW looking closely.](https://xtz.news/latest-tezos-news/werenode-draft-whitepaper-collaboration-with-members-of-nomadic-labs-and-renault-on-delegation-based-financing/)\nTezos' LPoS offers something unique here, so this use-case will only be possible on Tezos currently. Factors:\n\n- Delegating\n- No automated payouts. (This is why this wouldn't work onCardano)\n- No fixed period for delegating\n\nThat set of qualities is unique and makes CDO's possible.",

            "text": "*Stablecoins are a major use case for DeFi but come in various different forms. The stablecoin space is still relatively young and underserved \u2013 but that\u2019s changing fast.*\n\nStablecoins are one of the most important and popular DeFi products, enabling users to hedge and store value on the blockchain, without having to use exchanges or other centralised providers.\n\nAs a smart contracts and DeFi platform, Ergo is well suited for building all kinds of dApps, including stablecoins. You\u2019ll certainly be hearing more from us in the future about a stablecoin on the Ergo blockchain, but until then, we want to introduce and unpack the idea as context for what\u2019s coming.\n\nDifferent stablecoin approaches\n\nThere are various ways to peg a crypto token to the dollar or another fiat currency. The easiest way is to hold dollars in a bank account, and issue one token for every dollar you have. This is exactly the approach that Tether (USDT) takes. This offers users the ability to store and transfer USD easily, without using an exchange. However, this approach is still highly centralised; you have to trust Tether that they have enough dollars in their bank account to cover the issued tokens. Tether is well known for being opaque and refusing proper audits. The token could also be shut down if a regulator managed to freeze their accounts.\n\nThere are various backed stablecoins on the market, which take broadly the same approach. Tokens like USDC and Gemini dollars are much the same, but they are far more transparent, and operate within a clear regulatory framework. Then there are projects like TrustToken, which underpins the TrueUSD token (TUSD); this is much the same again, though takes a more distributed approach, with both a high degree of transparency and multiple banking partners.\n\nAll of these necessarily have a degree of centralisation and risk, because they rely on banking partners \u2013 and those accounts can potentially be frozen, shut down or even raided.\n\nOther projects \u2013 notably the Maker Protocol \u2013 attempt to address this with a fully decentralised model. Maker\u2019s Dai is an algorithmic stablecoin: a \u2018synthetic\u2019 dollar that is not backed by real dollars as USDT, USDC and other stablecoins are.\n\nDai are issued from \u2018Vaults\u2019 backed by crypto collateral (mostly ETH). A system of smart contracts and oracles (decentralised price feeds) ensures that every Dai issued is collateralised by at least $1.50; if the ratio falls too low, the Vault is closed and the Dai repurchased automatically. It\u2019s a complex and impressive system, and the largest project in the DeFi space.\n\nSome stablecoins are more stable than others\n\nStablecoins have been around since at least 2014, though the first attempts had limited success. The earliest algorithmic coins, like NuBits and BitUSD, did not have the benefit of smart contracts platforms (which were only available with the launch of Ethereum in 2015). They tended to be centralised or semi-centralised, and didn\u2019t work well in practice. (NuBits, for example, lost its peg and has completely collapsed.)\n\nTether, which has been around since 2014, has grown into a multi-billion-dollar phenomenon, with tens of billions of dollars of daily volumes. However, while Tether generally keeps its peg pretty well, occasional quirks of the market and fears about the company\u2019s reserves mean it has not always been worth $1 (once dropping as low as $0.90). USDC, which is more trustworthy and transparent, tends to have lower spreads and a more reliable peg.\n\nMeanwhile Dai, as the foremost algorithmic stablecoin, has historically done well. It aims to maintain a \u2018soft\u2019 peg, with decentralised monetary policy nudging it back towards $1 if market conditions push it too far away from this. This has generally been successful; the only time prices have deviated significantly was on the enormous market volatility of \u2018Black Thursday\u2019 in March, which saw a massive sell-off of almost every fiat and crypto asset.\n\nAlgo, collateralised, back or a combination?\n\nAnd so the existing stablecoins take one or more of several approaches to keeping the token pegged to the dollar. The simplest, but also the most centralised, is to back the token with actual dollars. You can also back it with crypto, so long as you ensure there is enough collateral to cover the tokens issued in the event of market volatility. Algorithmic stablecoins use price feeds and decentralised monetary policy to make it more or less attractive to buy or sell the tokens, helping to ensure the price gravitates towards $1.\n\nEvery approach has its strengths and weaknesses. Ergo will be announcing details of its own implementations in the coming weeks, and explaining why its developers are taking the approach they are.",

            "text": "Zenon is implementing a fully decentralized dual-coin mechanism. The coinmetrics are designed to achieve a Mint-Burn equilibrium for ZNN and QSR as the first dual-coin architecture of its kind.\n\nWhat is it:\n\nIncredibly fast, almost infinitely scalable state-of-the-art DLT. It combines the block-lattice architecture that was first(?) used by Raiblocks/Nano with a DAG that exists as a separate layer for the consensus. The block-lattice handles the transactions. It's going to be used to scale Web3 dapps as a L1, and also process transactions as a L2 chain.\n\nWho does it:\n\nThis is an independent, open-source project and will probably be run by a foundation similar to Ethereum and Cardano, but I'm about 99.5% sure its backed by Square. I can enumerate the zillions of times they have hinted as such if I really have to here, but you can search for old biz posts on Zenon here and also on Warosu.\n\nSquare will likely use it to scale Bitcoin transactions where the default payment for merchants and Cashapp users is made in BTC, and then they can set it to dollars or pounds or whatever afterwards.\n\nIts open source and not owned by Square, like how Node.js isn't owned by Google but has wide adoption. They'll easily recruit 1000s of legacy web apps for this bc no code changes are needed, and also dapps on Ethereum will easily switch over.\n\nThey are still in testnet, and not very public yet. Large exchanges expect payment, and/or the coin to already be established within the cryptosphere.  Also you can earn passive income on your [$ZNN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ZNN&src=cashtag_click) Avg 55% APY. No need to send it anywhere stake it yourself on your own pc. \n\nIf this sparked your interest, make sure to read this guide that a longtime community member made: [https://shazzamazzash.medium.com/zenon-network-an-apes-guide-to-the-galaxy-7aad7dacdfef](https://shazzamazzash.medium.com/zenon-network-an-apes-guide-to-the-galaxy-7aad7dacdfef)",

            "text": "Summation of RaiBlocks lead developer AMA. I'm very excited about this coin, and if you're asking why I did this...I'm trying out my AMA consolidating script that I wrote for fun :) I'm interested in seeing what people think about this coin! You can read the responses directly from this link: https://www.reddit.com/r/RaiBlocks/comments/7ko5l7/colin_lemahieu_founder_and_lead_developer_of/\n\n_______________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**What are your top priorities atm? Both in developing areas itself and in terms of integration?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe top priorities right now are:\n\n- Wallets desktop/mobile and ease-of-use improvements to the node\n\n- Integration with exchanges\n\n- Vendor adoption wider user adoption\n\nThese basically need to happen in a sequence because each item isn't useful unless the previous one is complete.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_______________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Do you have any plans to have your source code peer reviewed? By peer review I mean sending your source code down to MIT for testing and review.**\n\n**Where do you see Raiblocks 5-10 years from now? (For instance do you envision people using a Raiblocks mobile phone app to transfer value between each other, or buy stuff at the store?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe definitely need peer and code reviews and we're open to anyone doing this. We have ideas for people in universities that want to analyze the whitepaper or code so we'll see what comes of that. In my opinion code security guarantees can only be given with (eyes * time) and we need both.\n\nI'd like to see RaiBlocks adopted as an internet RFC and basically become an ubiquitous background technology like http. I think you're probably right and a mobile app would be the most user-friendly way to do this so people don't need to carry around extra cards in their wallet etc.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_______________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Is there a list of the team readily available? Are there firm plans to expand, and if so, in which directions?**\n\n**The roadmap indicated a website redesign scheduled for November 2017. Is there an update?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe have about 12 people in the core team; about half are code and half are business developers. On the redesigned website we're going to include bios for sure, no one in our team is anonymous. I think we have pretty good coverage of what we need right now, we could always use more people capable of contributing to the core code.\n\nThe website design is well underway, we wanted to streamline and add some more things to it so it took longer than originally estimated. It'll looking like after the new year we'll have it ready.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_______________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Would you ever consider renaming the coin to simply \"Rai\" or any other simplified form other than RaiBlocks?**\n\n**2. What marketing strategy do you think will push XRB forward from now on as a fully working product. Instant and free, the green coin, \"it just works\" coin, etc?**\n\n**3. Regarding security, is \"quantum-proofing\" a big concern at the moment and how do you guys plan to approach this when the time comes. And how possible would it be for bad actors to successfully implement a 51% attack.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. Yea there are a few difficulties people have pointed out with our name. People don't know if it's \"ray\" or \"rye\". \"Blocks\" doesn't have a meaning to a lot of people and the name reference might be too esoteric to be meaningful. I'm not prideful so I'm not stuck on a particular name, we'll take a look at what our marketing and business developers say peoples' impressions are and if they have any naming recommendations.\n\n2. Our marketing strategy is to focus on complete simplicity. Instant and free resonates with enthusiasts and mass adoption will only come when using xrb is absolutely the same experience as using a banking or other payment app. People aren't going to tolerate jargon or confusing workflows when sending or receiving payments.\n\n3. Quantum computing is going to be an amazing leap for humanity but it's also going to cause a lot of flux in cryptography. The plan I see is the similar to what I did in selecting the cryptographic algorithms we're using right now: look for leaders in academia and industry that have proven implementations and use those as they recommend migration based on computing capability. Quantum vulnerabilities can be an issue in the future but a vulnerable implementation would be an issue right now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_______________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Hi Colin, lately XRB has been getting frequently compared to and contrasted with Iota. I was hoping that you could give us your thoughts on the differences between the two and what your general vision for the future of Raiblocks is.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt's flattering to be compared to IOTA, they have a very talented team building ambitious technology. When looking at design goals I think one thing we're not attempting to approach is transferring a data payload, we're only looking to be a transfer of value.\n\nThere are lots of ideas and technology to be developed in the cryptocurrency space and I want RaiBlocks to solve one section of that industry: the transfer of value. I think the best success would be if RaiBlocks was adopted as the global standard for this and crypto efforts could move to non-value-transfer use-cases.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_______________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Do you see XRB becoming the new payment method for commerce. As in, buying coffee, groceries, etc? Do you have plans for combating the HODL mentality so this currency can actually be used in the future of buying and selling?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBeing a direct transactional payment method is our goal and we're trying to build software that's accessible to everyone to make that happen. I see holding as a speculative tactic anticipating future increases and you're right, it's not in line with day-to-day transactions. I think as market cap levels off to a more consistent value the reason for holding and speculating goes away and people can instead focus on using it as a value exchange.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_______________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Are you planning to expand the RaiBlocks team over the next 12 months? If so, what types of positions are you hoping to fill?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRight now we have about 12 people, half core and half business developers. I think this count is good for working on what we're doing right now which is getting wallets and exchanges worked on. Ideally people outside our team will start developing technology around xrb taking advantage of the network effect to build more technology faster than we could internally. That being said we're going to look in a few months to see if there's anything out there people aren't developing that should be and we'll see what people we need to make it happen. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**At what point did you make the decision to make RaiBlocks your full time job? What was the decision making process like?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt was after the week where the core team met here in Austin to brainstorm our next steps. I saw how much enthusiasm there was from crypto-veterans with having a working system capable of being scaled up to what's needed for massive adoption and it seemed the risk needed to be taken.\n\nIt was hard decision to make, working in the crypto and finance is rough and I like using my leisure time to work on inventions. Of all the projects ideas I have this one seemed to have a high chance of success and the benefits of having a working, decentralized currency would be huge.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Hi Colin, what prevents great cryptos like XRB from being listed on bigger exchanges?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt's good to understand where the biggest headaches for exchanges lie: support tickets, operations, and development. If a technology is different from what they already have, that takes development time. If the software is new and not widely run, that's potential operations time to fix it which results in support tickets and community backlash. Adding BitCoin clones or Ethereum ICO coins is easy because they don't have these associated risks or costs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**What can the average RaiBlocks-Fan do to help XRB getting adopted / growing / expanding?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think the best thing an average fan could do is word of mouth and telling people about RaiBlocks. More people being aware of it means there's the possibility someone who's never heard of it before would be interested in contributing as a vendor, developer, exchange etc.\n\nGood advertising or marketing will never be able to reach everyone as well as someone reaching out within their own network.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Ray or Rye?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRay hehe. It comes from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stones Lots of people don't know the answer though >_<\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Are you looking at incorperating a datamarket like iota in the future? Given the speed of the network a data exchange for highly accurate sensors could be a game changer.**\n\n**Further more, are there any plans to increase the Dev team in the future? I read on the FAQ you'd like RaiBlocks to be somewhat of a protocol which is a huge ambition. A Dev from say the Mozilla foundation or other could further cement this ambitious project.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTransmitting data payloads is something we probably won't pursue. The concern is adding more features like this could cause us to make decisions that compromise the primary focus points of low-cost and speed for transferring value.\n\nWe can add people to the dev team though I think we'll get the most traction by teaching teams in these other organization how to use RaiBlocks so they can be the experts on the subject in their companies.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Does the actual RaiBlocks version require \"Each node in the network must be aware of all transactions as they occur\" part? This was in the old white paper and is asked here:**\n\n**https://www.reddit.com/r/RaiBlocks/comments/7ksl81/some_questions_regarding_raiblocks_consensus/?st=jbdmgagc&sh=d1c93cca**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf a node wants to independently know the balances of all accounts in the system, it must at a minimum have storage to hold accounts and all their balances. In order to know all balances it must either listen to transactions as they're happening or bootstrap from someone else to catch up as what happens on startup.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**There is no incentive to run nodes. Some people will do it because it is cheap as fuck (as I read an raspberry pie can run it). But I think not many people will do it.**\n\n**1. How important are the nodes in terms of further scaling?**\n\n**2. On which network conditions where the 7000 transactions met?**\n\n**3. What happens if the transactions per day tenfolds but the nodes don't?**\n\n**4. How much better will Rai scale if someone sets up, lets say, 100 nodes with awesome hardware and network?**\n\n**5. How many nodes could be enough for visa level scaling?**\n\n**6. Which further improvements can be made for Rai IF there needs to be other improvements than setting up new nodes? Are there other concepts like 2nd layer solutions planned?**\n\n**7. How will Rai defend network attacks?**\n\n**I know there is an PoW part. But since there a also large attacks on high cap coins on which people invest millions of $ to congest a network..Is it possible that the Rai network will be unusable for several days because of this?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think the out-of-protocol incentives to running a node are under-referenced yet I see them as the primary driving factor for participating as a whole. Node rewards come at the expense of other network participants and in this closed loop the incentives aren't enough to keep a cryptocurrency alive. Long-term there needs to be a system-level comparative advantage to what people are already using for a transfer of value. If someone is using xrb and it saves them hundreds or thousands of dollars per month in fees and customer irritation in delayed payments, they have a direct monetary incentive to using xrb and a monetary incentive in the health of the system.\n\n1) More nodes provides transaction and bootstrapping redundancy. More representatives provides decentralization.\n\n2) The 7k TPS was a profile how fast commodity hardware could eat transactions. All of the real-world limits are going to be something hardware related, either bandwidth, IO, or CPU.\n\n3) The scaling is more related to the hardware the nodes are using rather than the node count. If there was 10x increase in transactions it would use 10x the bandwidth and IO as nodes observe transactions happening.\n\n4) If someone made 100 representative nodes the network would be far more decentralized though the tx throughput would be unchanged since that's a per-node requirement.\n\n5) Scaling to Visa will have high bandwidth and IO requirements on representatives associated with doing 10k IOPS. Datacenter and business class hardware will have to be enough to handle the load.\n\n6) Second layer solutions are always an option and I think a lot of people will use them for fraud protection and insurance. Our primary focus is to make the 1st layer as efficient and high speed as possible so a 2nd layer isn't needed for daily transactions.\n\n7) Defending against network attacks will be an ongoing thing, people like breaking the network for lulz or monetary gain i.e. competing cryptos. If there are attacks we haven't defended against or considered it'll be a matter of getting capable people to fix issues.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Are you open to changes to the name? (Rai)**\n    \n**What are your plans with regards to marketing?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm open to it, people get confused on ray/rye pronunciation, not the greatest first impression.\n\nAs far as timing I think marketing works best after a more user friendly wallet and integration in to more exchanges otherwise we're sending traffic to something people can't use. We're going to start by focusing on the initial adopters which will likely be enthusiasts and going forward work on the next set of users that aren't enthusiasts but want to drive savings for their business through lower payment processing costs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A recent tweet(https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/942961006614945792) from Vitalik Buterin. Could this be a case with testing the scalability of RaiBlocks as well and in reality we wouldn't come close to 7000tx/s?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think he's definitely right, a lot of the TPS numbers are synthetic benchmarks usually on one system. The biggest thing hindering TPS are protocol-specific limits like hard caps or high contention design. The next biggest thing will be bandwidth and then disk IO. Some of these limits can be improved by profiling and fixing code instead of actual limits in the hardware.\n\nWe want to get better, real world numbers but our general opinion is that the RaiBlocks protocol is going to be limited by hardware, rather than design.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Are you planning to add a fiat gateway to the main website and mobile wallet?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf we can make it happen for sure, that seems like a very user-focused feature people would want.\n\nThe difficulty at least in the US is the money-transmitter licenses which are hard to obtain. More than likely if this functionality was added it'd be a partnership with an established financial company that has procedures in place to operate within countries' regulations.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**I saw a post on /r/iota that claims that their quantum resistance is a main benefit over raiblocks. Can you go into detail about this? explain any plans you have to let XRB persevere through upcoming quatum revolution?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think everyone with cryptography in their programs is keeping an eye on quantum cryptography because we're all in the same boat. I don't have cryptanalysis credentials so I didn't feel comfortable building an implementation and instead chose to use one off-the-shelf from someone with assuring credentials.\n\nThere are some big companies that have made small mistakes that blow up the usefulness of the entire algorithm, it's incredibly easy to do. https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/12/ps3-hacked-through-poor-implementation-of-cryptography/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Hello Colin, is any security audit to the source code planned?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe don't have one contracted though both internally and externally this is an important thing people want completed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Do you have plans to radically change the interface of the desktop wallet, and to develop a universal, cross-platform, clean and simple UX design for the wallet? This will be huge for mass adoption in my humble opinion**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI completely agree, we do plan on completely redoing the desktop wallet, both from a UX standpoint and maintainability so UI code doesn't need to be in C++. This could also remove out dependency on QT which is the least permissive license in the code right now.\n\nI write code better than I design GUIs ;)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**It seems like Raiblocks is aiming to be a true currency with it's lacking of transaction fees and fast confirmation times, which is great! If Raiblocks can add some kind of support for privacy then I think it got the whole picture figured out in terms of being \"digital cash\". Do you currently have any plans to implement privacy features into RaiBlocks?**\n\n**If Raiblocks is unable to do this, it will still be a straight improvement over things like LTC which are currently being used as currency, but I don't think it will be able to become THE cryptocurrency without privacy features.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI love the concept of privacy in the network and it's a hard thing to do right. Any solution used would need to be compatible with our balance-weighted-voting method which means at least we'd have to know how much weight a representative has even if we're hiding actual account balances.\n\nTo be fully anonymous it would have to be hide accounts, amounts, endpoints, and also timing information; with advanced network analysis the timing is the hardest thing to hide. Hopefully some day we can figure out an efficient privacy solution though the immediate problem we can solve is making a transactional cryptocurrency so we're focusing on that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Could you provide an analysis on the flaws of RaiBlocks? Is it in any way, shape, or form at a disadvantage compared to a blockchain based ledger like bitcoin? There has to be drawbacks, but I haven\u2019t found any.**\n\n**Do you plan on expanding the dev team and establishing a foundation? Also, how much money is in the development pool?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOne drawback is to handle is our chain-per-account model and asynchronous updates it takes more code and design. This means instead of one top-block hash for everything there's one for each account. This gives us the power of wait-free asynchronous transactions at the cost of simplicity.\n\nAfter we finish up things like the wallet, website, and exchange integration we'll be looking at seeing what dev resources we need to build tech if no one else is already working on a particular thing. We have about 6 million XRB right now so we've made the existing dev funds go a long way. If something expensive to build came along and dev funds wouldn't cut it we could look at some sort of external funding.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_______________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**How big of a problem is PoW for exchanges and what are potential solutions?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nConsidering how much exchanges stand to make through commission I don't see the cost as a barrier, it's just an abnormal technology request compared to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWe're working on providing a service exchanges can use in the interim until they set up their own infrastructure to generate the work. Other options are containers people can use on cloud services to get the infrastructure they need until they want to invest in their own.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**It's my understanding that since everything works asynchronously, in the case of double spending there is a chance a merchant would receive the block that would be later invalidated and have it shown in it's wallet, even if a little later (1 minute?) the amount would correct when the delegates vote that block invalid. Is there any mechanism to avoid this? Maybe tag the transactions in the wallet as \"confirming\" and then \"confirmed\" after that minute? Is there actually any certain way for a wallet to know, in a deterministic/programable way, at what moment a transaction is 100% legit? (for example if the delegates are DoS'ed I guess that minute could be much longer). I know this is an improbable case, but still...**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYea you're hitting a good point, the consensus algorithm in the node is designed to wait for the incoming transaction to settle before accepting it in to the local chain for the exact reason you listed, if their transaction were to be rolled back the local account would be rolled back as well.\n\nWe can trend the current weight of all representatives that are online and voting and make sure we have >50% of the vote weight accounted for before considering it settled.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Hey Colin, will you eventually have support for a Trezor or other hard wallet?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYea we'll definitely work with companies like Trezor that are interested in being a hardware wallet for xrb. It's just a matter of making sure they support the signing algorithms and integrating with their API.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\nEDIT: I'm getting a lot of messages asking me how to buy XRB. I used this guide which was very helpful: https://www.reddit.com/r/RaiBlocks/comments/7i0co0/the_definitive_guide_to_buying_and_storing/\n\nIn short -- buy BTC on coinbase, open up an account on bitgrail, transfer that BTC from coinbase to bitgrail, then trade your BTC for XRB. It's a pain right now because it's such a new coin, but soon it will be listed on more exchanges, and hopefully on things like shapeshift/changelly. After that it will be much easier... but until then, the inconvenience is what we have to pay in order to get into XRB while its still early.\n\n________________\n\nEDIT: BAD SCRIPT, BAD!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The purpose is to isolate educational under-achievement and allocate educational resources to address this. This is part of [Digital Ethiopia 2025](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/news/digital-roadmap-developing-world), which provides insight into the timeline.\n\n[Meanwhile](https://pr.reblonde.com/world-mobile-input-output/), feasibility studies underway in Zanzibar and greater Tanzania regarding alternate mobile network technology will expand into a broader product offering connecting \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d by Q1 2022. IOG has take a 10% stake in the service provider, World Mobile.\n\nThere are also other [forward-looking](https://africa.cardano.org) statements of intent.\n\nThese announcements represent momentum for the Cardano ecosystem that aligns with the values of decentralized, locally controlled solutions that improve services and/or reduce costs. \n\nHowever, these announcements provide no revenue guidance for the ecosystem, leaving unanswered questions related to IOG reaching a position of sustainability, or more broadly Cardano being competitive not only in scale (5 million students is a lot) but in economics with respect to other blockchain solutions.\n\nHaving previously worked on blockchain deals of [large scale](https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-oict-and-lto-network-release-first-open-source-urban-land-registry-solution-for-the), and having been an investor for a long time, this missing parts of the story are significant to me. Regarding the former, the LTO activity provided no revenue traction for the entity in question. Regarding the latter, when companies do not *talk* about revenue it generally means there is no *positive* news about revenue.\n\nUntil we see announcements specifically tying large-scale economic activity with Cardano, there will remain questions about relative competitiveness with alternatives. The differentiator from LTO, ALGO, DOT and others will remain uncertain, while the position of Ethereum as the market-leader in smart contracts, native tokens or similar technology will continue unabated.\n\nThus, if this were anywhere else but a market in the midst of an investment bubble, yesterday\u2019s news would have lead to significant downward pricing pressure on ADA. \n\nFor sustainability, the key metrics to watch for in the months ahead are significant economic deals in the ecosystem and the successful deployment of smart contracts in August. If either fail to materialize in the next two quarters, Cardano will be negatively positioned against Ethereum 2.0 and potentially also against significant competitors like ALGO.\n\nIt is important to watch these things closely. Cardano\u2019s traction and upward ADA pricing depends on it.",

Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin as a way to empower individuals, wrestling the control of money from centralized institutions and banks.\n\nThen we have Ethereum, which was created to further blockchain beyond crypto payments and into a myriad of user use cases. There are now as many examples as there are projects, but today, we wish to focus on PlasmaPay.\n\n\u200b\n\nOn PlasmaPay\n\nPlasmaPay is a crypto project that aims to solve a number of different problems, all of which are related. Our vision is to make DeFi accessible for all, for individuals and businesses around the globe. A big part of that comes from fiat on- and off-ramping. For too long accessing cryptocurrency has been too complex; we believe that providing users an easy way to buy crypto with fiat will be a key factor in bringing DeFi to the masses.\n\nThe traditional economy and crypto economy have remained distant, and we wanted to create a bridge that would eliminate the gap between them. That included more than just technology and a nice-looking user interface. These are important aspects, without any doubt, but the real issue lies in being regulatory compliant with different regulators.\n\nPlasmaPay managed to receive two crypto licenses in Europe, and that helped us with proving our legitimacy to the banks and various companies around the globe. Thanks to years of work, PlasmaPay is now a trusted digital payment dApp, created on top of PlasmaChain, which can be used as a crypto wallet, an online payments account, or a crypto exchange.\n\nIt is easy to use and capable of bringing users closer to digital currencies, decentralized finance, as well as decentralized applications. Further down the road, Plasma will also tackle interoperability and many other issues, but it is important to remember that it all started with the intention of making it easy to buy cryptocurrencies and to onboard new people to possibilities of decentralized finance. Pushing mass adoption will always remain at the core of our vision and philosophy.\n\n\u200b\n\nPlasmaPay will be listed on Bithumb Glabal and Uniswap on December 10, 2020.\n\nhttps://plasmapay.com/",

It\u2019s a nice inflationary hedge,\u201d Allen said.\n\nAccepting crypto as a payment method is more difficult for companies to do, he said.\u00a0\n\nByworth said Diginex helps a lot of international companies add **Bitcoin** (CRYPTO: BTC) to their balance sheets.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFrom  the perspective of 'does it make sense?'\u00a0yeah, we are big  believers of  the inflationary hedge with the very disproportionate  reaction we\u2019ve  seen to the pandemic by central banks, which was in  fairness pretty  much their only option given all the printing that  they\u2019ve done since  2008,\u201d Byworth said.\n\nUp until  2021, Morphy said Bitfarms was in a position in which it had  to sell  almost every Bitcoin it mined just to pay the bills and invest  in  growth.\n\n\u201cIn January of this year,  we actually started a Bitcoin retention  program, and we have well over  500 Bitcoin on the balance sheet now,\u201d he  said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re  big bulls, and when you can mine a Bitcoin for under $10,000  and it\u2019s  currently in the market at between $50,000 and $60,000, what we  enjoy  doing is putting it on the balance sheet and then because that\u2019s   effectively our adjusted EBITDA, we get the compounding feature of not   just having the Bitcoin on our balance sheet from a low cost, but we   basically embed our profit in there as well to compound it.\u201d\n\n**Responding To Elon Musk:** Cryptocurrencies have come under fire this week after **Tesla, Inc.**  (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said Tesla will no longer be accepting  Bitcoin as payment due to its negative impact on the environment.\n\nBennett said DMG Blockchain uses the cheapest energy available for its mining, which is often renewable.\n\n\u201cSolar  is the cheapest energy, wind is the cheapest energy,  geothermal is the  cheapest. Iceland is a great example of that,\u201d Bennett  said.\n\n\u201cAll Bitcoin mining companies are looking for the lowest-cost energy. Any company is.\u201d\n\nWhen  asked about which cryptos their companies hold and which they  hold in  their personal accounts, the consensus among the executives is  that  they are bullish on Bitcoin and **Ethereum** (CRYPTO: ETH).\n\nNone of the panel members said their companies hold shares of **Dogecoin** (CRYPTO: DOGE) or other meme-inspired cryptos.\n\n[Source](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/05/21133168/small-cap-crypto-execs-talk-bitcoin-on-corporate-balance-sheets-it-makes-a-lot-of-sense#.YKK-GNbxm10.twitter)",

According to various media sources, the coin seems quite perspective, but the problems of Ethereum mining do not just disappear and keep us alert.\n\n**Growing DAG-file**\n\nIn the recent article, we reviewed in detail the fact that the DAG file is growing, and very soon it will not be possible to use the existing 4 GB equipment. And since it\u2019s happening in just three months you need to hurry up and decide what to do in advance!\n\n**The transition of ETH to ETH 2.0 (PoS)**\n\nNow we can only guess how the transition to 2.0 will happen and turn out to be. It is unlikely that Vitalik Buterin will let the 20-million community go. In the meantime, it is worth mining as much as you can and as profitable as possible. For example, you can take a closer look at the new CoinFLy ETH Pool, which offers more rewards than any other pool at the moment, by 10% at least. Not bad at all, isn\u2019t it?\n\n**Are There Alternatives to Ether?**\n\nDon't look for promising coins outside top-20 on whattomine. Metaverse, Quarkchain, ZANO, Haven protocol look good today. But so does RavenCoin, and its profit is good. However, some have already started mining it on ASIC. And this means that if they do not come up with any protection against ASICs, then, sorry, guys, we have nothing to do with our cards there.\n\n**Which cards should you choose?**\n\nThey write a lot about this today, and we will give our advice - get Radeon RX 570, you won\u2019t regret it! This card costs only $169 and gives out 24-30 Mh / s, which is excellent. And here are some more details on how to choose your equipment.\n\n**Legislation**\n\nRussia has not yet decided on this issue, but gradually the measures are being tightened. And, maybe, home mining will soon be banned, just like in Iran. Or they might even make this \u201charmful\u201d occupation illegal, as they did in Bolivia and Nepal. It won't be long until the final decision.\n\n**Dig deeper, spend less**\n\nDozens of videos have been filmed about fine-tuning, but people keep asking questions about how to save energy. For example, at CoinFly we are finalizing our operating system for remote farm management, and in the near future, we will roll out an automatic equipment detection and settings selecting functionalities.",

            "text": "PhoenixDAO $PHNX is Sitting at a micro market cap of $1.45 million (time of writing), we introduce our pick to lead this coming \u201calt season\u201d - PhoenixDAO $PHNX. Currently listed on Uniswap (pair link bottom of post), Bittrex, Coinex and Top 10 exchange coming\n\nThe core focus of PhoenixDAO is as to their slogan \u201cdigital identity reborn!\u201d the use of digital identity and authentication protocols to power the next generation of DeFi applications. Not only does PhoenixDAO consist of cutting edge DeFi protocols, but the project also hosts a suite of market-ready products. These products include DAO, Staking dApp, Events Marketplace, dApp Store & NFT\u2019s.\n\nThrough impressive protocols and products, PhoenixDAO has secured key strategic partnerships with Numio - Source, Ferrum Network - Source and BarterTrade - Source to be used in their upcoming applications, resulting in added $PHNX token usage.\n\n**PhoenixDAO DeFi Protocols:**\n\nIdentity: Powered by ERC-1484, this protocol both creates and links digital identities across different DeFi based dApps, apps and APIs.\n\nAuthentication: Blockchain-based 2-factor authentication protocol to verify DeFi app logins and approve transactions using your digital identity.\n\nPayments: Smart contracts to facilitate payments without a 3rd party escrow service.\n\nThese protocols are currently in the process of upgrading to incorporate Layer 2 solutions. The addition of Layer 2 solutions will dramatically make transactions faster and more cost-effective for PhoenixDAO and partner's products to eliminate Ethereum's current gas fee issues as demand increases.\n\n**Bullish Updates to Expect in Q1 2021:**\n\n* Top Tier exchange listing\n* Product launches: DAO, Events Marketplace & NFT\u2019s\n* Staking dApp version 2 to include DeFi liquidity farming\n* Numio product updates and partnership news\n\n**What is Numio?**\n\nBuilt using the PhoenixDAO protocols, Numio is bringing crypto adoption mainstream with the tech and infrastructure needed to reach the unbanked. Unbanked merchant pilots in the US (testing has already begun with Cannabis dispensaries, a $17bil market) and Africa will be launching after Numio releases their products Numio Pay and Numio Vault. Numio will allow unbanked individuals to deposit funds into their accounts via sponsored crypto ATMs and pay for items at the register with Numio Pay. Numio Vault will allow banked and unbanked merchants to accept these funds and payout suppliers or employees using local stable coins.\n\nFees are a deal-breaker in crypto transactions, so the Numio team have incorporated the Layer 2 scaling solution, zkRollups so that you pay less and your payments are settled instantly.\n\n**Numio & PhoenixDAO**\n\nThe PHNX token has been added to the Numio apps, Numio & Vault, both as a means of payment and as a utility. The payment option is self-explanatory and the utility option works as follows.\n\n* Users transferring PHNX will be eligible for \u2018cashback\u2019 rewards.\n* Every verified identity that is created on the Numio app will see PHNX being staked.\n* There will be incentives to send PHNX as part of ongoing Numio Pay Day promotions.\n* Point of Sales (PoS) fee discounts for using PHNX.\n* Numio will convert 10% of KYC revenue into PHNX and stake this in the PHNX staking dApp for the 365 staking period.\n* The 20% instant staking rewards will go to the PhoenixDAO community who can then vote on what to do with them. This includes voting to token burns.\n* Numio Authenticator will be used to access DAO software and in DAO voting identity verification.\n\nDownload the Numio Application today! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.numio.pay\n\niOS coming soon!\n\n**Numio Partners with BTI**\n\nPartnership Details: https://medium.com/numio/numio-integration-partnership-with-bti-verified-9d58d8cf20a5\n\nThrough Numio\u2019s partnership with BTI, Bithumb and BitForex have already signed up to use BTI\u2019s surveillance software accessible through Numio 2FA.\n\nNote that BTI also works closely with Binance: \u201cBTI development director Marco Paez (Also Numio CEO) told CoinDesk his research firm is working with Binance to crack down on wash trading\u201d Source\n\nIf want to learn more about PhoenixDAO or Numio:\n\n**Websites:** www.phoenixdao.io & www.numio.one\n\n**Telegram:** https://t.me/PHNXDAO\n\n**Uniswap Link:**[ **https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x38a2fdc11f526ddd5a607c1f251c065f40fbf2f7&outputCurrency=0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2**](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x38a2fdc11f526ddd5a607c1f251c065f40fbf2f7&outputCurrency=0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2)",

(TSX.V:HIVE) (NASDAQ:HVBT) (FSE:HBF) (the \" **Company** \" or \" **HIVE** \") is pleased to announce that it has ordered 1,800 Antminer S19j Pro miners from Bitmain Technologies Ltd. (\"Bitmain\"). These new miners have an aggregate hash power of 180 Petahash per second (PH/s).\n\n**Miner Purchase**\n\nHIVE is proud to reconnect with Bitmain one of the leading manufacturers in our industry and is excited to make this initial order of S19j Pro miners from Bitmain. These 1,800 miners are the first of our 2022 mining purchase program and will be delivered in 6 equal tranches of 300 miners, commencing in January 2022 through June 2022.\n\n\"We are constantly upgrading our ASIC fleet to have the most efficient miners we can buy from cash flow,\" Frank Holmes, Executive Chairman of HIVE continued, \"This purchase with Bitmain enables us to maintain our strategy to diversify the manufacturers we purchase from. Over the past year, we have been expressing our concerns about global shortages in chips and logistics delays in shipping equipment from Asia due to Covid 19. We have deep relationships Bitmain, MicroBT and Canaan which are all top global manufacturers in our industry.\"\n\nToday's miner purchase announcement is a continuation of our monthly strategy to increase our bitcoin mining capacity. HIVE intends to continue to utilize cash flow to make opportunistic investments and upgrade our fleet of BTC and ETH mining equipment on a regular monthly basis.\n\n**Biweekly Status Update**\n\nHIVE is also announcing that it expects to file its annual financial statements and accompanying management's discussion and analysis for the financial year ended March 31, 2021 (collectively, the \"Annual Filings\"), on or before August 26, 2021. The operational and reporting challenges associated with our global multi jurisdictional organization are being resolved for timely reporting in the future. This means the board and management are in a black out period and can not trade in the shares until the year end audited numbers have been filed.\n\nHIVE management confirms that it is working diligently to meet the Company's obligations relating to its Annual Filings and that, since it announced a delay of its Annual Filings (the \"Filings Notice\") there is no material change to the information set out in the Filings Notice that has not been generally disclosed and there has been no failure by the Company in fulfilling its stated intentions with respect to satisfying the provisions of the alternative information guidelines set out in NP 12-203. While subject to the MCTO, the Company will continue to comply with the provisions of the alternative information guidelines under NP 12-203 by issuing bi-weekly status reports until it has satisfied the necessary filing requirements.\n\n**HODL Update**\n\nPresently we have 25,000 ETH in cold wallets and 875 BTC. We are continuing to HODL all our bitcoins which have been mined with green energy. Our current inventory of coins invested in BTC and ETH are valued at $100 million. As mentioned in our previous press release, our annual run rate at today's bitcoin prices and difficulty is approximately $220 million. Our next milestone is to hit 1 Exahash in BTC mining by the end of this month.\n\n**About HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd.**\n\nHIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. went public in 2017 as the first cryptocurrency mining company with a green energy and ESG strategy.\n\nHIVE is a growth-oriented technology stock in the emergent blockchain industry. As a company whose shares trade on a major stock exchange, we are building a bridge between the digital currency and blockchain sector and traditional capital markets. HIVE owns state-of-the-art, green energy-powered data centre facilities in Canada, Sweden, and Iceland, where we source only green energy to mine on the cloud and HODL both Ethereum and Bitcoin. Since the beginning of 2021, HIVE has held in secure storage the majority of its ETH and BTC coin mining rewards. Our shares provide investors with exposure to the operating margins of digital currency mining, as well as a portfolio of cryptocurrencies such as ETH and BTC. Because HIVE also owns hard assets such as data centers and advanced multi-use servers, we believe our shares offer investors an attractive way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency space. HIVE traded over 2 billion shares in 2020.  \n\n\n**Source** \\- [https://ceo.ca/@accesswire/hive-blockchain-orders-1800-high-performance-miners](https://ceo.ca/@accesswire/hive-blockchain-orders-1800-high-performance-miners)",

Martin Shkreli becomes the most hated man in America by increasing by 50 the price of a drug for which he had exclusive rights on American soil. He has also been convicted of many other frauds.\n\nIt's quite intriguing I find to look at what they think about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nAlso, it is a good way to see that these former Wolves of Wall Street have inspired most of the scams that are going on today in the cryptocurrency world.\n\nIn the last issue of the In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter, I go over all of this with you in detail: [**https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/here-is-what-jordan-belfort-nick**](https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/here-is-what-jordan-belfort-nick)",

I thought the best way to start studying about cryptos would be a structured \"roadmap\" with good resources, i didnt really find anything as this online and dont have a great overview about all the different topics/importance of topics since i m new to it.\n\nI wanted to ask if anyone could provide a good Roadmap or list for what they say would be important, interesting and good  to learn about how cryptocurrencies work and could maybe provide some resources on these topics. I was thinking about keywords in a structured order which i can research on and learn about, for example something like: 1. Blockchains 2. Smart contracts ...\n\nI would also appreciate every kind of resource you could recommend.\n\nThanks in advance, if anything was unclear, please tell me and i'll try to elaborate",

I had two main thoughts on how to approach it, which are to buy weekly, to minimize how much I'm hit by random fluctuations, and to have a bunch of different kinds of crypto, to maximize the chances of one of them turning out really well. . The one downside is that I also don't have a lot of money to do this with. It seemed like Binance is one of the better ways of buying cryptos, so I made an account their, and didn't realize or think about the requirements for a single transfer. It looks like I would need to spend $20 for any single transaction. Which is not something I can afford. I was more imagining spending $20 total each month, doing a recurring $0.10 once a week for each of the 50 odd coins they have. It's looking like that just isn't an option with Binance though. Are there other ways of buying crypto that allow for small, recurring buys like that? Or am I out of luck without putting down more money, or only doing a few different kinds?\n\nEdit: Just to be clear, I'm more concerned with the minimum purchase amount, and that's more what I'm looking for help with. It sounds like recurring purchases are pretty standard, and Binance already has it, so I'm less concerned with that.",

They're usually secured by PoW (proof of work), that's the \"crypto farms\" you see in the news. An amazing video on how they work, and a bedrock foundation for crypto as a whole is [this 3b1b piece](https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4).\n\n2^nd gen is namely Ethereum, and a myriad of (significantly smaller) alternatives like Solaris or Cardano. Their hallmark feature is not only securing transactions like gen1 did, but also securing trusted code called Smart Contracts. These are pieces of code that are run on the Blockchain so anyone can verify and trust that they do what they say they do. A great YouTube channel is Finematics, in [this video](https://youtu.be/pWGLtjG-F5c) he explains the concept of Smart Contracts. Smart contracts allow for decentralised applications (dApps) to exist, basically apps that you can trust with your crypto because their code is on the Blockchain. Gen2 cryptos are secured either by PoW or increasingly by PoS (proof of stake) or similar (NPoS, PoA etc.), video on PoS [here](https://youtu.be/M3EFi_POhps).\n\n3^rd gen gets a lot more complicated, but in essence tries to facilitate interoperability between different projects (\"layer 0\"). You probably won't need to go into detail on this unless you're specifically looking to actively participate in a gen3 project like Polygon, Cosmos, or Polkadot.\n\n> how many money should I start with?\n\nThe second you hit \"buy\", assume you will never see that money again. Do not ever invest more than you are willing to lose.\n\n> I imagine a lot of you guys will say YouTube/research, but how do I distinguish whether it's reliable not misleading?\n\nIf it's about the technology, not the financials, then it's almost certainly reliable. Anyone telling you which coin is going to go up/down this week/month is not reliable. If they knew, then they wouldn't tell you unless they had more to gain from spreading the word than they do from just investing in it themselves (pump&dump). So basically trust only yourself in your picks.\n\n> How to people actually know what they're doing?\n\nA lot of people don't, they see the numbers go up so they buy, that's why scams are so prominent, especially in the world of ERC20 ETH tokens. Good channel about that is [Coffeezilla](https://youtube.com/c/Coffeezilla).\n\n> All I know so far is: Binance, most people who are trying to get you to buy into a project are doing it so they can make money, and blockchain (no idea what this means though)\n\nBinance is the biggest trading platform, as you probably know. For that reason it has become the target of many governments' regulations and crackdowns, so it can be difficult (if not impossible) to get money on/off it depending on which country you live in. A good, relatively user friendly alternative is Kraken, Coinbase, or Crypto.com. Their features are limited in comparison to Binance, but they are a good starting off point.",

If so, I struggle to understand how cryptocurrencies offer a real benefit compared to fiat currencies. Just like a bank could deny you from using your money if the system collapses, companies such as Coinbase or Binance could theoretically do the same (isn't that what kind of happened with Robinhood when GameStop stocks skyrocketed?).  \n\nWhat am I missing here?

In 5 years BTC will still be driving the market, but if ETH doesn't have near 0 fees after the upgrade, SOL and ADA will eat it up. This is because, with the high fees, peoples expectations are that ETH will fix all issues with the update. Problem is, if the update has 1 tiny issue, everybody will go ape shit and sell. As for SOL vs ADA, I think SOL will win because of the smart contract language and blazing tps (BTW, dont come at me with the validators needing 1TB of storage cause thats not accurate), although I am biased. I do think that one day we will see BTC fall just because there are so few upgrades you ever hear about, but in 5 years? Nah.",

I'm looking drop less than 100usd in three or four coins and not worry about them for a year or two. If they lose value it won't be a great loss but if they gain momentum then I'd get a good return.

It's linked to an online casino and its based in China so it's fairly steady even if it's a low value token.\n\n\nADA is relatively \"cheap\" and it's only going to increase as they go on. \n\n\nI think NANO and CRO are solid. \nNKN is looking promising so far.\n\n\nIf you stretch out the charts of any token or coin you can see if it's had pumps and dumps but I think it's important to see how ALTcoins withstand the aftermath of these events to see the long term benefits or risks. If it p&d it goes very low and stays very low until the next p&d I'd stay clear. If it has a pump and tapers off but stays steadily above where you bought in it's a good deal imo.",

CryptoCurrencies are more hyped than ever, and most people will advantage of that to advertise their dishonest projects, and take advantage of people.  \nI wish there was an easier way to read out bad intentions before we buy in, but sadly even the classic methods have failed. You could still do your homework on a project, read up on it, make sure it is legit, and then the team could be tempted to pull a rug, and they would. This is why some projects like soIana prime have gone so far as to offer an insurance fund for their investors, because as careful as you can be, you can never trust human greed.   \nIt's our nature and it'll be hard to move on, it's best to have some kind of fallback, just in case.",

While scams and rug pulls exist in crypto, people scream \"fraud!\" and \"rugpull!\" as soon as a coin starts under preforming. Mostly inexperienced investors. It's annoying. it's like people want to blame something other than themselves for picking a failing project. I've made bad picks, but I don't pick rug pulls. Maybe I'm just lucky.\n\nThe problem I think, is people not being able to spot the tell tale signs of a scam, or how to spot honest projects. People either have that sense, or don't. I've always had a keen sense for spotting bullshit, and fraudulent coins stand out to me quite easily.  I've never got rugged or scammed and I've been in and out of probably 100s of coins. But yes the insurance is a nice option, but again i think that's more for if the coin fails, not \"here's insurance in case we rug pull you\" lol. Or who knows, maybe that's a scam. How did your process of picking this coin differ from all the times you seem to have been scammed?",

Unfortunately, with the rise and power of cryptocurrencies in the markets, it seems it's all going south. \n\nThere's still hope though, because wherever I look on Twitter, when people pay attention and watch teams with an open eye, looking for something wrong, they alert everyone to it as soon as they find it, mitigating the risks within. This is a rare grassroots move unseen before, of people helping each other avoid mass risk and danger, because I still want to invest but I don't need to get rugged every time lmao. \n\nI know there are platforms like the Binance Launchpad where this is still a rare occurrence, and others like Solana Prime where they have an insurance fund in case it goes tits up, but I'm talking about the overall markets in general and how they work. \n\nIt's a shame this is happening to the crypto world, because bad controversy ruins all faith in new coins, and people are more terrified than ever to invest in startups and new tokens. How do you expect any new project to take off without any investors? \n\nHope must still remain, and this is the most valuable thing we can get when we employ any kind of secuirity against scammers and fraudsters,",

Much easier this way than to produce anything of actual value.\nEventually, the coins with actual use cases will get more and more adopted and the useless coins will fall into obscurity, the volatility will settle down, and the get rich quick crowd will look elsewhere. It will take some time though. But that's why big players like BTC call every coin a $h1tcoin because if more new people don't put their money into BTC, the hodlers won't get the big pay day they're looking for. The entire space is just the greater fool theory personified.\nSure you can get rich betting on some random coin and hope you get lucky, but I personally stick to projects with actual real world value and daily use case other than trading and speculation. Hopefully this nonsense will all be a thing of the past in 5 years.\n\nGood post, op.\nu/chaintip",

Toth, \u201cone of the biggest tragedies in life is to lose your own sense of self and accept the version of yourself that everyone else expects.\u201d Loss of self, as well as loss of life, has become a cruel reality for the people of Afghanistan (over 40 million of them). With the Taliban in charge, anarchy has taken over. As companies close, tens of thousands of people attempt to escape the nation. Furthermore, as the political system implodes, so does the financial system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfghanistan, as CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos recently noted, is \"a country running on legacy financial rails.\" This painful reckoning has resulted in a \"nationwide cash shortage,\" as well as \"closed borders, a plunging currency, and rapidly rising prices of basic goods.\" The people are desperate as the country rapidly descends into the deepest depths of despair.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to Sigalos, several of the country's banks have been \"forced to shutter their doors after running out of cash,\" owing to the country's rapid downfall. To make matters worse, Western Union has ceased operations. According to Sigalos, \u201ceven the centuries-old \u2018hawala' system ( which allows cross-border transactions ) has been shut down.\u201d The sense of despair is apparent. Afghanistan's people require aid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFortunately, local groups are trying their best to help. They are presently supporting around 20,000 Afghan people who are \"remain in the country awaiting United States officials to finalize special immigration visas.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is where the significance of cryptocurrencies enters the picture. Nonprofits are now taking Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Zcash (ZEC), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Balancer's BAL, Yearn finance's YFI, Polygon's MATIC, Synthetix Network Token (SNX), and Bancor Network Token to raise donations to transfer Afghan families (BNT). Some are even buying items on DIFX, with crypto to send them basic everyday items\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those who have questioned if crypto serves any purpose, the events in Afghanistan show how technology may truly save lives. This may appear to be exaggerated, but it is not. Aside from charities, an increasing number of Afghan civilians are turning to cryptocurrency. In the CNBC piece, Sigalos interviewed a young Afghan who feels a \u201cVenezuela-style situation\u201d is in the future. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt very well might be. According to Bloomberg, when the Taliban took control of Kabul in mid-August, the Afghan afghani (the country's currency) hit an all-time low.",

I can make up bullshit reasons why any coin in the top 100 is \"undervalued\".  DYOR, don't buy a coin because some random dude with a big audience told you to.\n\nAlso this is fundamentally flawed. Coins that over correct compared to the market are generally the worst to get in. You want coins that UNDER corrected. Over correction means people are in it for a quick buck and the support levels are super weak. ETH is case and point. It dropped considerably less than any other coin when BTC dropped 50%, then guess what happened? It made a crazy bull run up 25%+ beyond its ATH, way outperforming just about everything during the recovery.",

Now if you\u2019re more into trading and exchanging, platforms like DIFX allows you to buy crypto, stocks, forex\u2026 or if you need a friendly to use interlinked exchange platform you can use eFin\u2019s ecosystem.

I want to share with you the dashboard I have created during these last weeks and present you all the functionalities that you could use to enhance your trading strategies. A first version of the tool was involving tracking trending stocks in different social medias. But after many requests that asked for the same functionalities for Cryptos. I have created the following: \n\n# - Reddit Trending Cryptos\n\nIn the pages *Trending Stocks* Reddit, Twitter,  you have a list of the Cryptos  that have been discussed the most in each of the social network. For Reddit, you'll be also able to select a specific subreddit and time granularity to check the cryptos that have been discussed the most in these specific subreddit. You will be able to see the Current Trending Score and Previous one, to see if a recent hype is building up around a given crypto. Same for Twitter & Google\n\n# - Twitter Trending Cryptos\n\nIn this page we extract tweets that discuss each listed cryptocurrency and assign a score to the ones that are most discussed/ have most interactions in Twitter. List is updated each 30mn.\n\n# - Other functionalities\n\nWe also have the same trackers for stocks, A Fund Index that buy the most trending stocks in Reddit and show the expected performance for such a strategy, a screener to see plots of the evolutions of the different scores And lot more exciting stuff coming up.\n\nYou can check out all that at [https://unbiastock.com/crypto.php](https://unbiastock.com/crypto.php)\n\nYour comments and improvement ideas are more than welcome",

I saw a wallet called Prokey which supports many of them and I may decide buy this. Do you have any experience using this wallet? How is it?

The only wallets in crypto that cost money are hardware wallets and they are the safest, so once you build up a stack, you should look into getting one.\n\nSome things to be aware of, each wallet will have a seed phrase or private key. NEVER give that out under any circumstances, if you do, your entire wallet will be emptied. Write the seed phrase on paper and store that in a very safe place. Write it on multiple pieces of paper and store them in separate, secure places if you can. Lastly, never store it electronically, not even a screen shot of it.\n\nIf you find cons in your wallet, that you didn't purchase, don't touch them, they are scam coins designed to entice you to try and swap them. If you do, they will compromise your wallet.\n\nIf you have to use your parent to on ramp fiat or off ramp fiat, make sure you pay for the taxes your gains will incur. The tax people in what ever country you reside in will know that a crypto transaction took place and will want your parents to pay any taxes that your trading or farming have incurred, make sure to budget for that so your parents aren't getting a nasty surprise at the end of the year.\n\nGood luck on your crypto journey and stay safe out there.",

From the user\u2019s perspective, they make long or short transactions on OpenLeverage protocol, but in the actual transaction process, two steps are taken. The first step is to borrow from the lending pool, and the second step is to trade in DEX.  \nCurrently, OpenLeverage utilizes the depth of Uniswap and will integrate more Dexs liquidity sources in the future which is a very important trait that differentiates OpenLeverage from other products.",

Don\u2019t keep screenshots on your phone, don\u2019t email yourself the words, don\u2019t write them down and leave them in your wallet.

By adding Metadata to transactions you can automate all kinds of transactions, the metadata will contain the public key of the recipient of the transaction, proving that that transaction took place in a particular block in the chain.\n\nthe benefits of this is you can prove ownership of something without a need for having much identifying personal information required from a practical or technical standpoint.\n\nas an example, event tickets could be sold as NFTs, owning the NFT ticket proves your ticket is real, your signature proves you are the owner. this would make scalping fake tickets impossible, it would also allow the reselling of tickets in online marketplaces very convenient, the issuer could even include a clause where each time a ticket is resold they collect a fee. this would reduce demand of customers who are buying tickets to speculate on them.\n\nvehicle titles. we could completely cut auto dealers out of the picture for buying and selling vehicles. ownership of vehicals could be verified on a blockchain. leases and auto loans could be completely transparent. we could have standardized terms that are chosen by market demand where anyone could list or purchase from anyone, anyone could provide liquidity for the loans and earn profits from them.\n\npretty much any their party dealer for anything we commonly use some service to find the best deals on anything, vacations, air travel, cars, deeds, leases can use a combination of smart contracts and NFTs that represent actual property could possibly become a peer to peer market that would allow both parties to get the most competitive terms by cutting out brokers, and anyone could benefit from it from any angle.\n\nemails can do this because while emails create records the servers they are on must be maintained and the information on them is not probably assured to be maintained permanently, and the information can be interacted with easily as emails are private and not instantly verifiable. \n\nthink of everything the internet has brought us, not think how crypto has the potential to remake all of it in a way that eliminates a need for a third party to facilitate verifying your personal information, storing your data and sharing that information only in approved ways.",

Never use that phone for anything else, and it should be good. \n\nTaking that idea a security step further: having transferred your cryptos and ofc saved your seed phrase, you can then actually just delete Metamask, because you can restore it anytime you need to, just using the seed. \n\nIn fairness, I don't actually fully understand hardware ledgers, because to my admittedly limited understanding, your coins and your ownership of those blocks is still registered on the blockchain anyway, and so the best security is going to have no physical evidence of ownership, apart from your seed phrase. Correct me if I'm wrong.",

            "text": "REPOST: This post was deleted by moderators at r/Metamask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe metamask has been infiltrated by bad actors. This is an odd story, but extremely serious. For backstory I have a lot of experience in crypto.\n\nRead Below\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 1: Metamask transaction issue starts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 3: Submitted support ticket at [metamask.zendesk.com](https://metamask.zendesk.com)\n\nNOTE: The email that I used is a custom domain email, it has existed for less than six months and it has only been used on 1 website previous to this day. That website is axie infinity. I have never received a single spam email to this domain. So there's no possible way anyone could have known this email.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 7: Reply received from: [metamask.recoveryteam@gmail.com](mailto:metamask.recoveryteam@gmail.com) (obvious scam) The email stated \"...please provide the wallet's 12-word seed phrase...\"\n\nScreenshot of reply: [https://i.imgur.com/ai4dTYx.png](https://i.imgur.com/ai4dTYx.png)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday: Ticket on zendesk mysteriously disappeared.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFACTS:\n\nScammer knew I had submitted a support ticket\n\nScammer knew an extremely private domain name and the primary email attached to it; that was impossible to know outside of metamask and axie infinity staff.\n\nI still have this issue and I still need actual metamask support. I have submitted a new support ticket today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThere are two plausible conclusions. Conclusion 1, scammer has hacked into zendesk and modified the support tickets. Conclusion 2, scammer is a support staff member at metamask.\n\nIf you apply Occam's Razor to this issue, conclusion 2 becomes the most likely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlternative ways this is playing out with other users at this moment:\n\nThere are three logical ways this scam can go, they are listed below.\n\n1. Email is ignored as an obvious scam, while yes this prevents funds from getting stolen the obvious drawback is the user still needs real support.\n\n2. User replies with seed phrase. All users assets are stolen.\n\n3. User responds with obscenities, I considered this path but it's not the right way to do things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPOTENTIAL SOLUTIONS:\n\n1. Educate users more so on cryptocurrencies, this has already been done though various warnings when creating a wallet. Little more can be done here.\n\n2. Metamask providing better support. I'm confident metamasks support is always improving as should be any companies support. Never the less you can always improve.\n\n3. Use custodial wallets, the issue with this is you don't own the assets, it's no different than having money in a bank account. This is a silippery slope to additional loss of freedom that the crypto market once provided.",

Jesus shows up and says that the world's banking/currency systems are corrupted, so let's create our own currency...the ChristCoin.  And then, overnight, hundreds of millions of people around the world adopt/buy/use it from then on.  \n\nBy starting this new coin, is Jesus able to make a ton of money from it, from the start, such that he could fund billions of dollars worth of new churches all around the world, or is he no different from any other new user and doesn't make a penny...?    \n\nDoes whoever starts a successful coin become instantly wealthy?  Do they keep a huge portion of it?  Is it similar to a company going public and selling shares, where the originator/owner can keep 51% of the shares?    \n  \nEssentially, is it possible to become 'instantly' (very) wealthy by starting a coin, if there is widespread adoption of that coin?  Is all it takes, really, is adoption?  If adoption is big enough (like via the charm/popularity/outreach of a 'Jesus'), could someone become a billionaire 'from nothing', so long as they have the initial technical infrastructure to offer a cryptocurrency...?\n  \nSorry if these are clueless questions.  I'm struggling to get my head around it.  And when I search around on the web for answers pretty much everything I'm finding is geared toward educating users on how crypto works for users (rather than originators).",

Even if one defeats inflation with a hard supply of 21 million, if every transaction can be monitored, traced and taxed, the means of transferring wealth away from someone to another still exists.  Currently the governments preferred method is by way of inflation but that doesn't mean it always has to be that way.  In fact, if you remove the method of wealth transfer by way of inflation, it's almost guaranteed they will just increase wealth transfer by taxation.  It has recently been discussed in the form of unrealized capital gains taxes.  As long as every transaction can be traced and tracked, it can be taxed.  The hard cap limit alone falls short of what is required for weath preservation.",

It can operate as a full node or a light wallet, you can stake, or cold stake easily to earn passive income. You can even vote on project proposals directly from your mobile device.\n\nThe latest feature to be supported by NEXT is Navcoin's private transactions using [xNAV](https://medium.com/nav-coin/navcoin-is-becoming-a-high-utility-privacy-platform-c05945828c02). Navcoin uses a combination of BLS signatures and Confidential Transactions to successfully hide the sender, receiver and the transaction amounts. The Navcoin blockchain operates two tokens, the public NAV and the private xNAV. You can perform a 1:1 swap between NAV and xNAV at anytime for however many coins you wish, to switch between the private and public tokens directly in the wallet.\n\nThe latest version of NEXT wallet adds the ability to swap coins and send private transactions on both desktop and mobile. This is made possible with NEXT's implementation of the new [navcoin-js](https://github.com/aguycalled/navcoin-js) library authored by Navcoin core lead engineer Alex Vazquez. An exciting development meaning Navcoin's private transactions can be implemented into any javascript based project with ease.\n\n[https://medium.com/nav-coin/privacy-is-in-the-palm-of-your-hands-now-next-wallet-with-support-for-private-transactions-has-6331a50392a9](https://medium.com/nav-coin/privacy-is-in-the-palm-of-your-hands-now-next-wallet-with-support-for-private-transactions-has-6331a50392a9)\n\nBinance have also just enabled the direct withdrawal of xNAV from their exchange, which makes using Navcoin's private transactions even easier and secure, eliminating the extra step of withdrawing to a public address from the exchange and then swapping the coins to xNAV manually.\n\nIt's an exciting step towards widely available financial privacy for the Navcoin and wider cryptocurrency community. The ability to withdraw private xNAV directly from Binance to your mobile phone, anywhere in the world, is truly a great leap forward.\n\nhttps://navcoin.org",

The targeting insights show that this should turn drive around 30,000 new site visits per month!\n\nThe campaign will have a lot of facets because there are so many awesome things to talk about within this project. Launched in 2014 Navcoin has consistently been releasing industry leading technology over the seven years since it was started. It's like the swiss army knife of cryptocurrencies, you can do a bit of everything.\n\nLow cost and fast public or private transactions using industry leading cryptography. Passive income with staking (8.5%), private transaction mixing and liquidity farming (37% APY). Wrapped coins on ETH and BSC with bridges between the main chain and Pancakeswap and Uniswap. It's eco friendly since it's proof of stake. It launched in 2014 with no pre-mine or ICO, so it's completely run by the community. It has the most advanced DAO in the industry with proposal voting and autonomous proposal payments directly on-chain.\n\nWe are looking forward to what the future holds for the Navcoin platform and excited about the new exposure the marketing campaign will bring for the project!",

As a result, this could mean less demand by consumers and less investment by companies.\n\nAlso, if the FED\u2019s tapering manages to reduce inflation, the demand for Bitcoin among institutional investors could potentially drop.\n\nOne final red flag mentioned by Guy is the FATF\u2019s crypto \u201crecommendations\u201d and a potential global crackdown on cryptocurrency in the name of money laundering.\n\n**Bob Loukas, who at this point enjoys a prestigious trader status for all the accurate predictions he\u2019s made in the past**, shared this chart in his last youtube video published on the 15th of October (notice the dip around mid-November):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Frame grab from \\\\\"On Your Marks - 4 Year Journey\\\\\" by Bob Loukas Youtube video](https://preview.redd.it/eod2xxfbmsy71.png?width=1913&format=png&auto=webp&s=d354743a99851dea7cdd5e4081090ace4aa0c41d)\n\n**TechDev\\_52, a must-follow on Twitter (who also seems to always hit the hammer on the nail with his charts and analysis)**, published this interesting comparison chart:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: TechDev\\_52 Twitter](https://preview.redd.it/jb6v9ekfmsy71.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f415ca902b89a562794d364e37182a0e25fcf4b)\n\nHe is comparing the 2017 bull run - which had a significant pullback around mid-November - to the current market situation, and also projects a dip around the same time frame.\n\nWhy one last dip would be beneficial to the market\n\n**From where I\u2019m standing, this event would serve two purposes:**\n\n1. The obvious opportunity to stack more sats, both for seasoned investors and newcomers. By now, the veterans are most likely comfortable with their holdings and may or may not capitalize in the event of a dip.  \nFor newcomers though, it\u2019s a completely different story, as they love to ask their crypto savvy friends \u201cis this a good time to buy?\u201d. This retrace would provide the affirmative answer and one last opportunity to increase the inflow of new investors at a crucial phase, accelerating adoption and boosting the final market capitalization for this cycle.\n2. This could also further extend the cycle well into the first quarter of 2022. Extending the cycle could also allow for more hype and proliferation, and thus achieve a higher top.\n\nTLDR\n\nEveryone and their dog is super bullish. There are clear skies ahead for BTC to reach 100k+, but some experts believe we are due for a correction before we resume the run to the top of this cycle.\n\n**What are your thoughts on this?**\n\nI\u2019m expecting the retrace to happen at any moment now and personally keeping dry powder to **BUY THE DIP!**",

I have been investing in cryptos since 2017, but it was only until recently that I really considered pursuing cryptos as a career. I figured the first step was to educate myself more on everything crypto. In my free time I began listening to a bunch of podcasts, watching various Youtube videos, trying to learn trading patterns and trends, and began taking online coding courses. In this process, I found that while it is easy to find a plethora of online resources about crypto, most of them are about relevant crypto news and upcoming projects. I found that it is difficult to find information to educate myself on the technical side of cryptos so I can have a really firm foundation and understanding about what they are, how they work, and how they are going to affect the financial world. Basically, I want to educate myself enough so that I am a useful asset to hire in the future and have knowledge to offer future employers. I am in the process of applying for internships with crypto startups because I figured that would be a useful way to learn a lot. But, basically my questions are: 1) Where can I find the best educational information about cryptos? 2) Which programming languages would be the most useful for me to learn? (I learned SQL yesterday, but don't know what to learn next) and 3) What are the best ways to get involved and connected with other people in the crypto community? Thanks!",

However one frustrating con is that it makes it easier for scams to brew up.\n\nThe stock market has things like Nasdaq that make thorough research before listing an stocks there. In fact there are even some cryptocurrencies like EQONEX on Nasdaq. This provides a lot more trust in my opinion.\nSo why can\u2019t we have a similar trusted body in the crypto market that verifies and monitors projects to see if they\u2019re a scam or not?",

Bitcoin has entered almost every part of our lives and I don\u2019t know a man who hasn\u2019t heard about it.\n\nThat China situation shows that there\u2019re ppl who still don\u2019t see btc potential. I understand that they want to develop their own cryptos, and it\u2019s working out great for them.  They have some projects and they\u2019re actually promising. I guess if there wasn\u2019t China with its statements, I wouldn\u2019t discover for myself Wabi or Elastos. For example, as I understand, Wabi aims to prevent fake or low-quality products by scanning them. I feel that there\u2019s smth interesting out there and China might have future with crypto.\n\nAnd on the other hand we have Salvador that has made a great breakthrough for Btc. Though I\u2019m scared that the mass adoption of BTC by not the largest country will seriously burden the cryptocurrency network. By the way last weekend, the network was overloaded and the transaction cost set a new record. The increase in the activity of Bitcoin network users, will make the network inconvenient to work with and, in addition, will increase fees. So I\u2019m so excited to see how it will end for crypto and Salvador.\n\nBesides Btc, there\u2019re also the Ether network and the new Solana, which is ten times more powerful. But they are much further from mass adoption than btc. And this is not only a technological, but also a marketing issue.\n\nEverything is clear with Btc, but do you think the Ether will also pull out mass adoption? After all, both Wabi and Elastos are on it. Maybe in 10 years there will be one Solana at all for both utility tokens and cryptocurrencies? Do you think technological victory over marketing and recognition is possible here?",

None of the bans covered the same scope or were reversed except for the Apr 2019 ban. They each covered different aspects of cryptocurrency.\n\n**List of Bans in PRC (excluding HK)**\n\n1. 2013, Dec: Financial institutions banned from making or handling Bitcoin transactions.\n1. 2014, Apr: Commercial banks and payment companies must close existing Bitcoin trading accounts\n1. 2017, Feb: Crypto exchanges required to come into full compliance with anti-money laundering rules\n1. 2017, Sept: Domestic crypto exchanges banned. 173 trading platforms close or move abroad\n1. 2017, Sept: Crypto ICOs banned\n1. 2019, Apr: Partial ban on crypto mining as an industry. This was later reversed in Nov 2019.\n1. 2021, Apr-May: Multiple provinces individually begin banning cryptocurrency mining and mining equipment\n1. 2021, May: Financial institutions now banned from providing services to all cryptocurrencies. Previous ban was on Bitcoin only, and only covered transactions.\n1. 2021, June: Full ban on cryptocurrency mining and mining equipment, now country-wide. Global hash rate plunges.\n1. 2021, Sept (now): Ban on cryptocurrency trading by individuals, even when using foreign exchanges/accounts.\n\nYou might notice that this isn't a **full** ban on crypto since individuals can still **own** crypto. They just can't trade it. So there could be 1 more ban to come. However, unlike existing laws, it's completely unenforceable.\n\nThis history somewhat resembles a cat-and-mouse game where China continues banning new things as people find different ways to circumvent existing laws.\n\n**Sources**:\n\n1. https://investorplace.com/2021/09/how-many-times-has-china-banned-crypto-11-things-to-know-about-the-regulatory-timeline/\n1. https://www.btctimes.com/news/chinas-history-of-bitcoin-bans\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country_or_territory\n1. https://www.reuters.com/business/more-chinese-provinces-issue-bans-cryptomining-2021-06-11/\n1. https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202106/1226598.shtml\n1. https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/06/chinese-agency-scraps-plan-to-eliminate-bitcoin-mining-industry/\n1. https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/04/chinas-central-bank-has-banned-icos/\n1. https://fortune.com/2021/09/24/china-bans-crypto-bitcoin-buying-opportunity-historical-averages/",

I can see some things in crypto that I think we can definitely see mass adoption with like DAOs and in game currencies and NFTs. I also have a decent idea on how bitcoin can be just as good or better than gold. \n\nWhat im not seeing is how we are going to mass adopt crypto as a form of payment used all the time by tons of people to buy anything. What is the reason people will decide they want to convert to cryptocurrencies. Normies don\u2019t care about decentralization or an on chain data base or the advancement in tech or really any of the stuff us crypto enthusiast care about. \n\nHow is crypto going to make there life easier/better for day to day payments, even with the(im pretty sure I havnt actually used it) virtually 0 transaction fees with arbitrum. We already get 0 fees buying stuff online with debit. We are only generally paying fees for cross country payments or large wire transfers(if thats correct ive never done either of those before). But I think you probably get the point if the question by now. \n\nIm thinking maybe it doesn\u2019t really have to do with the users and just the fact its a superior form of money so even large traditional banks will start using it as a medium in there day to day transactions. Ive heard a thesis before that even traditional banks may end up being sort of a front end to cryptocurrency and sort of defi. I thought that was interesting. Id like to hear you ppls thoughts on all of this. I\u2019m just a noob in the space and dont know much so sorry if I got something wrong.",

This was part of a push to go into digital assets.\n\nBigger Picture: About a dozen other financial companies have submitted similar applications to the SEC. All of them are still pending. The SEC does not appear to be moving towards approval anytime soon.\n\nExperts Weigh In: In August, an analyst with Bloomberg predicted that the SEC will approve of a Bitcoin Futures ETF as early as October.\n\nFinal Thoughts: A Bitcoin ETF or a Bitcoin Futures ETF provides a way for more investors to get exposure to cryptocurrency investments.\n\nHope you enjoyed this commentary.

            "text": "I know this is somewhat of a controversial stance but I don\u2019t think coin swaps should be considered a taxable event. Trading for any stable coin should be taxable, however if you are only trading within the cryptocurrency asset class, your trades may be unprofitable in the coins that you traded but still profitable in USD-yet you haven\u2019t taken any usd out as profit.\n\nThe asset class is highly correlated because of the trading pairs that we have established. this is not surprising because it\u2019s how most asset classes work. Like real estate for example. Except with real estate you can avoid tax liability by reinvesting the profit and paying a lump sum tax later on when you cash out. If we allow traders to reinvest and pay taxes later they will end up making more profit and the government will also get more tax revenue in the long run.",

Copy and pasting one of my older comments from 2 weeks ago:\n\nYeah it's insane what's currently possible with DeFi. Golden wild west months/years righ now before regulation comes. There are actually a couple of really cool and solid ways to earn passive income, such as getting interest while holding and still having access/control over your bags (such as Celsius for example), or liquidity mining and staking where you get everything from moderate APY to insane percentages in the hundreds. Pancake/Uniswap was mentioned already, there's DeFi on the Bitcoin blockchain going on too such as Svrgn, Stacks and DeFi Chain/Cake Defi for example. All above mentioned solid and recommended. I'm using all of them in equal parts (so if one doesn't succeed my funds are decentralised), and yet have to say the (in my opinion!) safest and easiest way to earn some great passive income is with DeFi Chain and the on-ramp service Cake Defi .\n\nThere are a couple of nice ways, do your dd before signing up for anything, though. And if you sign up, ask people for ref links as both parties usually profit. :)\n\nHope this helps a bit. If you have questions, happy to help (not in DM's, never trust people who write you DM's about crypto).\n\nEdit: 'Hope this helps' instead of 'Hide this helps'",

The people who came up with the scheme on r/wallstreetbets bought lots of GME before they started pumping it (and others bought early on while the price was still at a normal level).  It was a pump and dump scheme like what happens often on that sub-Reddit, just with this \"let's do it to screw over rich people\" angle to make it appealing to the Reddit way of thinking, and people bought it and it became a wildly successful scheme.\n\nOne of them bragged that he made multiple millions of dollars off this (I forget the exact number).  But people still are buying the idea that it's somehow about helping poor people or something, and there are people still trying to buy it now because their David & Goliath narrative has taken on a life of its own.  But eventually the stock is going to return to a reasonable valuation of the actual company's value, and everyone still holding the bag are going to get burned.",

At some point in time your going to have to realize your gains. Granted for each individual that point in time may be different. But nonetheless the point of the bigger picture is to stick it to the schmucks o n Wall Street. By watching your gains plummet to their inevitable death is essentially letting these hedgies win. \n\nI worked for a hedge fund for 7 years, now day trade crypto at home for a living. And even as a small pawn in the big Wall Street game, I still saw overtly gross manipulation of the market (more so on our current and potential future positions) on an astronomical scale just within those few short years. One of the main reasons I decided to walk away, just morals and pure disgust of the game. \n\nIt\u2019s quite obvious who has leaned on these beginner trading platforms to squeeze them to cut out any new longs. There was a conference call that took place with a few players who I\u2019m sure downright threatened the RobinHoods and such with their muscle and what their capable of if they did not agree to the play. Therefore cutting off the main vein of the Reddit Retard Regalia. Under the guise of \u201cconsumer protection\u201d for legality reasons of course. But obviously disgusting manipulation of a heavily regulated market that benefits only the few chosen ones at the top who broke bread with the OG regulators to begin with. \n\nMake a long story short, you must realize gains at some point in time. Wether it be once you get to the moon or right before you land. Not before not after. (Generally speaking of course) \n\n*** for any Reddit warriors reading this who want to continue the good fight but cannot due to Robinhood and whatever other apps out there, if you have $500 go open a TD Ameritrade account. Takes 36-72 hours to KYC validate but you can still purchase stocks etc. in $GME $AMC  and such, just can\u2019t on margin (leverage) \n\nBut good on ya for the post. I\u2019m here with you and everyone else who\u2019s fighting. \n\nI bought in at $2k shares of $GME. @ $24 booked profits on about 50% @ $438. Still holding almost half the positions with no intent to sell after those incredibly massive realized gains to help hold the line for the remaining fellow retards. \n\n$$$$$$$$$$$Retarded since birth$$$$$$$$$$$$\n\nMay your gains be plentiful as your stop losses never execute! \n\n***this is not financial advise and should not be taken as such***",

I don't buy that bullshit that if people take advice from a celebrity, they are just getting what they deserve. Especially when that celebrity is one of the great entrepreneurs of our time. I also don't think senior citizens who get scammed, or people who get phished, are just getting what deserve.\n\nIf you are an OG trader making bank swing trading, I'm happy for you. If you legitimately think it's a currency that has a place in the future, that's fine too. I surely don't get to pick which currencies will survive. But telling a bunch of too trusting novices who know nothing about crypto to dump their money into it at the ATH and after a 2600% increase just for the laughs is loathsome.",

You're still early to the game, just keep stacking, and hang with us!\n\nThanks all for making this sub a great seat for this wild roller coaster ride. Let's all age prematurely together in this stress fest to the moon.  Keep those laser eyes focused!\n\nThis sub is a global community. As crypto becomes more and more accessible to everyone, we must remember that we are all connected with each other, and our planet, and can be part of the change we keep waiting to see.\n\nOur most powerful vote is with our money. Crypto/decentralization of finance breaks a psychological barrier in our minds that centralized forces (who are in control of these systems) are not pleased with, and would rather you stop exploring. Keep educating yourselves and having words and repertoire needed to start questioning their authority. The most dangerous question to ask is \"Why?\"\n\nHere's to sustainable crypto adoption, the decentralization and true democratization of power through our collective vote to shift the tides of doom, to put lights in the dark places where evil hides and thrives, and to providing a hope for a better tomorrow for all of us global citizens.\n\nSincerely,\n\n-r/Cryptocurrencies mod team\n\nedit: grammar\n\nedit 2: CCP is not a country, neither is Putin. Please notice I DID NOT attack or call out any country, just the oppressive forces that damage those AMAZING countries, their culture, and the people within who are just trying to live a peaceful life free from fear. Yes there are bad actors at work in virtually every country in the world, but let's give the spotlight in this moment to Pooh and Putin, m'kay?",

A simple centralized database system will be exponentially faster.  If it needs to be authenticated, then cryptographic signatures can be added.  Such a system will operate faster and more reliably than anything on the blockchain.\n\nMost importantly, these existing supply chain management systems are already in place and work great.  They're faster and more reliable.  They don't require paying any transaction fees and waiting to find out if the data has been accepted or rejected.  And they're not dependent upon other technology that's being used for everything from money laundering to extortion.  \n\nThis is a great example of a solution looking for a problem.  Supply chain doesn't have any problems blockchain can fix or solve.  Blockchain just makes everything slower, more expensive and less reliable.",

The technical indicators are showing an extremely bullish breakout pattern emerging--imminently!\n- There will be an airdrop for all token holders as soon as 500 wallets are holding $yplt token.\n\nCheck out https://yplutus.finance and DYOR if you are interested.",

I researched the team and their project, they have a proprietary blockchain built on zero that can operate twice the speed of eos. Short and sweet of it is buying this is like buying zeroswap for Elrond network when it was undervalued or like buying sushi for eth when it was pennies per token. However this will be integrated with the plutus capital lending app as part of roadmap. This means buying the token is slightly like buying the Celsius token (if you want to think of it that way). The dev has a good reputation and is a member of Poland blockchain chamber of commerce. From what I see they have a keep your head down and work mentally (kinda like harmony). Not advising anyone to buy or not to I\u2019m not giving advice but I can say research hard on this project and their ecosystem you will not be disappointed... they also have a yplt debit cart in the works. \nAlso I like the token, good tokenomics as well. \n\nLook out for their plt and p smart contracts coming soon",

One day protest erupted in the country, and the local currency got devalued by more than 8x. Today the state & banks decided that I no longer have a right to spend my own money and created capital controls. We are now allowed 100$ per week, and with regards to students that are abroad, they are allowed 1000$ a month including rent.   \n\n\nBanks and the state have the power to take the money that you have in the bank and limit your withdrawals because simply the money that you have in the bank is not yours. Society lives under the illusion that they have financial freedom when in reality we do not.  A lot of you will think, my country will never do this, and my economy is too strong to crash. \n\nWell, trust me this is not the case, the only solution to this is decentralization, where no one has control over your money except you.  With crypto, you are your own bank, the power lies with you. That balance that you see when you open online banking, is nothing but a lie, just look at China, they imposed capital controls to prevent people from withdrawing \"unreasonable amount of money\". If it's your money, how is it unreasonable for you to withdraw it?",

Each transaction (buy and sell) incurs a 12% transaction tax from which 6% goes to liquidity and 6% distributed to holders according to their stake.\n\n**Liquidity is locked** on a daily basis rolling for 4 years.\n\n1T daily burn for the first 50 days. Additional regular burn of liquidity to try and keep as close as possible to 10% circulating supply. The burn address is also a \"HODLer\" so it gets a share of the 6% tax based on its stake which is currently about 4% - but this will grow exponentially.  \n**Check the burn wallet on BSC scan:** 0xFAd8E46123D7b4e77496491769C167FF894d2ACB?a=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001\n\nWe are really starting to notice the momentum now, and the number of FOX wallets and numbers participating with our social media has really started to take off. **We currently have 9,757 holders and we have planned something special when we reach 10K!**\n\n**Our ERC-721 NFT contract is now deployed and fully functional on mainnet!** We are one of only a few projects on the BSC network to have achieved this. We have just teased a beta of our upcoming NFTs, which will start with HODL badges and other memorabilia - but we have paired up with some amazing 3D and AI artists - watch this space! Congratulations Roy (@waarismijnpost) for being the proud winner of our first public NFT!\n\nOn April 5th, we hosted an AMA (\"Ask me anything\") on our Discord where the owner L1sak revealed his public identity and told us to expect **FOX FINANCE to be granted LLC public entity status** within days! After becoming increasingly disenfranchised with the current state of the cryptocurrency culture and with BSC in particular, his vision is to legitimize the space and offer holders a project that is legitimate, legal, trusted, open and offering lucrative investment opportunity whilst also giving back to the environment and the natural world.\n\nOur model incorporates a constant flow of **\"FOX IN ACTION\"** campaigns on our website foxfinance .io. Wallet-drop prizes are awarded for all holders who perform certain tasks like charitable giving, planting trees or using metal straws instead of one-use plastic. Our founder hopes in the medium-longer term to streamline these campaigns and integrate them into iOS and android App development to make this more accessible for the general public. #foxinaction\n\n**Check out our Twitter page today for a 25 Billion $FOX giveaway.** (foxfinancebsc)\n\nWe have recently become integrated with Trust Wallet (logo showing) and have beta integration with Metamask (working more consistently on PC's at the moment).\n\nI'm a HOLDer since the start and have volunteered as a forum mod on Telegram, which I have to say has been a pleasure and it's one of the most buzzy and active telegram communities I have had the pleasure of joining.\n\n**Youtube video release today!!! (German Speakers) - Kryptow\u00e4hrung News - Alles zu Kryptos & Aktien - go and check it out!**\n\nThanks [u/SION42x](https://www.reddit.com/u/SION42x/) for compiling below\n\n**SAFU?**\n\nLiquidity is locked: [https://deeplock.io/lock/0x3027AD7781700A03496613377152dBa78C38fa55](https://deeplock.io/lock/0x3027AD7781700A03496613377152dBa78C38fa55)\n\nThis is no pump and dump. The owner did not take advantage of the ATH, and the admins are all HODLing with everyone else. We really want to see this coin grow and to fund our tech roadmap to make this a real project for change.\n\n**ROADMAP PLANS** \ud83d\udcc8\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s on the horizon:\n\n**NFTs** \\- We have two different types of NFTs. One is a standard, mass-minted NFT that we hope to use for HODLers, airdrops etc. These have launched and are already being offered to FOX contest winners via our social media campaigns. These include fun things like FOX graphics and GIFs. The other type of NFT we want to start pushing very soon are more unique and include things like 3D printable FOX content, AI art, and more collectible style FOX merchandise. I'm really excited about this one!\n\n**Charity Matching and Escrow** \\- This is important to us. It\u2019s how we plan to get money to the organizations that need it for our mission. We\u2019re working on escrow contracts and other possibilities for collecting FOX donations, possibly with matched by liquidity from NFT auctions. We are working with our legal team to get this approved and in place as soon as possible. These donations will go directly to charitable wildlife and environmental organizations, possibly through The Giving Block, a crypto donation provider. We have several community members who have already donated to WildlifeAidUK, World Wildlife Fund and Saveafox. At the moment, Binance Smartchain does not have the NFT auction infrastructure in place for the kinds of things we are looking to do. At the moment, they are closed markets. Bakeryswap and NFTKey are the biggest - but no open markets, no API's and no projects made to work on it for marketplace building. We are hoping to build a decentralized platform ourselves for NFT interaction, exchange and auction.\n\n**Admin Dashboard** \\- Right now things like Airdrops and prize disbursements aren't easy on BSC. It's mostly done manually with wallet to wallet transfers or interactions through the contract done by someone with credentials. The goal here is for us to have a dApp that combines contracts and web3 code to make it easy to do mass airdrops, awards, NFTs, etc.\n\nWebsite: FOXFINANCE .

We have an organized and dedicated team working to consistently deliver on our roadmap promises, but it would be reasonable to expect higher market volatility at this early stage. We have applied for Coin Gecko and Coin Market Cap listing and have confirmed that our application is all in order - we are waiting on this and hope to hear some good news soon, but it is not a priority for us. We are keen to build the largest level of ground-level support, legitimacy and technical roadmap completion possible in order to make our listings an explosive force multiplier for FOX value growth!

As crypto becomes more and more accessible to everyone, we must remember that we are all connected with each other, and our planet, and can be part of the change we keep waiting to see.

Crypto/decentralization of finance breaks a psychological barrier in our minds that centralized forces (who are in control of these systems) are not pleased with, and would rather you stop exploring.

The most dangerous question to ask is \"Why?\"\n\n**Humanity DESERVES Liberty, Sovereignty, and Freedom. Crypto can solve this.**\n\nWould George Washington, Ben Franklin, Ghandi, Nelson Mandela, JFK have HODLed?\n\nHere's to sustainable crypto adoption, the decentralization and true democratization of power through our collective vote to shift the tides of doom, to put lights in the dark places where evil hides and thrives, and to providing a hope for a better tomorrow for all of us global citizens.

            "text": "Crypto is a difficult world to get your footing in. There are just as many pump and dump meme coins and outright scams as there are legitimate projects; and many of those legitimate projects are just an idea without anything tangible behind it (just wait two years and it will be revolutionary\u2026right?).   \n\nI\u2019ve been accumulating crypto since early 2017 and am currently as excited as everyone else to be going through my second major bull run.   \n\nAt the beginning of 2021, I converted 99% of my stack to Smartlands (SLT).  \n\n*Here are 32 reasons why:*  \n\n***Tokenomics***  \n\n1. **Supply** \\- the total supply is 7.1mil tokens with just over 5mil currently in circulation. Remaining tokens are locked for use onboarding partners, so will only be unlocked when there is real gain for the platform to be had by doing so.  \n2. **Market Cap** \\- even after the 30x fiat value gains that SLT has had since January, the market cap is still under 50mil. That is insanely undervalued for a project with as many fundamentals as Smartlands has.  \n3. **Staking Yield** \\- Smartlands will be providing [revenue sharing to qualifying holders](https://smartlands.io/blog/the-fee-pool-and-ukraine-explained/) of 33% of fees paid by clients to list assets on their platform; as well as a percentage of trading fees from the secondary market that emerges over time.  \n4. **Buy Pressure** \\- the staking yield will be paid to holders in SLT and this will be bought on market through automated buy bots, creating an upward pressure on price.  \n5. **Near-Zero Fees** \\- because SLT operates on the Stellar protocol (easily one of the best crypto protocols in the world) the transaction fees are basically free.  \n6. **Fast Transactions** \\- the Stellar protocol also allows transactions on the platform that occur in a few seconds.  \n\n**7) Environmentally Friendly** \\- there is minimal energy use for the Stellar protocol and therefore the Smartlands platform will be more environmentally friendly compared to most other cryptocurrency blockchains.  \n\n8) **Transparent** \\- one of the great things about the Stellar protocol and the Stellar Decentralised Exchange (SDEX) is how transparent it is. You can see every trade, linked to an account, with analytics about that wallet available for anyone to see ([Stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/)). This lets us understand market sentiment and whale activity better than pretty much any other platforms out there.  \n\n9) **New Exchanges Coming** \\- SLT is currently so undervalued (did I mention: UNDER 50mil MARKET CAP) because it has only been available on the SDEX until recently. Two new exchanges have been added so far in 2021 (Whitebit and Atomars) with more currently in negotiations. Once SLT hits any of the larger exchanges you know what will happen\u2026 and you have that to look forward to if you become a holder now.  \n\n10) **Bear Market Resistant** \\- one of the great things about a platform focused on a real world business model is that it is less dependent on the crypto market cycles for success. Everything goes great for all these obscure DeFi plays in a bull run, but what happens to them when the market turns? 90% of them will disappear or become worthless, but Smartlands will continue to run its business as it is not solely focused on crypto investors. The yield is also not dependent on the crypto markets, but is a factor of commercial activity. SLT is bear market resistant, which will become increasingly important over the course of 2021.  \n\n***Platform***  \n\n11) **Real Estate** \\- the Real Estate market is the next holy grail of crypto and Smartlands are making it happen in the next few weeks. This is a multi-multi-trillion dollar market and there will be huge rewards for first movers and early adopters.  \n\n12) **SME Funding** \\- smaller businesses and startups can find it difficult to get seed funding, or unlock liquidity for expansion. Smartlands is going to be directly engaging with entrepreneurs and business owners to help them grow.  \n\n13) **Flexibility** \\- beyond the two key sectors above that Smartlands are focusing on launch, the platform itself allows all kinds of other ABT transactions - including things like debt trading, DeFi loans, agriculture and other alternative investments. Smartlands are not just focusing on one area, but developing an ABT platform that can onboard new sectors.  \n\n14) **Brand Name** \\- the crypto-sphere is filled with projects with (quite frankly) ridiculous names that won\u2019t be taken seriously in any mainstream or professional business context. Smartlands, on the other hand, has by far one of the best brand names in the space. Recognisable branding is vital to success in a space as fast-moving as crypto. Smartlands does what it says and you remember it for what it does, in any language.  \n\n15) **Ukraine Launch** \\- with solid partnerships in Ukraine (see below), Smartlands are now focused on one of the strongest emerging markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the most crypto-friendly too. Yes, there are obviously risks around political stability and corruption - but check this EU report to see how confident the EU Commission is on these fronts. If one of the world\u2019s largest trading blocs can be this confident, so can we. Remember also that Ukraine is just the beginning\u2026  \n\n16) **CEO is an Early Investor** \\- the current CEO of Smartlands, Ilia Obratzcov, started as an SLT investor involved from the very first days of the original ICO. As a software developer, he eventually applied for and became the Chief Technical Officer involved in development of the platform through a number of iterations - before now being the CEO in charge of the company of a day-to-day basis. Ilia\u2019s faith in Smartlands became a career and he has a vision for it that surpasses many other entrepreneurs looking to catch a quick crypto wave before cashing out. The CEO has been in it for the long term and his success is linked to ours as token holders.  \n\n17) **Built on Stellar** \\- the Stellar protocol is easily one of the best and most efficient blockchain protocols currently available. It also happens to have one of the most professional teams in the crypto space, with high levels of integrity and a focus on regulatory compliance and financial utility. Stellar is the perfect platform for tokenisation of the kind that Smartlands are developing; and they are close partners in what the future holds.  \n\n18) **Marketing Hasn\u2019t Even Started** \\- this is a token that has gone 30x in three months with ZERO marketing. The team is focused on developing a world-leading platform and getting all the right partnerships in place. Compare that to other platforms that are all marketing and not much else. Marketing will begin soon in the lead up to the platform launch - but just consider how successful SLT has been without it. What do you think will happen when they start?  \n\n19) **First Mover Advantage** \\- there are many projects in crypto that offer something revolutionary, but you have to wait two years to find out if it will be a success\u2026 but trust us, right? Smartlands, on the other hand, are launching in the next few weeks (currently April). This is happening RIGHT NOW and they will be at least six months ahead of a lot of other competitors trying to do something similar.  \n\n***Partners***  \n\n20) **Empire State Capital** \\- with the new Chairman of Smartlands, Martin Birch, we have someone who has spent over a decade working within investment banking in Ukraine. Not only that, but he\u2019s been focused on client sales and development of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). This is an important on-ramp for wealthy clients who aren\u2019t looking to invest in crypto itself, necessarily, but are looking for high return investment opportunities.  \n\n21) **Quantum Attorneys** \\- legal frameworks and regulations is one of the most difficult areas for things like real estate and SME tokenisation. Who better to have on board then a law firm advising the Ukraine government on their digital strategy? That\u2019s right, Smartlands has a [legal framework ready to go](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-is-pleased-to-announce-that-the-legal-framework-for-the-alternative-investment-project-is-finalized-and-ready-for-launch/) that is fully compliant with regulations both current and incoming.  \n\n22) **Colliers International** \\- with a game like real estate you need a big hitter on your side. There aren\u2019t many bigger than Colliers, who have been working with Smartlands since 2018 and are continuing to do so with the new platform launch. The partner link on the website now leads to the Ukrainian page for Colliers, so watch this space\u2026  \n\n23) **Agroxy** \\- agriculture is another area ripe for tokenisation that is currently under-explored, and Smartlands are in there [with a new startup](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-and-agroxy-announce-a-strategic-partnership/) that looks to create an efficient marketplace for the transfer of products, equipment and other agricultural goods. This will be one of the first joint ventures in which Smartlands are providing a platform back-bone for another organisation\u2026 and yes, there will be fees involved that go into the revenue sharing for qualifying stakers.  \n\n24) **Big U** \\- the newest partnership announcement is an excellent one, as it opens up [a whole new area for Smartlands](https://smartlands.io/blog/business-incubator-group-ukraine-big-u-and-smartlands/) outside of real estate: SMEs. This partnership is a big deal not only because the Smartlands platform will be embedded in their mentoring and incubation process for new startups in Ukraine, but also because Big U is working directly with the Ukraine government as part of economic initiatives in the region.  \n\n25) **Archax** \\- institutional investors need to know that what they are involved in is trustworthy and well-vetted. Enter Archax, an exchange aimed at institutional investors that is focusing on the ABT market that is launching in the next few months. Smartlands was [one of their earliest partners](https://smartlands.io/blog/smartlands-archax-partner-for-trading-of-smartlands-issued-security-tokens-on-upcoming-archax-exchange/) and will be listed on the exchange when it launches.  \n\n26) **Stellar Foundation** \\- as mentioned previously, the fact that Smartlands are so [closely involved with the Stellar Foundation](https://smartlands.io/blog/a-stellar-performance/) should be seen as a huge positive. Not only because of the expertise and professionalism of Stellar, which is second to none in crypto, but because they are embedded with them in Ukraine. Stellar is working with the Ukrainian government to develop one of the world\u2019s leading CBDCs. Smartlands is right there with them.  \n\n27) **NO Crypto Investment Firms** \\- have you ever looked at a project partner list and wondered: why are all the partners just crypto firms? When you look into it, you realise they are all crypto-focused startup funds that are investing in anything they think will make quick returns. Smartlands does NOT have partnerships with these firms, because they are focused on deeper and more professional connections with the business sectors they are involved in. Crypto investment firms dump their investments on retail holders - not having them as partners is a good thing over the long term.  \n\n***Community***  \n\n28) **Level-Headed Investors** \\- the Smartlands community is currently made up of people who have done their due diligence and understand that this is an opportunity based on fundamentals. The community is one of the most mature and welcoming in crypto.  \n\n29) **Real Accounts** \\- the numbers you see in our community (Telegram and Reddit primarily) are \\*real people\\*, using real accounts. There aren\u2019t thousands of bots just to boost numbers, what you see is a real community excited to be in this together.  \n\n30) **Community Website** \\- the community is active and dedicated, enough to [create our own website](https://www.smartlandscommunity.com/) with FAQs and How To guides; as well as insight articles that go into more detail on the Tokenomics and History of Smartlands over the years. This website is not run or created by the company, it is 100% community owned and operated..  \n\n31) **Top 50 NOT Selling** \\- one key indicator for the strength of a project is whether the largest holders are selling or not. Particularly after the 30x gains that Smartlands has seen in the past three months, you would expect a lot of top holders are cashing out. However, there are currently less than 5 accounts in the Top 50 holders that are selling any of their long-held SLT. We know this because the SDEX is 100% transparent - every trade can be analysed and examined\u2026 and it shows that the big holders are NOT selling.  \n\n32) **Meme Magic** \\- the meme game in the Smartlands community is strong and we have fun doing it. Not only do we have people interested in the technical side, but the creatives are on board too. Meme magic works and we have it!   \n\n*Note: $320 is not a meme.*  \n\nThis article was written by u/320prophecy and all credit goes to him.",

            "text": "In my circles, almost everybody is saying that crypto world is, at best, a big bubble, and it would burst soon. At worst, it is the biggest Ponzi scheme ever created in the history of humanity. Every cryptocurrency has only one aim: To fool millions of people all over the world and take their money. I don't try to convince them, don't even start any discussions. I just smile and change the subject. Why? Because all these things look like deja vu for me.    \n\nI am in my mid-forties and worked as a developer for several companies, including those that are well known today. I also owned some shares of blue-chip tech companies. Everyone around me, including those who claimed to be experts, told me that the Internet was just a bubble, nothing more. And then dot-com bubble burst.  I made a decision to stop holding the stocks and sold them. Now it is impossible to assess how much money I would have gained in case I had not listened to those experts and continued holding the stocks... After many years I ended up in the same situation. And now, since I have become a more experienced individual, I am not going to listen to the advice of fools trying so hard to look knowledgeable. I am not going to repeat my mistakes. \n\nI started trading about two years ago. I bought several cryptocurrencies and kept holding them despite market fluctuations which sometimes were tough. Of course, I modified my portfolio, disposing of garbage and buying promising cryptos. All of my surroundings were desperately screaming that I would lose my money and I had to cease to play Russian roulette. Bubble, bubble. bubble... Bubble, bubble, bubble... While trying to convince me, my friends and colleagues became obsessed with this word. Mass media started spreading the rumors about regulation, institutional investors, especially greedy bankers from Wall Street who are guilty of 2008 financial crisis, threw balls to the wall so that cryptos became less popular. \n\nAnd I still continued to hold. The entire world tried to convince me to sell, and I still continued to hold. And now I can say that it was a successful strategy. I bought several major cryptos like Ether, Ripple, Iota, Litecoin and some unpopular and emerging tokens like Xaurum, Primas, and Ties. I used the experience I received during the dot-com boom, and it helped me to be patient. I cannot say that I became wealthy enough to hit the Forbes rating, but I gained pretty much money. \n\nWhile other investments are becoming less and less profitable, crypto became the only sphere where you can gain a lot of money. It is time to pre-empt our seats before others have understood where the pot of gold is hidden. Blockchain is the technology that is already revolutionizing the world. And it is just the beginning. I have no doubts that this industry will show significant growth. I have no intention to test my nerves and don't want to trade. I am going to be in it very long time. And I will be successful. No, not just me. We will be successful.\n",

What would you have, in the end ? Now I am sure you didn't ever own any of those stocks, I know I didn't, but, as the hypesters like to say, crypto is still early, like 1995 internet, but that also means we may still be looking at big crypto coins that turn out to be a bunch of Myspaces, Lycos, and Alta Vistas, all of which looked very promising during the start of dot.com, especially Myspace, which turned down some huge buyout offers, in it's day. On the plus side, its unlikely any major coins will ever go to zero, just because they are NOT actual businesses, and don't need to make payroll. In fact, I am sure most cryptos could survive the bankruptcy of their creator companies, since they are (mostly) maintained by their communities. \n\nLooking out long term, does it make sense that thousands of different internet coins will go to the moon, or even beat the stock market returns, just by doing nothing but having some cold wallets ? I mean, wouldn't the use case depend on some actual USE ? Some of these coins have pre-mines in the BILLIONS of coins (Ripple, one of your hodlings, even ), and many of them are given to the founders in vast quantities (also Ripple, but pretty much everything that didn't start as a jokecoin, but seriously, 60% of all Ripple coin to the creators is kinda huge, by any standard). Clearly, Bitcoin itself is something special, and will probably hold most of its huge value, but almost everything else lacks the mystery and history of Bitcoin, and newer coins now coming out just transact better and faster and cheaper. And, in the end, this could be something governments get into, either because they are pariah states (Venezuela), or just because they screw the pooch on fiat, and need to start over (also Venezuela, but every fiat more than a few hundred years old has gone to zero, so its likely to happen again in many countries) Do you think that your chosen coins will be THE ONES ? It seems like fiat has huge 'network effect', IE, when everyone uses something, the incentive is for everyone else to use it as well, since you know you can always trade it, and everyone else takes it. It seems to me, with .01 % penetration, crypto has not chosen a 'winner coin', besides in terms of pure increases in value, and crypto's Facebook may not even exist yet !\n",

At the time, I went to Best Buy looked around and saw the new Mac and Apple had just released OSX. All the old timer Mac people hated the new OS and for most of the core popular programs you had to run them on a virtual machine of OS 9, it was very clunky. On the other hand with me having a UNIX background I found it amazing that it ran a variant of BSD with a wonderful GUI top of it. Plus if you found a program that was written for OS X... it ran like butter. \n\nNow remember... this was before the iPod or the iPhone. Apple had nothing but various computers and a few pieces of software that ran on them. All my friends told me that Apple was going to go out of business soon. The market agreed. Apple was about three dollars a share and I was sitting on a substantial amount of money at the time that was doing nothing. I actually believed in the product, I loved using it, and thought, \u201cthis company is going somewhere soon\u201d. So even though my gut told me to spend the money. I didn\u2019t. I listened my friends and to the FUD and bought other \u201csafe\u201d stocks. As Apple kept increasing in market share and delivering more products I always felt like it was overpriced. I always waited... do I buy now? Do I buy now? Had do I committed to my instincts at the time, I wouldn\u2019t be working right now. I\u2019m not going to make that mistake again.",

If you already own some digital assets and want to earn interest, then you can resort to the relevant popular platforms I have highlighted below, and earn passive income from your cryptocurrencies without engaging in trading.\n\n**BlockFi**\n\nBlockFi is a centralized fintech platform that offers crypto loans and interest accounts to owners of crypto assets. It also provides trading and wealth management solutions to individuals as well as companies.\n\nWith BlockFi, one can earn interest of up to 8.6% per year on cryptocurrencies.\u00a0\n\nPros:\n\n\\- Well-established cryptocurrency lending platform with a large number of users and AUM;\n\n\\- Lightweight and easy-to-use, centralized application;\n\n\\- A reward program giving the ability to use its own credit card.\n\nCons:\n\n\\- Limited list of assets;\n\n\\- Only 1 free withdrawal for cryptocurrency and 1 free withdrawal for stablecoins per month;\n\n\\- Monthly payments instead of weekly.\n\n**Nexo**\n\nLike BlockFi, Nexo is among the crypto lending pioneers that offer reliable loan services. The platform allows users to borrow a minimum of $10, which comes with an interest rate starting from 5.9 percent. Currently, loan collateralization can only be done against 16 cryptocurrencies.\u00a0\n\nPros:\n\n\\- Gives the ability to make an extra 25% when earning Nexo tokens;\n\n\\- No withdrawal, transaction, or platform fees;\n\n\\- Established platform with over $ 4 billion in processing and over 1 million customers.\n\nCons:\n\n\\- The best interest rates require owning Nexo tokens;\n\n\\- The $100 million insurance covers only assets held in cold storage;\n\n\\- When it comes to borrowing, the percentages are a little higher compared with competitors.\n\n**Midas.Investments**\n\n[Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/) is a crypto-investment platform and exchange that offers investors the opportunity to invest in a fully managed and automated investment portfolio offering long-term growth potential, as well as weekly payouts.

The mobile crypto lending app allows users to lend cryptocurrencies while earning between 5% and 21.49% APY.\u00a0\n\nPros:\n\n\\- No minimum investment amounts;\n\n\\- Weekly interest payments;\n\n\\- Secured by overcollateralized assets.\n\nCons:\n\n\\- Rates change every week;\n\n\\- No support service;\n\n\\- No crypto-loans for U.S. citizens.\n\n**Coinloan**\n\nCoinloan is kind of a P2P marketplace for lenders and borrowers. Users can set their terms and interest rates on it and the system matches the appropriate counteroffers automatically.\n\nPros:\n\n\\- No withdrawal fees;\n\n\\- Increased rates for CLT holders;\n\n\\- Crypto & fiat exchange.\n\nCons:\n\n\\- Volatility can affect loans;\n\n\\- Limited amount for investment;\n\n\\- No statistics and financial data.\n\nThere are other platforms on the market for earning passive income on cryptocurrencies. I just indicated the proven ones that enjoy a certain degree of popularity and have a user base. I am currently trying out other platforms that I will also mention when I have a solid opinion and review. By the way, have you tried any of these? What other platforms would you like me to review?",

Just type in the contract address at the top. They can be found [here](charts.bogged.finance). It\u2019s a really user-friendly and intuitive UI. \n\nAt a little under a month old this is a very undervalued project, with its sights set on becoming a huge player on the BSC chain.  \n\nIf you\u2019re keen then check out the links above. There\u2019s a lot more on their social media, particularly the ones beginning with D and T, but I can\u2019t post direct links here due to the sub rules. Check my post history and you\u2019ll find one with social links. \n\nThere\u2019s some great staking initiatives currently, 4% of all transactions of $BOG are entirely redistributed to stakers. \n\nWith limit orders releasing today and marketing happening over the next few days I can see a lot of potential for some excellent gains, as well as pretty revolutionary tech. \n\nMake sure to check out their other oracles, including a really great looking RNG!\n\nI recently did a post on r/cryptocurrency about their ARG and giveaway for those who love crypto, puzzles and going down the rabbit hole! \n\nThis project is the one to watch this year in so many ways.",

Many of you asked if they have been backtested and how that would work.\n\nSo I created this quick tool to help you assess the profitablity of your trading strategy of trading bot if you're using one.\n\nBacktesting is a way of feeding your current trading strategy to a script that applies it on historical data, in order to determine how successful it could be in the future.\n\nPast performance does not always guarantee future returns, but it's good practice to test your strategy (or trading algorithm) before you go ham.\n\nThe script downloads historical data for a coin of your choice, and at an interval of your choosing. This is then used by the script to determine how profitable a strategy can be, and whether it has the potential to beat a buy and hold.\n\nAt the end of the testing phase, the tool will generate a plot showing each trade and final balance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s5e2jn86sv571.jpg?width=3604&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6452a135fa3d90915c9382c9c5edff2b90964224\n\nWorking with historical data since the start of this year, I fed it a simple strategy - buy if the price is up 1% in the last minute. Sell at 10% gain or 5% loss - but you can customise these parameters yourself. This strategy made a marginal loss on ICPUSDT, but then this is probably not the best coin to test on since it's been in decline ever since it was listed on Binance.\n\nHere's the same strategy on NANOUSDT, seems like we're $800 in profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c3476577sv571.jpg?width=3618&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cb9e6a74c03302b32d9facfe1e6e11acbae5048\n\nHappy Testing!\n\nHere's the guide on how to implement it:\n\n[https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/05/16/trailing-stop-loss-and-more-improvements-added-to-the-binance-volatility-trading-bot/](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/05/16/trailing-stop-loss-and-more-improvements-added-to-the-binance-volatility-trading-bot/)\n\nAnd here's the repo if you're a python wizard:\n\n[https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/backtesting-for-cryptocurrency-trading](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/backtesting-for-cryptocurrency-trading)",

If you are new to crypto and blindly jumping in to a new project, make sure you understand the basics before you get burned.\n\n**DOGE** has an infinite supply. It was created as a joke.\n\n**BTC** has a max supply of 21,000,000.  It was created and used to transfer value in the digital world. It may have been *treated like a joke* by the masses at first, but it certainly did not begin as one. When people try to use the past of Bitcoin as a way to measure the future success of Doge, they are wrong to do so because the max supply does not allow for it. Supply and demand. \n\nI recommend learning about the **tokenomics** of cryptocurrencies before investing because it may do you some good in future trading endeavors.\n\nI don't want to tell you what to put your money into. You need to do what makes you feel comfortable with your investment. After you learn about the tokenomics of coins, you may think twice about buying certain ones in the middle of a spike.\n\nIf you don't care and just want to try to ride the momentum, go for it! I completely understand the idea of getting into DOGE from a standpoint of it being your duty to stick it to the system, but it will not affect anyone in doing so but your fellow investors that are diving in to DOGE along side of you. \n\nWe all have our way of trading, but taking a little bit of time to learn about the tokenomics of coins can save your account some losses in the future. There are plenty of promising projects out there!  Find one you believe in and dive in!\n\nGood luck to all of you!",

I did not know a thing about crypto and only knew of bitcoin having high value. Held it for about a week and sold it cause needed the money back and had no clue what I was doing. I am back here again because of the DOGE fiasco. Luckily i didn't lose out much which was only a $50. I could have doubled what i put in at a point, but i ate into the hype.\n\nThis brought me back into crypto and with this time i've begun researching more, learning the terminology, and picking up how to read the charts and what it means to hold a coin that has potential. Over this weekend I could not help but reading about crypto and doing research. Seeing the memes of being in bed on the phone is what I was doing at this point.\n\nI'm slowly creeping money into crypto and diversifying on different coins (XLM, ETH, ALGO, LINK) I have this urge to learn and earn more having not had much financially in life so far. Seeing what is going on with crypto and the potential makes me feel i can finally get some sort of savings account in order with good returns. Thank you DOGE for getting me into this community.\n\nTLDR; Happy to be here and looking for advice \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c",

Nano is a currency, like: Bitcoin, Monero, IOTA, Dash, LTC and others.  These currencies are a SoV and a medium of exchange.  They are to serve no other purpose.\n\nIn the world of tomorrow, we move value around for various purposes.  Some of it programmed, some more manual, but many reasons to move money.  In that world, being the most efficient at what it does, is highly likely to have a strong purpose.  Bitcoin may maintain its leading status in terms of market cap.  It may just be avoided for many reasons as it\u2019s cost prohibitive.  Monero will be used \u201cout of the system\u201d most likely as well.  There will be 2 systems, \u201cin the system\u201d transactions and \u201cout of the system\u201d transactions.  Satoshi was aiming for the latter.  The vision isn\u2019t within another centralized system.\n\nNano scales on the first layer.  That\u2019s huge.\n\nI also believe people will choose a SoV that aligns with their views of control, security, etc.  I like that the security of Nano is based on your Nano Representaive  delegated vote.  I don\u2019t like the centralization of mining and the control miners have over the direction of the network.  So, in many people\u2019s eyes, it\u2019s much better as a SoV, long term.

Someone decided to mention nano. An issue with lightning network? Someone commenting about how nano is better anyway. \n\nIt\u2019s insufferable. Nano is a fine project, but it isn\u2019t the only good project. If the more annoying members of the community weren\u2019t so pushy, people wouldn\u2019t hate it so much.

            "text": "Today, a document sourced from a Greystone Capital appeared in a Korean community telegram. It appears that they\u2019re heavy into cryptocurrencies and bitcoin already, while doing a deep research of the high potential small cap alternative cryptocurrencies. Document is written in Korean (I\u2019m Korean), and it reveals that Greystone Capital has performed a deep research of PIVX and is closely following every single step they do. According to their analysis, PIVX as a former top 10 cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped way below its realistic value, particularly when there\u2019s a fear in altcoin markets. They appear to have a very optimistic view for generating returns from PIVX, and if they haven\u2019t already positioned themselves into PIVX, Greystone might end up holding a large percentage of total PIVX supply in circulation, becoming their largest stakeholder. They\u2019re bullish on this well established and proven proof of stake consensus blockchain, with opt-in privacy solution. Furthermore, the document mentions that PIVX will be in a major TV show in America airing on Amazon, Google Play and other big platforms, which even makes it possible that Greystone paid for such a huge and probably very expensive promotion.\n\nSome crypto Twitter influencers tweeted about it already: [LINK TO TWEET](https://twitter.com/osungade2/status/1325462136739520513?s=20)",

When it releases, you will see it shows the old website, and is missing current announcements like the v5.0 wallet and the return of Privacy via zkSNARKS Sapling etc. It even has John M being interviewed in it, and he moved to Cardano quite a while ago. So, if you think the video was made for the Greystone to profit from, you would assume they would do a better job of it. ;)  \n\n\nHaving said that, conspiracies do get people talking and that is a good thing. More prudent approach though is to dig into GitHub and see for your self the massive amount of work the Core Developers have done - and for how long they have been keeping the pace.",

            "text": "Cryptocurrency trading has always been a risky process due to volatility. What is more important, trading is becoming less profitable since governments and institutional investors remain skeptical about cryptocurrencies. Rates of major cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly dependent on governments of countries such like South Korea or China. They can crash rates just talking about their plans for cryptocurrencies trading regulations. It's time to remember projects that not just offer their tokens but also provide useful services and show other ways of blockchain application. I would be interested in your opinion about these platforms.\n\n[Enigma.](https://www.enigma.co/) Founded by MIT graduates and researchers, Enigma is an ambitious project aiming to solve two critically important problems of blockchain. Firstly, Enigma promises to ensure privacy by means of the new type of Smart Contracts that is called Secret Contracts and based on unique technology Enigma develops. Secondly, Enigma uses several approaches to solve the problem of scalability and thus realize great potential blockchain has.\n\n[SALT](https://www.saltlending.com/) is the platform that allows to get loans using blockchain assets as a collateral. Keep your crypto - get your cash, that's the company motto. With simplified application process, fast approval and no prepayment fees, SALT offers a convenient service that many crypto traders definitely need.\n\n[Storm Market](https://stormtoken.com/) is designed to enable people all around the world to earn money by utilizing technology. Using its gamified micro-task platform for STORM tokens, the project makes it accessible for members to find and use new ways to earn and engage from anywhere, at any time, from any device.\n\n[Ties.Network](http://tiesdb.com/) is a decentralized social platform created for business professionals and IT specialists. On the network, they can connect with each other and strike business deals by means of smart contracts in no time. Ties.Network is based on a trustworthy rating system and makes sure all participants can focus entirely on business and benefits of beneficial relationships.\n\n[Zcash.](https://z.cash/) Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies show your full transactions history to the public. Zcash is considered as the first open and permissionless cryptocurrency that can reliably protect the privacy of transactions using zero-knowledge cryptography. Zcash still remains underestimated, especially in comparison with Monero.\n",

Unfortunately, with any major boom and FOMO cycle comes those who wish to profiteer off of people trying to get into/learn about crypto.

There are many reputable sources available on our sidebar and wiki to get you started on your path. Be very weary of anybody who messages you on here, as scammers comb reddit for those they wish to exploit with social engineering tactics.\n\nChanges:\nMinimum comment/post karma= 420\nMinimum age requirement= 69 days\n\nNice...\n\nWhy These Changes?\n\n99% of these posts come from accounts that are brand new or have little to no karma or account age.\n\nWhat if I'm just a reddit and crypto noob who wants to post?\n\nIf you are a reddit noob who does not meet these requirements and wishes to post legit content/questions, please display a VERIFIED EMAIL ADDRESS award on your account before messaging the mods to request to post. We will make you an approved submitter once we confirm you do not intend to market/shill.\n\nReminder: This is a sub that is intended to be fun and educational and free from censorship and agendas.

Don't post about an ICO (r/cryptoico, r/icocrypto), IEO, IDO etc. Don't market or promote (shill) a coin, exchange, or other service here, go to r/CryptoOffers instead. Don't talk about what is pumping to 100X, or some new coin that has the words Elon, Musk, Tesla, or Moon in it, that should probably be discussed in r/cryptomoonshots.\n\nWe continue to work towards improving the sub for you all, and continue to ask for your help in flagging low quality content.\n\nThanks everyone for being a part of the sub and helping to keep it a great community here on Reddit.\n\nCheers,\n\n-The Cryptocurrencies Mod Team\n\nEdit: Grammar",

However, many ICOs are funded well enough to just purchase accounts, or use dark net markets to purchase such services. I haven\u2019t seen such a listing, but I\u2019m sure they exist.

Everyone would agree that communities are there for the mutual benefit of individuals. However, when it comes to **investing**, many people decide to go the route of the \u201clone wolf\u201d. Those people would argue that it is important to \u201cgo against the flow\u201d or \u201cbuy when everyone is selling\u201d. Well, is this really the case, or did they just pick up some phrases without actually questioning them?\n\n**The Risks When Investing Alone**\n\nGoing about investing completely by yourself might be a brave idea, unquestioned. But is it really the smartest path to take? Especially when you\u2019re starting off, it can feel as if you\u2019re being thrown headfirst into a pit of snakes and you gotta figure out which ones are poisonous and which ones are harmless. There are thousands of companies with thousands of different business models. Investing with a lack of knowledge about which shares can yield profits can quickly turn into a lack of funds to pay your bills.\n\nNow, let\u2019s say you don\u2019t trust the heavily regulated stock market anymore (think GameStop), large corporations have become too powerful, and you\u2019d rather put your money into a different kind of investment. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re fascinated by **blockchain technology** and so you decide to invest in **cryptocurrency** instead. Having ruled out some of the more traditional risks, cryptocurrency investments bring their very own set of new ones.\n\nFirst, with market capitalisations sometimes very low, volatility can be extremely high. This makes coins very susceptible to pump-and-dump schemes. Because the cryptocurrency market is not yet quite as regulated as other markets, you can also end up investing in plain scams (not to say this can\u2019t happen in the stock market, *\\*cough\\** Wirecard *\\*cough\\**). Second, not all cryptocurrencies are designed as security or utility tokens. There are platform tokens, governance tokens, and transactional tokens too - all of which serve an important purpose in the crypto world. You cannot expect to throw all your money into Bitcoin and immediately yield large profits. Crypto investing is shrouded in a fog of uncertainty that only few can lift. As someone who is just starting off solo, how are you gonna separate the wheat from the chaff?\n\n**How Communities Can Help You Yield Profits When Investing In Crypto**\n\nGoing with the flow doesn\u2019t seem all too bad when you\u2019ve got a strong community supporting you. Let's go through some of the things that **trading communities** can actually help you with. Most obviously, a group\u2019s combined knowledge and expertise can keep you safe. Safe from scams, safe from bad investments, safe from losing money. Even better, the insight and support you get will help you find those rare gems that do have potential to yield large profits. Where can you find such communities, you ask?\n\nThere are many platforms and forums that many small trading communities call home. They are providing helpful information on different coins, the ability for newbies to consult advanced traders about their portfolio, and even the possibility of **group investments** where people use their combined buying power to pump a coin to make a profit.\n\nOne example of a group that does it right is WhaleSpring\\*.\\* Just like many other platforms, it enables you to reap the benefits of community-based investing. But unlike those that operate according to a pump-and-dump concept, WhaleSpring\u2019s focus is to localize the most promising crypto projects and support them long-term. Instead of **pump-and-dump**, WhaleSpring only does **invest-and-hold**. Traders just starting off don\u2019t have to worry about reacting too late and losing their profits to the \u201cdump\u201d. This happens easily in other groups where many members use bots with automatic buying and selling algorithms. WhaleSpring got rid of those entirely by only announcing tokens as images (which bots can\u2019t read). Their community is about real, honest, and long-term investment into projects that can stand the test of time (a value-for-value model).\n\nNow, if you are reading this because you are about to jump into the world of investing, maybe you want to give trading groups like WhaleSpring a try. Of course, you can also go the solo route but, as the philosopher Howard Zinn once said: \n\n*\u201cSmall acts, when multiplied by millions of people, can transform the world.\u201d*",

FBAR requirements state that anyone having any funds over 10,000 in any overseas institution (exchanges) has to file a Fincen 114 form. The penalties for not doing so range from $10,000 PER instance (each exchange, each year) to the greater of $100,000 or 50% of the balance in an unreported foreign account. If someone wasn't compliant in previous years and comes forward, there are ways to mitigate those fines. Checking if they are foreign or not is usually available on the exchanges site on where they are located. Decentralized exchanges are in a grey area, chances are that they are not part of this requirement if you are in the US when working with them however it may be better to just file the form. We file it for all of our clients to make sure they stay in compliance if they have anything in an overseas exchange.",

Cointracking.info (better for more high frequency traders or those that have many exchanges) and bitcoin.tax (better for those with less exchanges and trades). We provide a free year of those tools to anyone that hires us. To note, the data imports from the many exchanges often have issues and need to be manually reconciled. Also, when you are moving crypto from one of your own wallets or changes to another of your own wallets or exchanges, the reporting counts it as a sale and it has to be manually reconciled in order to have the data be accurate.  Our team of bookkeepers, accountants and CPAs handles that for our clients and it can be quite annoying.",

You are taxed when you buy, mine, trade, or move your crypto holdings?\n\nMy main question is something you might be able to answer. For example: If I move crypto from one of my wallets to another one of my wallets I am taxed on this as a sale? What legal authority does the US have to tax that action or classify it as a sale? No value or net gains changed its just in a different wallet. Wouldn\u2019t that be the same as moving my cash from my wallet to me safe or money between accounts? So theoretically I could be taxed the entire value of my crypto holdings just for moving it back and forth between wallets?\n\nI was thinking of getting into crypto, but if the US thinks it has a right to tax every aspect of crypto currencies maybe I wont.",

I'm happy to see some discussion come through even though my thread got removed from /r/Monero. I'm just going to address a few points I've been getting on pms/etc:\n\n- No I did not include Verge or BTCP in this debate. You can bring up points, no one's stopping you, but if you want a debate centered around them then set one up\n\n- I couldn't make this post on /r/Cryptocurrency because it violates their rules (it's stupid but true)\n\n- I kind of messed up the announcements for this debate but I'll try to do better next time :) Keep going without me (I abstained anyways :P) but I'll look into making another in the future if you all like it",

Ledger wallets have max. 10kB RAM and Trezor is similar. This is why it\u2019s going to be impossible to deprecate t-addresses and thus impossible for Zcash to achieve full privacy.",

Most exchanges and wallets, especially multiplatform wallets, don't care about supporting z-addresses. So even if z-addresses are relatively accessible and able to be used on desktop and mobile, it's not necessarily enough to get people to use z-addresses. Typically, you need to make something mandatory to force people to use a feature, and this isn't possible if many network participants (eg: hardware wallets) can't upgrade.\n\nThe impact of t-addresses are large. <10% of transactions touch a z-address at all, and <0.5% have z-addresses on both sides of the transaction. Hopefully sapling increases this, but it really needs to be a much higher number, ideally 100%.",

            "text": "Demex (Decentralized Mercantile Exchange) on Switcheo TradeHub will be the first L2 cross-chain DEX with 150x derivatives! March 1st is a new beginning!\n\nHere's a little background to help you understand the design and disruptive potential of Demex Exchange on Switcheo TradeHub (SWTH):\n\nSwitcheo TradeHub is a custom, cross-chain, Layer-2 blockchain solution. It was built with the Cosmos SDK utilizing a Tendermint core. Demex Exchange is a fully decentralized trading platform that supports any cryptocurrency derivative product that interfaces with the Switcheo TradeHub blockchain, one of a future many dapps that will run on Switcheo TradeHub. For example, Zilswap will soon be joining the Switcheo TradeHub ecosystem. SWTH is the token at the core of both Switcheo TradeHub and Demex Exchange.\n\nThe Switcheo TradeHub project is a little different than others because the Switcheo Labs team created both Switcheo TradeHub and Demex. They have also been hired by Zilliqa to build the upcoming Zilswap. What does this mean? For one, there is only 1 token (SWTH) for staking and rewards across an entire decentralized, cross-chain ecosystem that is already live - Switcheo TradeHub. This design results in greater utility and increased rewards for stakers. Staking SWTH results in rewards being paid for not only all blockchain transactions across the ecosystem, this includes non-Demex apps, but also Demex trading fees.\n\nThe majority of blockchain projects have 1 token per component (blockchain or dapp), and dapps running on blockchains have separate, individual tokens distinct from the blockchain token. Take the older, soon to be sunset Switcheo Exchange. It was a dapp running on NEO, so there were 2 separate tokens - SWTH and NEO. This is not the case with Demex on Switcheo TradeHub. SWTH is core for both, so there is increased utility and staking rewards potential.\n\nThe end result is that we now have a decentralized, custom, cross-chain Layer-2 blockchain solution specifically designed for trading with the SWTH token as a core component of the entire Switcheo TradeHub ecosystem - both Demex and non-Demex apps, so Switcheo TradeHub transactions involving non-Demex dapps as well as Demex trading transactions will all be utilizing SWTH to pay for blockchain transactions. The practical result of this is a doubling of the utility for SWTH. Additionally, 90% of all blockchain transaction fees as well as Demex Exchange trading fees are paid out to stakers of SWTH (remaining 10% allocated to a software development fund for ecosystem development and expansion). The end result is a truly decentralized DEX. SWTH stakers are the owners and will be rewarded with their share of all generated fees based upon their amount of SWTH staked. Rewards for Demex trading fees will be paid in the form of the traded pairs, but the amount of rewards will be determined by the amount of SWTH staked. This is HUGE! Currently stakers are earning 55%+ apr.\n\nHere are some simple numbers: At current apr, 100,000 SWTH (\\~$3,700 today) will earn approximately 150 SWTH/day, so you can do some simple math based upon price of SWTH for daily, passive income. SWTH is currently .037 as of this writing.\n\nMost crypto projects started off with token ICO's, but in far too many cases, the tokens were utilized more for funding than for the actual project itself. This resulted in projects - those that actually produced something - being faced with the issue of their token's utility, and teams found themselves scrambling to develop a usecase and value proposition in order to support token value. If not done successfully, a project, in hindsight, can appear to be just another software project with a token slapped on it for \"crypto\" hype and fundraising with little to no real use case or value for the project's token.\n\nSwitcheo TradeHub has been designed from the start with the SWTH token as a key, core component. This is extremely important when evaluating projects for investment, and is a major reason why Switcheo TradeHub will have a successful, truly decentralized exchange. Stakers are the owners/voters who receive the project's generated revenue and direct the project via governance voting. Do yourself a favor and do some due diligence.\n\nMarch 1 will be a noteworthy date in the development history of Defi. Demex on Swithcheo TradeHub will be the first L2 cross-chain DEX with 150x derivatives!  The Switcheo Labs team has been working round the clock on delivering something real, and now is the time for it to be unveiled!",

How would I be able to identify which one is reasonable and which one is a scam?\n\nAnd just one more point, haven't some cryptos like doge etc. exploded and made some traders good money even when they did not have much fundamental value?

Similar to the analysis you do on stocks.\n\nIf it isn't better to trade the already top marketcap cryptos is your choice. You play safer, but will probably make less profit if your right and lose less if you're wrong. Simple risk / reward.\n\n2 - Experience and looking for red flags and missing stuff. Like, maybe it seems it's an amazing project but you realise their team is anonymous... Uh oh, red flag. Or there's a single account with 20% of all the coins... Uh... No... Pass. Search YouTube videos about how to discern them, I recommend you Coin Bureau.\n\n3 - That's not an investment a fundamental analysis investor would take, no. People that won money on DOGE were either lucky or they trade with other analysis than fundamentals. Because DOGE is a no no by a fundamental perspective.\n\nMy investment style is based on fundamentals and technical analysis. DOGE is pump chasing and social trends analysis, I don't do that, but you may, it's just another strategy.",

This occurred days before El Salvador formally adopted Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nPrice Watch: As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies suffered big declines Tuesday that coincided with El Salvador\u2019s adoption, investors took notice of Algorand. The price of Alogrand was up 40% between Tuesday and Wednesday. In the past month, the price of Algorand has more than doubled.\n\nInteresting: Algorand holds the distinction of being the first pure proof of stage blockchain to be publicly available.\n\nFinal Thoughts: For investors searching for the next big crypto, Alogrand holds some promise. However, it\u2019s still a young blockchain.\n\nHope you enjoyed this commentary.

To practice a good customer or community care and relationship, a project must first have an up and working Support or Customer Service which is always available to respond when the Support Button is pressed.\n\nDIVI is among the very few cryptocurrency projects with powerful and down to earth Support Service. This has been made possible because DIVI cares much about the Safety and Security of its community members. In view of this, DIVI has gone an extra mile to upgrade the already Support Service into the DIVI Crypto Concierge Program.\n\nThe DIVI Crypto Concierge Program intends to make the accessibility of DIVI Support very simple and easy to use even with the amateurs or newbies who intend to receive lessons from the scratch. The Support integrates live chat, mail, telegram support, and many more. \n\nDon't hesitate to contact the DIVI Support for any assistance. With DIVI, Crypto is made easy.

For now, the Cloudwith.me tokens are on-sale at the company\u2019s website at a rate of $10 per token. That means that anyone interested can purchase CLD and obtain the cryptocurrency that is changing the cloud market decentralising the market.\n\nTo expand their reach of the Cloudwith.me Tokens, the company has an on-release promotion, and it is currently offering its services for half its pricing. That means that whoever buys tokens with a credit card will get a 50% discount on Cloudwith.me. These actions seem to be paying off as it has increased CLD popularity, reach, and liquidity.\nThe Clock Is Ticking\n\nThe Cloudwith.me team will keep the promotion going until September 21, 2017. Until then, anyone can get CloudWithMe tokens from its website and also be able to set AWS or Azure services, which will allow any user start benefiting from one of the best ICO that have been created in recent memory.\n\nThat means that for now, you can get a 50% discount for your CLD Tokens. You will also be able to configure your cloud server in a much simpler and faster way than ever before. That, in turn, allows you to start working with cloud services quickly and conveniently, even if you have no experience in cloud computing or cloud storage.\n\nGood News Everyone!\nThere is still time to get into Cloudwith.me fantastic promotion. The faster you join, the sooner you can start profiting from working on a new developing and quickly growing field. And by acquiring CLD tokens, now you can be ahead of the curve because the coin is expected to increase in value as soon as it hits the exchanges. \n\nBut this is only the start of cloud tokens. After September 21st of the current year, the push for decentralisation will increase as the coin becomes openly tradable. That means that anyone who got them ahead of time will have the opportunity of pioneering the spread of a system that is bound to change everything we thought about cloud storage.\n\nIt is Now Or Never\nThis is not just a great investment, but it's also a comfortable one. Tokens are only 10$ each and all you need to for now is go to Cloudwith.me website and use your credit car to buy tokens. In return, you will get access to the fastest growing coin, and the best cloud storage system available.\n\nIt is now or never. You can start using the tokens for setting up your cloud server for half of the future price. That will let you be set and ready for when the altcoin hits the open market by September 21, 2017. Getting in between now and then means that you are bound to win back your initial investment and capitalised on the rising price. \n\nCloudwith.me is offering a coin that will ease the struggles and cost of cloud servers, and also the chance (again, at a 50% discount) to set yourself up for the latest revolution in cloud computing. So do not waste more time reading this article. CLD is a sleeping giant, and it is better to get in now than to regret never doing it later.\n\n[More Info](https://pastebin.com/JB54kmP4)\n",

Microstocks / stock tokens is an example, helping people buy stocks cross country and use any amount of money. \nTokenisation of everything can create a multi-faced economy where there are no hidden costs (like privacy and data) and everything will be a traded good, which is the hardcore decentralisation.\nFor example, let's say that you pay for service A.\nService A is provided by company X, which makes up a nice package of product, reach, advertisement, customer support, social policy, donation etc.\nYou pay for service A but in fact you pay for everything in the package. Any competitor must offer more in the same price in order to compete, which creates barriers of entry to the market and it reinforces monopoly (of company X in this example).\nWith crypto, you don't have service A in one package: you have the native token of product, native token of reach, native token of customer support etc etc.\nNow you get an idea why crypto I confusing but importan: by re-distributing economic incentives in a decentralised fashion it actually weakens monopolies, creates new jobs, and makes up for fair capitalism, an economic wet dream",

I wondered how the top 10 coins fared this week compared to a simple BTC benchmark and came up with the below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome biases to be aware of:\n\n\\- Sentiment analysis can't really pick up sarcasm or memes\n\n\\- I picked only those comments and posts with above 10 upvotes to cut out some of the bot trash and comments that people might not agree with\n\n\\- Like the other post, I ensured isolated mentions of the ticker or full crypto name (e.g. 'BTC' or 'bitcoin'), with punctation or spaces before and after each time it's mentioned\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEstimated Total Comments Parsed Last 7 Day(s): 100k-ish (the text file I store my data in ended up being 25mb -- it\u2019s nothing crazy but it\u2019s quite large for just text). My trading strategy was an equal-weighted portfolio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**Coin**|**Comments/Posts (roughly)**|**Sentiment Score**\\*|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|BTC (surprise!)|9,010|1,320|\n|BAT|1,060|1.,300|\n|ETH|4,660|990|\n|LINK|1,940|900|\n|IOTA|2,090|850|\n|SC|2,080|760|\n|BCH|910|710|\n|DOGE|10,400|400|\n|ERG|850|160|\n|ALGO|520|150|\n\n\\*Sentiment Score is based on sentiment of each comment, its upvotes, and the number of mentions of the coin ticker. That's why DOGE is a lower score despite a massive number of mentions\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince last Monday, BTC is down 22% -- this \"ETF\" is down about 25%. Not much to ascertain here. Is this kind of analysis useful/interesting? Right now, I did something quick/rudimentary (equal-weighted, quick sentiment formula, still took a couple of hours though lol) but if there's more interest I'll work on optimizing and further backtesting.",

I have a nice portfolio I think now, and I like to check it every day and every hour and it has done so much for my mental health just to have something to distract me like this. \n\nIt takes my mind off things, and I now find myself daydreaming about an actual future, and becoming a crypto millionaire now even, and it feels fantastic. Now, I know this will probably not happen ever, but the thing is, I never saw anything resembling a future before this and now I have something to \"live\" for and look forward to and a hope of something fun happening that I enjoy. It feels exciting and like I am a part of something now. \n\nAnd, sorry if I am getting too personal here, but it helps me literally stay alive, the knowledge that if I were to disappear then my crypto would as well. My family would not know how to get my crypto, and I am needed to keep it safe. It is something that stops me from leaving this earth for now, as I feel like I have some treasure that I must keep safe, no matter how bad I feel. \n\n This probably sounds pathetic but it is like having a purpose of sorts even...something that keeps me going. \n\nThank you crypto \\~",

The interest rate on the note is 15% paid monthly and the loan is to be repaid in full in 3 years. Besides the underwriting and obvious risk of the note and contractual issues. In this example we own the note. \n\nI want to create a coin or token that represents the note, but also has the ability to automatically distribute the interest payment to coin owners, is that possible? \nI would also like to be able to mint more coins to represent future notes. Would it be scary to leave thing open ended like that? Ideally the coin owners would have first right of refusal to buy into future note coin offerings. \nI\u2019ve been studying it a lot and have my own framework out together, I\u2019m just wondering what you all think would be a good set up.",

I am earning some money from my job every month, and the only thoughts I have about it is to invest it.

When that stops, it's upto the people to step up and make change.   \n\n\nPeople seem to forget that and governments have become some sort of identity that serves only a small handfull of people's interests. We are too busy with our day to day lives trying to survive, being distracted by meaningless bullshit and until we come together and make change for the better, the world will continue to slump into a hellscape.   \n\n\nThe sanctions are supposed to kick start the people into action and also punish the governments by reducing their citizens ability to make money and pay taxes.   \n\n\nWe can't point fingers when basically the entire west has somehow participated in unethical wars/invasions.   \n\n\nWe don't live in an idealogical world and you just have to deal with it.

There's a war literally right there, which could turn out really bad for everyone involved, they're gonna be suffering some fire from the collapse of the dollar, as it keeps tanking through March even after Feb was proven as the worst month in decades, and now, now they wanna ban and regulate crypto. \n\nThey're literally losing from every side and this won't turn out well for all parties involved. \n\n>European Union lawmakers voted today in favor of controversial measures to outlaw anonymous crypto transactions, a move the industry said would stifle innovation and invade privacy.  \n>  \n>More than 90 lawmakers voted in favor of the proposal, according to documents seen by CoinDesk.  \n>  \n>The proposals are intended to extend anti-money laundering (AML) requirements that apply to conventional payments over EUR 1,000 ($1,114) to the crypto sector. They also scrap the floor for crypto payments, so payers and recipients of even the smallest crypto transactions would need to be identified, including for transactions with unhosted or self-hosted wallets. Further measures under discussion could see unregulated crypto exchanges cut off from the conventional financial system.\n\n(news report)\n\nI don't  get what they're trying to do lmao, they're trying to accuse crypto of being a money-laundering tool? It won't workout like that for all parties involved. I know that many crypto users in the EU are trying to make a living to be able to afford living even with their job, after taxes and all the losses they have to deal with. My friends over there are making 20x off launchpads like sol prime or even going long on BTC despite its massive uptrend and still can't keep up with the cost of living in the EU. \n\nWhat they're doing will not turn out will and they're losing a financial war from every side.",

He used to talk about \"knowledge\" all the time while making videos in his (you guessed it) garage while posing next to a rented Lamborghini. \n\nSelling overpriced useless courses made him millions and now he's trying to sell NFTs, with overpriced NFT mentorship cards that have different tiers valued as high as 18.4 Ether which give the buyer different access to his \"old garage social club\" and access to Tai himself as in spending time, having a phone call and even having a basketball game with him. So please pay this guy no attention when you come across him and all the similar people cause they're giving the platform a bad scammy image. \n\nIf the genuine startups in the market and the people doing hard work on projects everyday got half the attention that these people get, we'd have a better platform. I'm glad there's IDO incubators like solanaprime are helping up and comers expose their projects more widely to investors. \n\nOverall, always DYOR not just about the projects but about rhe backgrounds of these people if you've never heard of him having a real name attached to project is not enough sometimes, dig in the history.",

That was actually around the time when I used my FAFSA check ($3k) to double down on my portfolio of stocks and crypto and 2020-2022 has seen x50 returns for me. I even half-caught the DOGE and Tesla hype, but sold way too early for both (417k coins for $0.08 each smh). Eventually I transitioned all my stock gains into crypto because, besides seeing the ideological and political power it holds, I honestly believe it\u2019s our generation\u2019s stock market and will cause the biggest generational wealth transfer in history.

The reason it causes \u201cproblems\u201d is because when the FED interest rate goes up, the rate for like everything in the US goes up as well, including cars, houses, along other things. Long story short, people have less disposable money to spend. They blame the interest rates for a faltering economy, but in reality, it\u2019s all those damn Covid restrictions and the fact that they are printing money for these \u201cstimulus\u201d packages to the tune of over $540 million every single day and that rate keeps going up.",

The distribution of wealth starts to shift.\n\nSHIB is the ultimate middle finger to the system, the cryptospehere that the banks and whales have taken over.\n\nI think anyone here who mocks SHIB and I\u2019m going to say Saitama\u2026 are simply showing how out of touch they are with the core concepts that made crypto attractive in the first place.\n\nI genuinely believe it won\u2019t be Bitcoin, it won\u2019t be Eth, it will be some coin with little utility and a touch of revolutionary that touches people in a personal (maybe financial wealth) way that will catapult itself to leading the way.  And there will be thousands of niche coins that will follow.\n\nRemember MySpace\u2026 So it\u2019s like a personal website, just scaled down without your own domain and you\u2019re gonna update it yourself and link to friends.  Basic utility, revolutionary concept\u2026 \n\nThen what happens?  MySpace misses its own boat and along comes Facebook, big investment\u2026 world take up.  Parents start to get involved, the kids leave in droves and a shitty music app from China takes over while they share stories via Snapchat and fool their parents who think they\u2019re dancing to Taylor Swift instead of swapping messages that self delete in seconds.\n\nAnd then what?\n\nNew block chains will evolve, Shibarium is already happening.  New eco systems, niche tokenomics\u2026 trendy wallets (Saitamask)\u2026 soon your Bitcoin won\u2019t be of interest and eth won\u2019t be needed by anyone other than the very banks it was meant to take the power away from.  \n\nThat\u2019s not to say BTC and Eth and no doubt many others won\u2019t have pseudo financial value\u2026 but never underestimate the revolutionaries who got pushed out of the revolution.\n\nEdit - and 80+ upvotes for the original post further cements how out of touch this place is.",

If a currency is to be \"the future\", then I think it has to be accessible with or without having personal tech. How does this get resolved?\n\n2. The resource usage. Yes, so many other industries waste a ton of resources, but is it ethical to add so much more? How do we mitigate resource usage for the future? How can it be made sustainable?\n\nI'm not trying to spark debate or say \"crypto bad\". I'm looking for honest, viable answers as to how these issues can be resolved.

The supply of link is capped at 1B so they are not diluting the supply even if the dev team is dumping. If they are dumping, it is from the 30% of the total supply that the devs held for themselves. \n\nThe curious thing about LINK\u2019s tokenomics is that it appears that adoption has not spurred any increases in the price. I thought that companies adopting LINK needed to operate nodes and therefore buy LINK. But there is news everyday of companies integrating LINK and it does nothing for the price. It\u2019s possible that the team is giving them tokens to encourage adoption. I just really don\u2019t know and it\u2019s frustrating.\n\nHonestly, I have a small amount of LINK and feel no compulsion to buy more. Right now, I\u2019m buying DOT, SYS and maybe a little more AVAX. However, LINK fit the profile set forth by OP.",

The trouble is, there are so many amazing projects out there that it is a struggle to shrug a lot of them off, so I keep adding new tokens to my portfolio, which then makes the choice of what to DCA into incredibly hard, because I start to believe I am spreading the love way to thin on the projects I hold due to my limited funds.\n\nI then find myself getting tempted to get out of projects just so I can DCA more ''meaningful'' amounts into others every month. I am in some blue chip projects like ETH and DOT, but it almost feels silly (I know it's not really but it's just so small it feels negligible to me) putting $60 in ETH monthly because I have 9 other projects to add to.\n\nIs it best to reduce the number of projects I am in so I can allocate more cash to each one, or keep them all and keep topping up with these tiny amounts I can afford every month?",

Each pay out 3 rebases a day in interest and have low transaction fees.  \n\nYou could withdraw 1 or 2 rebases a day use that as daily DCA investment capital.  Or you could just let it ride and use the money specifically when the dips occur.  \n\nAlso, \"Blue Chip\" projects like ETH and DOT are nice for long term security but we are in the mist of a bull run.  Now is the time to be more focused on speculative investments with lower market caps that have the potential to break into the TOP 10...Avalanche, Elrond, Fantom.\n\nJust my opinion but I'd be more focused on Smart Contract Platforms as well instead of all these little specific projects.\n\nEth is Eth because Chainlink, Uniswap, Shiba Inu, etc are all built on Ethereum which means every time any of these other projects are traded and or utilized you gotta pay ETH gas fees.\n\nThis is why investments like Solana, Avalanche, Elrond, Fantom are so profitable.  If they can get 1 or 2 star projects on their platforms it increases the need for the native token as you will need it to pay the gas fees on those platforms. \n\nMy view is why buy the mercedes when you can just own the dealership and drive them all. \n\nGood luck to you",

The more I looked into the [technical side](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1BiOcClgDVNESaPA3L7bYw?si=2f42603c53854d12), the less value I perceived. Time and time again I observed people were willing to turn a blind eye to obvious issues in order to generate a sense of hype.\n\nEveryone was willing to believe someone else had figured it out but the closer I came to the emperor's chamber the more I realized that he was [wearing no clothes](https://www.bookbrowse.com/expressions/detail/index.cfm/expression_number/605/the-emperor-has-no-clothes).\n\nA little compromise here, a little blindness there and the great deception is formed.\n\nWhere are the people of integrity?\n\nIf you don't know what I'm talking about I suggest reading:\n\n[The idea that NFTs will allow you to take items between worlds is a pipe dream driven by ignorance. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaverse/comments/tz6520/the_idea_that_nfts_will_allow_you_to_take_items/)\n\nNot only that I have noticed that artificial intelligence is being used here on Reddit to write articles in mass to promote the value of NFTs and crypto. It's the same article over and over and over again with synonyms changed. Then these posts are upvoted by bots creating a fake-news cycle supposedly supported by the masses.\n\nHowever, the [more research I do](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaversestartup/comments/tjc6fk/as_a_gamer_i_would_be_less_inclined_to_play_games/) the less human support I see for this hype cycle.\n\nAre we all just being led along by bots?\n\n# Finally, my question:\n\nI really believe in being objective about things and not just taking a position and being unwilling to change your mind. So I have been talking with industry experts trying to probe and find a way to challenge my own idea of the metaverse.There's one thing that I've been unable to refute concerning a possible value for NFTs, and I came here to see what people think:\n\nIn the past it's been very difficult to track the royalties of art sales. Let's say I create a piece of fine art and I want to give it up in exchange for royalties on its sale to a publisher. I want a transparent way to track this art throughout the web and get my royalties.\n\n# Is there any real, serious, legitimate use case for NFTs?",

Although one good thing that came out of this hype is the fact that it introduced so many new people to the cryptoverse and made crypto shine in the mainstream with so many celebrities and major brands entring the metaverse.\n\nI have hopes that eventually NFTs will start being known for their utility especially now with projects like HBAR foundation allocating huge funds for this exact thing. I think they allocated $250 million just for metaverse development on the Hedera network and they\u2019re gonna start making some changes and steering the NFT market towards utility more especially with companies like UbiSoft on the Heder council helping them do so.",

I was also thinking of possibly grabbing a couple interesting NFT's and opensea seems to like metamask and according to their chart metamask allows for buying eth with credit cards so should be simpler than coinbase which is the other wallet im looking at but that one sounds like the database is stored on coinbases servers. or do i have everything completely wrong?\n\nany help would be greatly appreciated thank you!",

I\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s not really deserving of the 3rd spot in market capitalization.\n\nDevelopment there is notoriously slow and dApp integration hasn\u2019t been the best so far as we\u2019ve seen.\n\nThere are many other cryptos that are deserving of this spot. First one that comes to mind is Hedera considering how much HBAR foundation has been focusing recently on expanding the ecosystem with sustainable projects to the point where its allocating $100 million solely for sustainable project development.\n\nHype plays a major role in this market so don\u2019t always follow it. We\u2019ve seen this with multiple projects ranging from meme coins to projects with actual utility.\n\nSo bottom line is, no matter how good or bad a project is, lack/presence of hype will be a major deciding factor in the success/failure of a certain project (at least initially).",

I was discussing this on the vertcoin sub reddit when my posts all got deleted. I reached out to a few mods and the drama really started to unfold.\n\nMy posts were deleted by a mod who told me themselves the pool owner had threatened to dox them. This pool owner collected personal information by offering to send free merchandise to people.\n\nIt's a shame, because VTC has been around for a long time and has a beautiful hash algorithm, but avoiding this sort of institutional dealings is one of the reasons I and many others are interested in crypto. So I'm finished with VTC, and I'd advise all others to stay away as well.",

But really investing in a new startup or small coin presents a higher risk than reward at most times.\n\nThis is why (and this is before launchpads became a thing) more than 50% of crypto projects would fail without raising a single dollar. Most people lost trust in new projects and new teams. \n\nThe emergence of launchpads made it easy to invest in new tokens, since your guarantee would rely on the reputation of the launchpad itself. Most tokens built on the Binance Launchpad for example lived to see insane highs later on. \n\nBut risk will always be there even if the token is well vetted and presented on a legitimate platform. Because teams can always be motivated by greed to dump the project, rug pull the investors and start another. Some launchpads like sol prime have begun offering insurance fund guarantees because of this situation. \n\nNot only that, but even a legitimate token could be made to look like a pump and dump, That happens when all the investors prior to launch sell at unison immediately at launch... Some launchpads have somewhat solved this with locking token release of private investors or staggering launch sells, but the battle is far from over",

And it was good! It was great for the time that it was and I enjoyed it as much as I did. \n\nBut isn't this a risky venture? Couldn't they have chosen some other field to enter instead. I would assume they would go with starting a whole new token that would be accepted in their virtual store or something, and have that token heavily advertised on launchpads such as Solanaprime for example. Or they could've made a Limewire game simply, that relies on NFT gaming tokens. Or maybe even reintroduced the site, now with P2P research at an all time high. \n\nThey could've gone many ways around this, and I fear the NFT route might've been the riskiest.

So it's really not that hard for someone to figure out your wallet address, especially if you've ever used Fiat because you need an on-ramp for your cash. For those that are completely invisible in this space I commend you, but you are in the vast minority\n\n2) Assuming your wallet address is known, the government can tell you your assets are frozen. That means if you move Crypto in or out of your wallet you go to jail. Sure they can't stop you, but they can watch and arrest you.\n\n3) They want to seize your assets. Same thing, they see your wallet and they tell you to hand over the funds. You resist, you go to jail. They can't actually seize your funds but you still end up in jail.\n\n4) You can flee the country and still use your Crypto, but you'll be on the run and wanted in your own country. Kinda sucks....\n\nThese are the laws that are coming, whether we like it or not. But I would argue they are needed for mass adoption anyways.....so again we arrive at the choice or being completely sovereign or rich.....",

(I already work with some crypto company already).  \nSo far so good, Startup looks legit, some strong names behind it , remote work, global market. Pretty basic in the cryptospace.\n\nHowever, at some point the recruiter mentioned **I could be paid in stablecoin.** \n\nI need to admit, this is the first time it happened to me, so I am pretty unsure of what to think about it.\n\nAnybody in this sub already tried or is being paid in stablecoins ?\n\nI am curious to know what are the pros and the cons of such move ?\n\nAny **risks towards taxes**, your legal status of employee, unemployment etc.. (In  case bad things happens)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks :)",

It's because people are so desperate for massive and instant lottery wins that they will chase and hunt down red flag projects, projects that seem too good to be true, as they often are. \n\nPeople are so desperate for massive success that they will fall for a pyramid scheme that offers 40% returns within a month. Do you think that is achievable? Where do you think these projects are using your money for? \n\nI have to admit, this was once me, but I am no longer interested in massive wins. I'd rather go for small consistent, attainable goals. \n\nThe Turtle will win the race. \n\nI invest in a lot of projects, even those that have already peaked, if I'm confident enough to reinvest in them. I got some bags in ELON even though it did 100x last few months, I know it will go up still. I'd rather have +5% every day than a 100x in one month. \n\nEveryone wants the lottery win, but trust me, a windfall is more responsibility than you need to bear. \n\nI have some bags in other tokens like ADA, which I solemnly believe in, and even though it's dipping, I think I will hold on to those until the end. \n\nDon't let your desperate hunt for money eat your soul.

Caz I wanted to play around with small amounts of crypto B4 I started moving large amounts so I wouldn't loose everything just trying to understand how it works.\nIf the US is taxing every single trade even if they only all total a few hundred dollars isn't that unfairly making it harder for the average person to invest in crypto n future the progression of this new tech. And won't this also cause a huge backflow of tax reports the already overwhelmed government will have to account for and process, causing them huge amount of money and wasting their time better spent elsewhere?\n\nLike shouldn't there be an amount, like a few thousand or something that can be allowed traded/sold every yr. that if u fall under u don't have to report? Wouldn't that save the gov. time and money from having to process that tax info. along with helping the avg. person who's interested in crypto to educate their self and b able to make responsible investment for their future? Wouldn't this also help the further progress of crypto & it's tech. that would ultimately help the US economy and help make it's citizens wealthier by allowing a \"grace amt.\" they are allowed to play around with to help familiarize & educate their self?\n\nBecause not only does the US tax any trades or sales but u also get charged fees for trading/selling. And then most ppl starting out are most likely going to loose money on their trades caz they have no idea what they r doing or how the market works. Not only that but most of these people are taking a huge risk investing their money in crypto because it's so volatile and new it's extremely easy to loose over half ur investment or have ur investment stolen by cyber criminals or scammers that the US doesn't seam to even b trying to regulate. And unless ur extremely wealthy loosing half or all of ur crypto investment is a huge financial hit, so if the avg citizen is taking on all this risk on something with the potential to greatly impact our economy and further tech. why is the US not alot more crypto-friendly?",

So I sold my crypto and fed it all to the bears I\npanic sold. I broke even and felt a little relief. Then when the market rebounded as\nit always has. My meager 2K that I got back would have been 300K. \nBut I was fine. I had a job. Paid my bills.\nAnd what crypto I owned was owned and it was mine. What I really owned was\nhope. And when I sold it I owned nothing that had the potential to change my life.\nJust the day by day grind. Losing it would not have been the end of the world. But\nselling was the end of that exhilaration and excitement of what might have been. I\ndidn't have the metal. You see I owned BTC, ETH and more. We all know where\nthose went and how it is now. So Now when Once I buy I consider the money\ngone. When I do buy crypto now I hold. I'm in this until the bitter end. Or a\nglorious future. I will not feed the bears my hope. So I will keep mv head down and\nstay silent. I won't give others a reason to bash me when crypto is in the red. On\nthe other hand when crypto climbs (as it inevitably always does) when I am asked\nhow did you do it. I will also remain silent then also. It's a long line that will belittle\nwhen the bears feed. But it is also a long line asking how did you do this when the\nbulls run. If they didn\u2019t walk that road with me they would never understand and I don\u2019t owe them an explanation.",

You also lock up your funds for some period of time. \n\nWith others (Cardano, Polkadot, Algorand, and I think Tezos) the worst that can happen is that you lose your reward for that period. For some (not all) of these you lock up your funds for some period of time. Most of these instead elect instead to forfeit some rewards for some period if you move funds early. At best it's passive income and at worst there's a chance you can't move your funds for a while. \n\nWith any \"staking\" (more often called yield/liquidity farming) where you tie your coins up in a smart contract, they are only safe as long as the contract is secure/bug free.\n\nWith any \"staking\" where you transfer your funds to a wallet you don't control, anything can happen and you don't own that money until you move it back to your wallet. You could lose all of it.\n\n---\n\nThe risk profiles are widely different for all the different things called staking. At a protocol level it's pretty safe based on the protocol. Centralised services are not safe and you shouldn't trust them hands down end of question. Smart contract level \"staking\" will be somewhere in between.\n\nTLDR: DYOR. Not all staking is the same.",

Depending on how things are set up it may be more or less complicated but the short is yes.\n\nI'll cover how you would do this with Cardano because that's where I have the most technical experience.\n\nWith Cardano the staking (and most special Tx) are metadata based. This means you can manually produce your staking Tx on the airgapped machine. Alternatively you can produce the Tx on an Internet connected device, exported it to plain, human readable JSON, transfer it to the airgapped machine via QR code or USB, sign the Tx on the airgapped machine, send the signed plain json back, verify it on the internet connected machine, and send it to the network. As soon as the Tx is signed you can spin down the machine, burn the machine, or whatever and your cold wallet will have no opportunity for exfiltration. \n\nBecause of this you can do pretty much anything on the network including staking from a completely airgapped machine. It'll have a bit more friction but that's the whole point of the airgap.\n\n---\n\nSo Cardano, Polkadot, Algorand, and (I believe) Tezos can be staked fully offline as they delegate stake rather than running pools/validators. People running the pools/validators of course must stay online however for at least a number of these even as a pool operator you can structure your architecture such that the wallet isn't online (instead you must manually generate and transfer a VRF key to the validator machine every once in a while).\n\nI can't exactly answer about Ethereum due to my lack of knowledge of the intracacies of ETH 2.0 but at minimum I expect you'll likely be exposed to the pool operator risks mentioned in the previous paragraph. I say this because the minimum requirement for staking is 32 ETH which suggests that stakers will have to run pools. I'm not sure how delegation will exist for ETH 2.0 or if it will be natively supported by the protocol. Of course because ETH 2.0 allows slashing, you could lose your coins if your stake node gets hacked and acts maliciously.\n\nBut generally for networks that allow delegated staking, you can keep your node offline and get rewards. Additionally networks that allow plain Txs to register (most Ouroboros based PoS protocols allow this) can register to stake without ever being exposed to the Internet.\n\nSorry for being so wordy about it but since this is a pretty muddied topic due to the sharing of the term I prefer being as detailed and explicit about it as I can to help.",

I've used both Cardano's staking and other staking coins that lock coins, and the difference is night and day. Algorand and Tezos also have this (Algorand is the easiest to use imo), so it's not unique, but non-locking PoS is definitely the best PoS. Cardano's Ouroboros PoS delegates the wallet instead of some amount of coins. The delegated amount is checked at a particular time every 5 days (called an epoch), and rewards are determined based on your balance at that moment. So your money truly feels like your money, and not some pyramid scheme where the value is pumped by people not being able to move their coins when they stake. \n\nAlso Cardano pioneered extended UTXO instead of account based (ETH and everyone else). There are many advantages to this (that's why it was worth the wait to R&D it through delay after delay), but one of the key ones that stand out is that you can send multiple token types in one transaction. These tokens are already live and working (some people even found ways to NFT with these when smart contracts are still in testnet), so it's not promises and hype, you can go and test them out yourselves. \n\nSo imagine if you want to get 5-6 coin types onto or out of a DEX/swap to yield farm. With ETH you have to pay 5-6 gas fees to get them in, 5-6 gas fees every time you want to move them around. With Cardano it's one transaction. Just click \"add coin\" to the transaction 4-5 times and voila, quick and easy. Oh and Cardano's transaction/gas fees will be fixed. None of that bidding non-sense and failed transactions that still take your money. \n\nIf there's any other functionalities you're curious about, feel free to ask. I hold the vast majority of major (and some minor) platform coins, so I can even go through some direct comparisons if you want.",

            "text": "**EDIT: I appreciate the positive feedback and the kind words. It means a lot.** I hope you all find the chart helpful. Unfortunately though, I'm here to tell you that **I'm not going to update it anymore**. I got **immense back pain** because of my broken chair and I can't continue working like this. I don't have money to buy a new one and considering that I received zero donation/support (aside from 0.5$) it just **isn't worth it for me** to continue working on this chart, and this way also **risking my health.** Again, thank you to everyone for their kind works, I really appreciate them!\n\n\\---\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\nHey everyone! This took me around 300 hours of dedicated work (tons of research and sleepless nights). But I'm finally finished with it and I'm proud to present to you the ultimate, the most complete crypto YouTuber tier list & analysis chart you have ever seen, with so many informations that will blow your mind (hopefully).\n\n\\---\n\n**WHAT IS THIS?**\n\n[A quick look at the Tier List & Ranking tab.](https://preview.redd.it/tinnsygv53371.png?width=2341&format=png&auto=webp&s=41b916243439ca35177bd4314655eeaeed529eb7)\n\nIt's a comprehensive chart of more than 110 crypto YouTubers/channels that incorporates tons of written information and mathematics-driven statistics that helps you to identify the quality and trustability of the given content creators. The chart features roughly 17 different types of data (written and mathematics-driven) for each and every YouTube channel.\n\nThis list doesn't just show you which YouTubers you should subscribe to and why, but also which ones you should avoid and/or which ones you should prioritize if you are looking for price predictions, or guides etc. It paints a complete picture. Or at least as much as it is possible by the work of one man.\n\n\\---\n\n**WHY I MADE THIS CHART?**\n\n[A quick look at the Recommendations tab.](https://preview.redd.it/huksrjz0qy271.png?width=1157&format=png&auto=webp&s=985d5d026a405d5048248708a7d8b1180ce42562)\n\nCrypto is going mainstream. Right now, an overwhelming majority of rookie investors/traders rely first and foremost on YouTube content creators to make their financial decisions and/or to educate themeselves, but it is just as true for the most part in the case of more experienced traders (there are many reasons behind this, but these are irrelevant here).\n\nSo I felt it was important to create some kind of a comprehensive and content rich source that provides as much information and help to people as possible when it comes to these YouTubers they (want to) follow, so they can eventually make the best financial decisions and so on and so forth.\n\n\\---\n\n**DISCLAIMERS**\n\n[A quick look at the Useful Informations tab.](https://preview.redd.it/dkpgrlw1qy271.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=f26cf314087cc81fe65d666eb3185d4405bbaf77)\n\nI'm one man. Even though I have spent 300 hours (more than 2 months) making this chart, it more than likely has some flaws, miscalculations, misjudgements about a channel or person, contradictions etc. It's practically unavoidable when we are talking about this amount of data (you'll see). Also,  I can't know everything about every YouTuber.\n\nBut that's partially the reason why there's so many different types of data for each and every YouTuber. Even if you do not agree with some data (that are less math-driven and more subjective) or even if there's a mistake somewhere, all of the data combined together will more than likely paint a realistic picture about the given content creator.\n\nOh, and I'm also not a native English speaker so sorry for any grammatical errors. Plus I know that token and coin is not precisely the same but for conveniance, I used them interchangably in the chart.\n\n\\---\n\n**HOW TO SUPPORT ME?**\n\n[A quick look at the Currency Summary tab.](https://preview.redd.it/rj6g3sz2qy271.png?width=1262&format=png&auto=webp&s=61e9be93134831f8f2272d1f4ab374d27fe41ead)\n\nJust to make things clear, I'm not some kind of a rich crypto invenstor/trader... far from it. I'm from a relatively poor country and I'm someone who has started crypto only a couple of months ago and invested his spare 660 dollars into proven, good quality coins... a couple of weeks before the big crash... so... you probably guess the ruest. I don't even have money for a new chair so I made this list with continuous and immense back pain because I used this [broken chair](https://i.imgur.com/ZEuhBJH.jpg) while I was working. I still wanted to help people the only way I could in the crypto space.\n\nNow, I would be very humbled and would deeply appreciate it if you would consider doing the same and supporting my work if you found it in any way helpful. This chart is extensive and content rich, I made sure of it, but it's still just a rough blueprint / foundation on which many things can be build upon. And I'll gladly do that if there's enough interest in it and I'm more than happy to let the community to get involved too in this project to help to perfect it.\n\nBut for the continuous development of this chart, I need your help. You can support me by opening the chart, then clicking on the Donation/Support tab (there, you can see all the possible options). Additionally, if you want it, I'll display your name in the Donation/Support tab of the chart so everyone can see that you supported my work.\n\nIf you wouldn't like to support me this way and/or you can't, please, share my work and leave a like on it if you find it helpful so it can reach more people.\n\n\\---\n\n**THE CHART**\n\n[Every single YouTuber\\/channel has an overview\\/intrudiction. Here are a few examples.](https://preview.redd.it/wrja3xx3qy271.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=25275ecfaa7bad71eb586e05d5d24c6ff707f8e2)\n\nI was thinking about explaining how the chart works, but pretty much every single column/row in it has some kind of a written explanation paired with it. The chart has everything you need to won't get lost and to be able to understand every information and data it contains.\n\n\\---\n\n# [LINK TO THE CHART (GOOGLE SHEETS)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bvEmMAq22sxsOSPUFupGoA-I1XYJqfBn/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**You need to be signed in into a Google account in order to be able to view notes, e.g. YouTuber/channel overviews, category explanations etc. (marked by a black triangle in the top right corner). After you have logged in, click on the \"Open With\" button at the top of the screen, then click on \"Google Sheets\".**\n\n\\---\n\n**EDIT 1:** The chart is updated with three Adjusted values (Adjusted Simple Score, Adjusted Complex Score, and Adjusted Tier). These will better reflect the overall quality of the given channel and/or a channel's relative quality to other ones, if you only really want to rely one on statistics to compare them.\n\n**EDIT 2:** Even though I said I'm not going to work on the chart anymore, I made another tab (Best To Worst Ranking) that you can use to check all the crypto YouTube channels in descending order (from best to worst, based on Adjusted Complex Score).",

                            "response": "***\"Why does Jason Pizzino have a 5 for quality\"***\n\nI don't understand this question. There are 5 different metrics that are related to coin predictions in the Tier List & Ranking tab. Also, you can see all of his recommended coins with sources included in the Recommendations tab. Plus you can see how calculations work by checking the Useful Informations tab, or hovering your mouse above any of the metrics you want to check (Change %, Success % etc.). Recommendation/Prediction Quality is based on Adjusted Change % which is based purely on mathematics. The reason why his score is 5/10 is because that's what the mathematics-driven data suggests.\n\n\\---\n\n***\"and a 3 for respectability?\"***\n\nTo quote from the explanation of the Respectability stat:\n\n\"Respectability (I couldn't come up with a better name for this) basically shows how strong the given YouTuber's moral compass is. This can manifest in a lot of things, like how he/she can own up for his/her mistakes (e.g. bad token recommendations), how humble and respectful he/she is to his/her viewers, does he/she brag about the money he/she makes, how clickbaity his/her video titles and thumbnails are, does he/she have time stamps in his/her longer videos, does he/she do promotional videos, or how fast he/she goes straight to the point in his/her videos and how much pointless parts his/her videos have..\"\n\nTo quote from the overview of Jason's channel:\n\n\"This would be an excellent channel if Jason wouldn't spend that much time in each and every one of his videos to shamelessly promote his Instagram and Twitter accounts, as well as practically begging you to subscribe and like his videos before you even watched them.Because the presented content is actually high quality. The channel has daily videos (and occasional streams), pretty much each video has timecodes, and each of these videos contain the most important crypto-related informations for the given day - including news, recommendations about the best coins to invest in, technical analysis etc. (it's very similar to how JRNY Crypto does his videos).\"\n\nSo Jason earns a 3 out of the maximum of 4 Respectability points.\n\n\\---\n\n***\"just noticed BitBoy ends up in a higher tier than him and tbh that's enough for me to think this spreadsheet might be pretty whack.\"***\n\nThere are 17 different types of metrics you can use to measure and compare YouTubers. Don't just look at one. That's lazy, irresponsible and a superficial/shallow way to arrive to a conclusion.\n\n\\---\n\nAlso, to quote from the post:\n\n\"I'm one man. Even though I have spent 300 hours (more than 2 months) making this chart, it more than likely has some flaws, miscalculations, misjudgements about a channel or person, contradictions etc. It's practically unavoidable when we are talking about this amount of data (you'll see). Also, I can't know everything about every YouTuber.But that's partially the reason why there's so many different types of data for each and every YouTuber. Even if you do not agree with some data (that are less math-driven and more subjective) or even if there's a mistake somewhere, all of the data combined together will more than likely paint a realistic picture about the given content creator.\"\n\n**I can make mistakes, sure. But every single data that matters is available to you. You wouldn't have asked the first two questions if you would have taken your time to actually analyze and dwelve deep into the chart instead of just looking at it for a couple of seconds.**",

Most of the teenagers didn't know much of anything similar at that age normally in the past, now because crypto they get info also on other markets and probably by looking up all those info they train themselves on a much broader number of topics than previous generations were doing.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

With all the crypto frenzy this year, I notice some people around me (relatives, friends) started to think that making money trading is very easy, and I think that's very dangerous. I tried explaining them it isn't the case, they shouldn't trade that much money without experience, but they're so full of rush (I get it), they don't even listen.\n\nWHEN a downturn happens, I don't know when it will happen, but it will (it's the same with stocks, sometimes they go up, sometimes they don't), some of these very people will blame crypto as \"scam\", \"fraud\", \"gambling\", etc. It's only gamble if you are a gambler. I know this from experience because there are people calling stock market the same after they lose money. Not before, but after.\n\nIn the end, I think people must educate themselves. They must know rewards and risks before they put their money into a project or trade, no matter how old they are.\n\nTo sum up, I think it's good, but be careful.",

Most people are just searching for yield and looking for a quick buck, they don't care about finance, they don't care about the tech. \n\nI think the real trend is that the internet and social media has turned investing into something more akin to pyramid schemes.  Social media influencers hold more power in the markets than Warren Buffet or CNBC. People shill their bags, coordinate pumps, and dump on their followers. It's all about how viral something can become rather than some fundamental thesis.\n\nPeople getting into finance is not new. Ask your grandparents, they loved gold just as much, if not more than we love our bitcoin. They just didn't have reddit or twitter to shill it all day.",

Company matches 100% up to 6% so for the rest of the time I'd been pumping anywhere from 6-11% into 401k. \n\n\n\nAnyways,  effective this June I will only contribute 7% to my 401k and 3% to crypto. I'm not really interested in what others think of my percentages as I have a damn good financial consultant that understands crypto and the associated taxes like no one I've heard on the internet. \n\n\n\nI've already established a nice nest egg in crypto in just this year. My biggest catalyst was going all in on ADA at $0.07-$0.08 \n\n\nNow I dabble in VET, ONE, XRP & KCS. \n\n\n\nMy gains are consistent and I have no fucks to give on any dips.

It is not about % but about time and amount of money accumulated before investment. \n\nIts very simple; if there is still money to be made in crypto, then it is still a risky gamble. If crypto is certain then very little gain will come cause certainty comes with mass adoption.\n\nIf crypto is still a risky gamble think 17 times about it before you put all your money it. Simply be prepared to loose it - face that possibility otherwise you won't even survive regular dips.\n\nTake care out there folks, this gold fever is bongers. Be patient and stay hydrated.",

Few weeks ago, I made a BNB transaction from trust wallet to binance and forgot to include the correct MEMO ID due to which I did not get my funds to show up at binance. So I had raised a ticket with binance and never heard back. I got frustrated with their lack of response for a long time and sent a message to binance on Twitter saying that they are not responding to my ticket and still did not get a response. On that note, I got an message from one of the groups on Twitter saying that they are from trust wallet and they can help me with this issue. I was sure a fool and believed that they are truly from trust wallet and I did whatever they asked me to do in hopes to recover back my incorrect BNB transaction. I gave them access to my wallet like an idiot by sharing the secret key that they asked me to do and they swiped my wallet clean and left zero balance. I lost a $5,000 worth of coins and one of those coins is 16x today from the time I purchased. So they swiped close to $80,000 from my wallet including the profits I could have made. \n\nThis leads me to think, there must be so many innocent and naive people like me out there. Have any of you faced such an situation ?. Please do NOT do the mistake I did. While this was such an frustrating situation for me to come in terms with, I learnt a valuable lesson for life which I will take with me until I die. I want everyone who is innocent or rather naive and stupid like me to learn from my horrible experience. The feeling is horrendous. I can\u2019t believe that I lost close to $80,000 in a jiffy. Please learn from my experience and never do such a thing I did. Please share your experience if you have any. \n\nLastly I want to combat these brats who claim to be TrustWallet and the ones who steal crypto from wallets. How do we do that ?. I really want to make them cry one day like how they are doing this to possibly thousands of people.",

I knew I was scammed. Luckily I wasnt desperate enough to send money. I told the scammer. Hey can you send me the bitcoin and I will give you half of my $8 K profit. HE says: Sir. It is company policy we do not involve with our clients wallet. ME: What if I gave you $7K of the profit and I kept $1K , can you send me the Bitcoin to withdraw my profit? LOL. HE wouldnt budge and I knew I lost my money.\n\nI cant tell you to not feel bad because it was a mistake. I read a article or a post. It spoke about the psychology of a scam. It really is a mind F\\*\\*K technique. Theres a mental reason why it works. You were in such a need to get your money back, all your other senses did not alert you to a scam.\n\nBro. I believe in God. If you dont, believe in Karma. Those mother F\\*\\*cK\\*\\* will get their due reward...If not in this life the next. I predict you will make 100x what you loss and then some. Dont F\\*\\*CK\\*\\* give up. Use that experience to motivate yourself to make more $$$.\n\nP.S. You are still somewhat in the early stage of the Crypto Blockchain Revolution. I know you can make lots of $$$.",

I get the whole argument about \"fiat burning to the ground\" and whatever through inflation, but we should think about this as a real possibility and not just rhetoric. Is the chance of USD falling to 0 more than BTC falling to 0? It would depend on who you talk to, but I'm willing to say that most economists will say it's BTC which has the greater chance. That doesn't make it a bad asset, and I'm not trying to spread FUD, but let's be realistic.\n\nIf one of the major selling points of Bitcoin is that it cannot be manipulated by central authorities, then we must admit that central authorities couldn't artificially prop it up. This is unlike USD which has central authorities (like the Fed and Treasury Dept) who are willing and able to actively manipulate it to keep it stable during a black swan event or sustained recession.\n\nI'm happy for everybody that's made money on BTC or any other crypto. Good on you. I just also want to make sure we're not all swept up so hard in the bull market fervor that we forget reality.\n\nThe reality is that crypto and Bitcoin in particular are risky assets. We should make sure that we prepare ourselves for that risk, no matter how much we believe in it. Hope doesn't drive returns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> And since the market is too volatile at times, you could stake for a year in a bear market and still protect your investment thanks to very high APYs \n\nEarning 6% APY on BlockFi (not dissing them, I use their service and actually endorse them) isn't going to be a good consolation for a lot of hodlers here who have been seeing that gain per day for the last few months. It wouldn't make up for a 40% crash, especially if it's a sustained crash like last time -- from Dec. 2017, it took till Dec. 2020 to get back to 17k. That's a long time for a lot of the very young investors here. Just keep in mind that the downside risk changes when you introduce lending APY, but it doesn't reduce so far as to make it equivalent to cash lending, even if cash lending rates are almost 0%. That APY won't last forever as the market starts to saturate further and further. We're already seeing rates decline for Bitcoin lending through BlockFi, Celsius, etc.\n\nThere are a lot more borrowers in a bull market than in a bear market. The amount of borrowers and demand for collateral drives APY up. Without those same borrowers, we'll see lower and lower interest rates. This is just a byproduct of supply and demand, which is why cash lending is so bad right now. It's already oversaturated. Just because the crypto market isn't yet doesn't mean it isn't heading there. It is. I'm greatly enjoying the APYs right now, particularly on stablecoins, but I don't think we can live in a world where it stays as high as it is forever. We should expect it to eventually fall in line with cash lending, especially if we believe that Bitcoin will gain in adoption and crypto will become more and more mainstream.\n\nThis isn't a bear thesis on crypto. I think Bitcoin will continue to run in the long term, but I'm also trying to provide the other side of this argument: reality doesn't care about how much fervor and blind faith we have. We should expect to lose money along the way and no asset class is guaranteed to succeed, boom, or do anything in particular. The open market, something BTC hodlers are adamant about preserving (and so am I), can be cruel to those who choose to live under rocks.",

Lots of small projects pump hard during a bull run and its easy to find yourself fantasizing about potential gains. This is FOMO. Don't fall for it. When this bull run ends, and it will eventually end, it will hit small cap coins the hardest. In 2-3 years, most of these projects will die.  \n\n\nMy financial advice is to take this time to accumulate BTC and ETH. I know. You're going to see all these random coins people shill on here go 1200% in a week. And that FOMO feeling creep up. Use this time to learn as much as you can. For other coins, don't watch USD price. You need to be watching price to BTC to ETH. Watch what happens when it goes back to bear market. Price to BTC to ETH will crater. THAT is when you want to be accumulating small caps using the ETH and BTC you saved up. The small caps that keep grinding during the bear market and don't disappear, those are the ones to invest in.  \n\n\nThis will put you in a very good position come next bull run. No one gets rich in a few months. They do it over the course of a few years during the bear market and then they harvest those gains the following bull market.\n\n::::THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE:::::",

Many of you have raised concerns that the bot is quite hard to set-up and operate, so there are some pretty cool news that I would like to share.\n\nWith over 1.4k people on our server talking, testing and adding their input on the crypto trading algorithm, and 2.3k stars on GitHub it's clear that this project has massively outgrown its initial bounds.\n\nIf you're not sure what this is all about let me quickly break it down for you before I go on:\n\nThis is a crypto trading engine that analyses all coins on Binance and detects the most volatile ones in order to catch a potential mooning.\n\n* The bot will listen to changes in price across all Coins on Binance paired to USDT\n* The bot checks if the any coin has gone up by more than 3% in the last minute\n* The bot will buy 100 USDT of the most volatile coins on Binance\n* The bot will sell at 2% profit or 2% stop loss\n* There is a sandbox mode to test our different strategies\n* A pause mode, to stop buying once the market goes bearish\n\nThis just a configuration example, and you should experiment with these parameters to figure out what works for you.\n\nI'm excited to say that we are now a team of developers, and not just myself working on this project, and we're working on a more full fledged version of this bot with a proper front-end for config editing, profit loss tracking and more. This is huge as it allows us to add more powerful features onto it.\n\nIf you're interested in the project and would like to be part of the early access, head over here and register your interest: [https://www.cryptomaton.org/binance-crypto-volatility-trading-bot/](https://www.cryptomaton.org/binance-crypto-volatility-trading-bot/)\n\nIf you want to know more about it, or try out the initial version available as open source code, see this link: [https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/06/05/the-future-of-the-binance-volatility-trading-bot/](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/06/05/the-future-of-the-binance-volatility-trading-bot/) It contains some useful links to guides and more resources\n\nLastly, if you're great with coding and just want to play around with the code, no fluff see the GitHub repo: [https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/Binance-volatility-trading-bot](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/Binance-volatility-trading-bot)",

If you buy into the original goals (I do) and see Central bank inflationary economics as an issue then BTC has your solution. It also has network effect, but it can\u2019t scale in current form to be more than a global reserve currency and at massive energy cost\n\nETH in money 2.0 and has smart contracts but the approach to gas and EVM doesn\u2019t scale and has the same POW problem as BTC. It doesn\u2019t have the same monetary policy so it can\u2019t displace the reserve role. It may transition to PoS successfully in which case that issue evaporates.\n\nADA as the native base token for Cardano has the same hard monetary policy as BTC. It use PoS so use about a million times less energy (or put another way can do a million times the work for the same energy). PoS is now proven working and has good academic basis (game theory).\nNative tokens are in place on Cardano. Right now you could port any standard POW coin to it and run it with a fraction of the energy.\n\nBut the big prize is smart contracts and rightfully people are skeptical till they land. But the implementation as designed is good and projects will move fast once they have an easy migration route via ERC20 converter. If it lands in August as promised it puts Cardano in a viable position to shoot for number 1. It\u2019s worth a punt even if the odds of it actually happening are 1 in 20 because the returns will be astronomical.\n\nCardano is built on granite. Haskell is the basis and is a functional programming language. You can have a high confidence that what is written will work as expected. Choosing it came with a high cost to the project as it slowed delivery a lot, and as you see from this thread they are still living with that legacy. Time will tell if they chose correctly:)",

Just like J-Js beats 10-10s or A-K is a huge favorite against A-Q. Otherwise, you are going to loose all your money in DAY 1. Similar in crypto you must learn the basics. I have friend who entered the space 2 months ago, and although he trades in Binance every day, he never downloaded metamask or sent an eth transaction just for the sake of the experience to understand what are these gas fees that everybody talks about. So, in other words, you need to have an all round view of the crypto space and learn the basics!\n\n**2. Play solid hands - Through away trash hands**\n\nEvery book that has been written by the legendary poker players, such as Doyle Brunson, Phil Hellmuth or Stu Ungar to name a few, the number 1 rule is to play solid pairs and fold trash hands, meaning A-As K-Ks etc vs 10-3 or 7-2. And although in crypto is a bit subjective of what can be considered a \u201cgood hand\u201d there are some characteristics that can keep you away from scam coins and identify these solid coins. There might be a lot of factors that each one of you is considering when researching for a coin, such as the market cap, total supply, the team behind, the technology, the fees etc, if I had to choose 1 factor as the most important, I would personally choose the use case. If I see myself (and others) not only now but in 5-10 years using this technology and is superior in comparison with other crypto projects, that would be the identifying factor that will make me feel that a have the nuts\\* (\\*terminology for the best hand possible)\n\n**3. Big Pairs - Small Pairs / Big Cap \u2013 Small Cap**\n\nAs in poker I would always bet my money in a pair of A-As against any other hand. Similarly, some can argue that he will always invest their money in BTC, ETH and any of the top 20. But what happens when you have small pair such as 3-3s or 5-5s, your opponent has A-K and the flop comes A-3-7? You flopped a monster. So try to find these 50-200mil market cap pocket pairs and wait!\n\n**4. Be patient \u2013 Hodl**\n\nThis brings us to the next big lesson which is to be patient and hodl. Occasional and recreational poker players that go out in a casino drinking and laughing (which is good by the way, don\u2019t get me wrong) are entering pots with every single hand they are dealt with, trying to make their 100$ into 10.000$ overnight, which of course is not possible. 99% percent of these players always call, playing too many hands, are not patient to play solid hands and usually what happens is they always go broke. You can spot the good poker player in a table a) by entering very few hands-pots \u2013 is patient and b) has usually the biggest stack \u2013 knows how to hold and protect his bankroll. Likewise, in crypto don\u2019t try to become a millionaire over a night, trying to ride every coin that pumps during that day. That is not possible. Be patient and hodl.\n\n**5. Be aggressive and do not be intimidated.**\n\nIn big corrections you always hear that big whales are trying to shake week hands. Well guess what, this expression comes out from poker. If you are seated in a poker table with 500$ and the guy opposite has in front of him a 20.000$ stuck, what you think he will try to do? He will use this chip stack as a big stick and is going to whip the sh\\*t out of you and take all your money. So do not be intimidated when big wales trying to boss you around with their bankrolls!\n\n**6. Bluffs, Trash talking, and staying away from traps.**\n\nIn a poker table, the professional poker players know that sometimes cards don\u2019t even matter, and they can very easily make you fold the best hand, while make you call with the worst hand. So, whatever they are telling you, think twice before you act because there is a reason why they are telling you. They want you to call or they want you fold! Similar in crypto, think twice before Elon Musk or any youtuber tells you what the next gem coin is, cause there is a reason why he is telling you. They want you to buy or they want you to sell!\n\n**7. Value Betting**\n\nA good poker player always knows how to make the maximum amount of money from each hand. He rarely over/under bets his hands, carefully calculating his pot odds and tries to keep his loses to the minimum. He knows when to get in and knows when to get out. In crypto the num.1 rule that everyone says (although not a lot of people follow, including myself) is to buy low and sell high. Follow this, and you will maximize your winnings both in poker and in crypto.\n\n**8. Improve your game**\n\nI remember myself when I started playing poker and loosing big time, I took the decision to educate myself and learn how to beat this game. I read books, I watched endless hours of WSOP and WPT tournaments and gradually I improved my knowledge of the game. Similarly, as there is not a poker university there is not a crypto university. You have to do the work, meaning you have to spent many hours in youtube, reddit, twitter researching and developing your knowledge about blockchain and crypto, reading the whitepapers and figure it out by yourself!\n\n**9. Learn from others more experienced that you.**\n\nThere is a saying in poker which goes \u201cIn a poker table you always get advice from people with less chips than you\u201d Meaning that loosing-bad players (hence they have less money) are always keen to give you advice. In poker you must look at the experienced and successful players and try to follow how they became so successful. To illustrate the above I will use more like a personal example. In crypto, I have 2 friends both from high school, both computer engineers, one very clever and the other let\u2019s say not very clever and really stubborn. Guess what, the clever one who was one the early adopters in BTC backed in the days has a lot of chips and the stubborn one who joined crypto 3 months ago has only like 5 blinds left\\*(poker terminology for minimum bet). Whenever I followed the picks of my clever friend as to which coins to go after, I ended up making a lot of money, and whenever without asking for advice, my stupid friend shilled coins as the next big think and pressuring me to buy them, I ended up losing. So be selective as to who, either in real life, in YouTube or twitter choose to listen.\n\n**10. Don\u2019t be a fish**\n\nIn a poker table it is said (as in the famous Rounders movie with Mat Dilan) that if you cannot spot the fish\\* (poker term for sucker, worst player) in the first hour of the game, then YOU are the fish. And throughout any game session, money always change hands in a poker table from the new players to the more experienced ones, from fishes to sharks and whales. You just have to decide what do you want to be, a fish or a shark\u2026.?\n\n* my big hands (A-As, K-Ks, Q-Qs) are BTC, ETH, & VET\n* my middle pairs (J-Js to 8-8s) are BAT, NANO & NEAR\n* and my small pairs (7-7s to 2-2s) are VITE, BAN & CSPR\n\n*Let me know in your comments what are yours ;)*",

As in poker, some of these people are genuine and like passing on their knowledge to others, but others just got \"sucked out on\" and they're pissed at you because they either just lost to you because of luck or you out played them in an unorthodox way. Know who is who.\n\nTo those that like to tell everyone how they \"should\" play just because you think you're way is the \"right\" way remember that people are using their own money and are allowed to play how they want to. If you're trying to be helpful and save someone from losing their money, sometimes you just have to let them learn on their own and your words don't mean anything to them.",

So once you have some gains, maybe it could be a good idea to convert some of them on stable coins, and continue hodl a part of your funds. This way you have some diversification and the funds in stable coins are safe. Also consider some kind of staking or so, in order to maximize your gains. There are many options for many coins. But for example if you get OUSD as a stable coin, they'll earn you some interest just by staying in your wallet. I prefer it to other stable coins for long-term holding....it's like staking but without the hassle of locking your funds.",

Lucky for me my largest buys were the first two.  To make the math easy let's just say I bought 500 shares at $8 and again at $16. so they are equally weighted. My dollar cost average at this point in time was 8 + 16 = 24. since I bought an exact number of coins both times don't need to account for an overweighted position. so it's basic math. 24/2 = $12 = average price per share (per coin) of LINK. best times to buy as much as you can is whenever a correction is strong enough that it dips below your ave price per coin (dollar cost ave.) The more you can afford at prices below your ave price per coin the better, because it will carry heavier weight, and bring your average down.   \n\n\nHowever in crypto with the craziness in volatility and moonshots happening, sometimes you may never get a chance to lower your ave price bought per coin. now that's just a great position to be in. likely up 100s of %. so simply buy on strong dips. I like adding on dips of 10-12% or more. Hope that was helpful.  Oh and download the app [https://blockfolio.com/](https://blockfolio.com/)\\- it will do all the work for you. YOu can have it import all your transactions. histories from every account you have, and instantly know exactly what your average price per coin is. it's important to track this stuff. Hope you at least start with that! It's a killer app, you can also buy crypto or see prices across every platform out there all at once. i mainly use for portfolio tracking.   \n\n\nCheers",

Is this realistic? At the start, I put 100 in and about 3 weeks after that, it turned into 1200, wow. THATS MORE THAN I MAKE IN 6 MONTH OF WORK AT MY SUPERMARKET.\n\nI just really want this man, I want it so bad. Give to my family, not work for a shitty ass boss, travel the world, maybe open a dispensary or something (that would be so sick), smoke weed, and do whatever the fuck I want.\n\nI've already learnt so much and I'm so happy I got myself into crypto. I wish everyone the best of luck who's trying to do the same thing as me.",

Sure it's done very well for a lot of people. But there absolutely no guarantee that it will continue to do so. \n\nThere's no way the current crop of coins can all be successful over the 25 year timeframe you're looking at. There's no way you can know which coins will do well and which will die. This is a gamble.\n\nSure you might get lucky and achieve your dream. Or you might lose everything. If you're ok with that risk they good luck to you. But please don't forget that all crypto is a gamble right now. The usual advice is always: Never gamble more than you can afford to lose!",

The best way to financial freedom is to use your gains from crypto + money from working to buy an asset that can produce you income. Cheapest easiest example is a car. Next step up, a rental property. Once you have things that can make you money then you can trade crypto and shoot for moons without having to worry about converting crypto back to fiat to live day to day.",

(AVAX is also, but it feels wrong to me. DOT likewise feels to me like it won\u2019t be a winner long term, in part due to lacklustre marketing and lack of passionate users. I could easily be wrong about AVAX and DOT, but ya don\u2019t need to catch every winner.)\n\n20% LUNA \u2014 enables stablecoins in any currency, and other DeFi products, including simply payments. The more people buy the related stablecoins and stake to use the DeFi products, the more LUNA gets burned/locked and so the value goes up (the reverse is also true).\n\n15% ARWEAVE \u2014 decentralized hard drive:  pay-once-store-forever on blockchain. E.g. where will people store their NFTs? E.g. The Apple pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong just permanently stored their back issues on ARWEAVE when they got shut down by China.\n\nAll solid coins, each for different reasons, and my investment has doubled in the last month.\n\nAlso, DCA (dollar-cost-average: look it up) when you buy and when you sell\u2026 no need to \u201csave up\u201d and buy all at once, or try to sell all at once predicting the exact top of the market cycle.\n\nAnd watch Ben Cowen\u2019s Into The Cryptoverse on YouTube to learn about the crypto market cycle.",

Better fees when using Pro, great staking options and love the pro interface! \n\nAlso started up on Blockfi for some additional passive income. \n\nThis community rocks!",

Though you should still get those fixed I guess...\n\nAs for the universe telling you to hodl, well, not sure if it's that, but it is very possible that you will thank that at some point as usually most of the coins in a year got at least 5x, often much more and as well often people are not patient enough and sell much before at the first panic moment or at the first remarkable gain.\n\nIt happened to me once with OGN, staked 1 year, did 3x back then and was googling and asking in their channels how to end the staking before the terms lol. Luckily it wasn't possible and I was angry, but by the time I could really unlock my OGN, it was 10x (didn't sell all though, got enough profit for initial investment and now I am staking another year, the project has a lot of new things cooking and has plans for long term).",

            "text": "I was growing up in a not-so-poor family compared to my village's average standards in Eastern Europe, but was still always jealous and wanting more nonetheless. I knew it my whole life that I would need my own place, preferrably a house, since I don't want to live with my abusive family and I just want to forget them.  \n\n\nUntfortunately, my mental state doesn't really allows me to live with someone else. I have developed a serious sleeping disorder during my decades long depression and I am only able to sleep when I am totally exhausted and even then, I wake up on the slightest noise. I live in my 2nd rented apartment on my own and my life is hell due the loud neighbours (not with my standards, generally) and the careless landlord.   \n\n\nThis just strengthened me in my vision that I will have my own home, no matter what. Until I reach my goal, I can't have my peace. Recently my mental state started to decrease rapidly due to the current covid situation and the exposure of the negative news everywhere. I started to calculate when would I be able to pay the minimum amount to apply for a bank loan and the results were devastating. I desperately started to look for extra income opportunities because I couldn't sleep. My mind was ticking...   \n\n\nI am a senior software developer at one of the biggest IT companies worldwide, in Austria and still, considering the housing prices, I would need at least 15 years from now on from my salary to have the minimum payment for the loan. I am 28. I couldn't accept this.  \n\n\n\\*\\* Please before you start telling me how much you think I earn and I could do it easily, I didn't tell you everything about my life, situation, family and so on. So please instead of assuming things just read it through. Thank you!\\*\\*  \n\n\nOf course, the WSB -> GME crazyness got my attention too and I dived into this whole retail trader stuff to make some quick bucks. As the 99% does, I thought I am part of the 1% who will make it. My friend investing in stocks for a year now and when I asked him to help me buy GME at 31$ just before the whole thing, he told me not to do it because it maybe goes up to 40, but will fall down again, I can invest in better stocks which will have better short term returns... You can guess the rest. I was devastated. Looking at the stock price booming basically destroyed my sanity and I of course FOMOed all in. I think I don't have to mention that I was too late. Thank god I was too paranoid checking it every second and on a feeling, I got out with only -400$...  \n\n\nSo, learning the lesson I am not mature and emotionally disciplined enough to do this, I started to look for another way. Being interested in IT and tech, the a blockchain article caught my attention and I started to read about it. I bought myself a PC with an RTX 3070 in december, so I started to experiment with GPU mining. Of course I got addicted to it, it made me feel alive for the first time since years and it was \"free money\" coming in. Naturally, the amount is insignificant in itself and we are talking about \\~200$ a month, minus the electricity which is .21/kW here. So not a big profit, but still... I started to join crypto related subreddits and facebook groups and day after day I was reading more and more about it. Decentralization, NFTs, PoW, PoS and so on until I bought my first non-minable coin and I decided to build up my crypto portfolio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started on 16th of February and since, my portfolio's value almost doubled itself with the investments I made in it. I tried trading too and although, being in plus with it (+100$ or so), I decided just to be a HODLer and patiently to wait it out. In this almost two months, I have more money saved up in my portfolio than what I had after 2 years of saving before. I finally start to believe that my goal and hope for a normal life with sleep and without anxiety is possible. All thank to this technology and the promise it holds. Not only the money, but the change in the whole financial system and sentimentality of the world. It's funny because my mental condition allows me to speak freely about anything, because I honestly don't care. But I really wanted to share this.",

And it outsold all if its more tech advanced competitors.",

You own any significant amount of cryptos - apply the same things you would have done to make it easy for your future heirs to receive your fiat/stocks/belongings/houses/etfs/whatever:\n\nDocument everything you own, commit to proper portfolio tracking, leave instructions\nwhere to find and how to access your wallets (and related stuff like tax reports/portfolios), write down notes on everything you believe won't be common knowledge for anyone unrelated to crypto.\n\nThen copy all you just did and leave it in at least two different secure places, notice them in your will. I know it's a lot, but that's the way it should be done so even nocoiners can access your funds and cash out (or even better: understand and evaluate your holdings). They will probably be having a hard time anyways given the fact you've gone, don't let inaccessible money overshadow everything.",

            "text": "In this post I would like to break down how we do promotion in Dracula, without going into technical details in the text, during our development we have made many updates, launched Snapshot DAO voting and constantly improving our product.\n\nBut over time, we began to realize that the entire decentralized finance industry was becoming detached from the Crypto industry. Advertising, PPC, CPA and other classic techniques would be a bad sign. We are aware of this fact and consciously refuse classical marketing methods in favor of Growth Hacking techniques.  \n\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/cwfcf07246q61.gif\n\nComDev is an integral part of any startup. The vector of work is defined based on the user problem your product is going to solve: how the person now solves that problem, what he likes and dislikes about existing solutions, what ideas he himself has for improvement, etc. But if you try to define the problem your startup is solving, you will come up with too general an answer.\n\n*We realized we were on the right way and continued to make our community happy.*\n\nIn the DeFi industry, the user, in most cases, doesn't have a sharp and perceived problem that the product solves. However, that doesn't stop developers from reaching billions TVL.\u00a0\n\nWe conducted a series of surveys of our participants, for this almost 3 months we had to personally talk to almost everyone and find out what ideas and comments exist in general. This also helped to understand the mood of the market. Most were very frustrated that we had a very small community and almost no communication in the chat room.\n\n*As part of our work, we decided to attract more people through Growth Hacking.*\n\n**Music. Everyone loves music.**\n\nHaving studied the main sources of attracting new users (imageboards, social networks, forums and specialized sites) we came to the conclusion that the maximum conversion rate can be achieved with mentions placed in rare places, so we came up with the idea of releasing our own track on Spotify and Deezer.\n\nWe found a musician who agreed to do a track for us and record it. We were very happy to support him, and he in turn was grateful for our help.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qxrlz6x446q61.jpg?width=2358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c9c1bc1ff040ff690ad268960e9dcf4dc152fa6\n\nThat's how we became the first project at DeFi with our track in Spotify and people started talking about us. In itself this action brought only 4 thousand listens, but the very fact of the statement as a manifesto impressed a lot of people.\u00a0\n\n**Sticker-pack. Why does it matter?**\n\nCommunicating without stickers in messengers and social networks now seems unthinkable, and even in business correspondence stickers have become accepted as the norm. At the same time, the use of stickers has its own trends and etiquette: while some pictures are becoming fashionable, others are losing relevance.\n\nWe asked the community to make a sticker pack by themselves and they turned out very funny, each of the stickers reflects some kind of pain of the project.\n\nWe also made our own official sticker pack, the number of installations of which has already exceeded 500.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qlsa1yk646q61.jpg?width=398&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d71e10846b5e9a61a35308433fbda4f284758b6\n\n**Cheers from Admin:**\n\nWe have deployed our core V2 contracts on mainnet!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n9aplau746q61.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37b4febd76c4f8c92844fe91cc06b5bd19703b08\n\nAlthough vampires prefer the dark, we believe our future is bright!\n\nDracula subreddit: r/Draculaprotocol",

Note: The following doesn't mean that Doge is a bad trade as it could continue to go ballistic in the near future, just that I would never want to hold it as a long term investment where I just stick it in cold storage and try to forget about it.\n\nDoge has block reward of 10000 Doge per block and a new block is written every minute on average.  This block reward will never change.  ie. no halvening\n\nIf you make the unrealistic assumption that everyone who buys Doge holds on to it and everyone who mines Doge sells it, then to keep the price at 26 cents there needs to be almost 4 million dollars of Doge purchased every day.\n\n10000\\*.26\\*60\\*24 =3,744,000\n\nIf the price got to $10 the Market would need to purchase 144 million dollars of Doge per day to keep it that high.\n\n10000\\*10\\*60\\*24 =144,000,000\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: This can be more difficult when you have something like Ripple where there is an entity that created and \"pre-mined\" the coin and owns a huge percentage.  Because even though there is 0% inflation (excellent for long term investing), you never know when that entity is going to unleash a large chunk of supply on the Market.",

I like that it is a proof of work coin that will have a large degree of interoperability with Cardano. ETH miners will have to go somewhere when proof of stake comes. As ADA progresses in terms of development and adoption, I believe that Ergo will go along for the ride and provide Cardano with benefits that can only be had with proof of work consensus.\n\nWhen risk:reward is so incredibly skewed towards reward, you don\u2019t need to invest a lot of money to potentially generate a large return. To answer your question more directly, my initial interest in a particular coin is usually generated by hearing people I respect speak favorably of it. From there I will do whatever research that needs to be done. Otherwise, I stick to big names that have a large amount of adoption and mindshare behind them. Centralization is usually a disqualifier though. Example of that would be Binance Coin and XRP. Gains are nice, but I just can\u2019t bring myself to hold my nose and buy some.",

So the previous time I met up with my supplier/friend I suggested the idea that we\u2019d start using crypto stablecoins for payment and he was on board. I started teaching him about wallets and how to operate them and we were good to go very fast surprisingly. We started using e-Money for our exchanges since they barely press any fees and just like that, I saved up thousands of dollars in bank fees every month.

Pyramid schemes use uplines and downlines to tranfer money from one person to another, with the high person in the pyramid getting a cut of everything and quite rich.

They can serve as a store of Value (Bitcoin), a currency( Monero), a platform for other Apps ( ETH), with many use cases. They are based on Blockchain,  which decentralizes finance and records,  and stores the info on computers around the world. \n\nFor example you can invest in a project designed to record, validate, and privatize  Medical records. Hospitals and insurance companies may use these in the future. Your records will be private and never lost.  \n\nYour can lose money with crypto by investing in a poor coin or project.

In short, this is a process during which users temporarily lock up some of their assets in order to recieve rewards or interest. This can include liquidity mining, staking, lending, minting and anything in between. Basically, anything that lets you \u2018harvest\u2019 additional yields on your assets (next to a potential price increase of the underlying asset).\n\nThese rewards come in different forms, such as in the very same asset that was originally deposited, or in a totally different one. Or in multiple different assets, even. These assets can then be put to work again, in order to accrue additional rewards, which can be put to work again. And so forth. Yield farmers can participate actively in multiple yield farming strategies on different protocols or blockchains at the same time, too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n9ds8m9focp61.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff51d72f2305b023444ea5be4b492a71153fefb4\n\nYield farming has been there since the very beginning of the DeFi boom during the summer of 2020. Arguably, it was the meteoric rise of yield farming options as well as the DEX that formed the moat of this boom. Since then, DeFi has been on an unstoppable run and an ever increasing amount of money is being circulated (and generated). Today, there is hardly a DeFi protocol that doesn\u2019t incorporate at least some form of yield farming and it has become an unmistakable pillar within the world of crypto.\n\nAs you might expect, participating actively can quickly turn into a highly complex operation. And an expensive one too, as each seperate transaction requires more gas, or fees, to be paid by the user. This is explains, in part, why yields can often be so attractive; Actively farming is labor-intensive, expensive and complicated.\n\n*But that\u2019s about to change.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9rw84epiocp61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=009fd21076cb7345a331ff4839f6ecffe8eb261e\n\nDracula Protocol V2 fully automates these complex and expensive processes, and makes it as easy as clicking a button for anyone to earn the highest yields possible on their assets. But perhaps more importantly, Dracula also eliminates the gas fee problem alltogether, further adding to its\u2019 user returns.\n\nTo achieve this, the Dracula team has built out a protocol-agnostic platform that is able to communicate with any protocol and collect rewards autonomously. It takes all the hard work out of yield farming under a single web interface. Which is great, but there\u2019s more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/709i697locp61.png?width=1109&format=png&auto=webp&s=35eff58c4eef6877060e56c6eb586a071528313f\n\n## Gas elimination\n\nGas fees are another major issue, often forcing regular users out of lucrative opportunities. Dracula Protocol drastically reduces fees so that regular users are priced out no more, and turns the money saved into additional yield.\n\nIt achieves this by cleverly pooling user funds together. This way, Dracula only requires a single smart contract interaction to act on the behalf of an entire pool, versus thousands of individual interactions required otherwise. This single transaction fee is then spread out over the entire pool, resulting in an extremely low fee per user. All this capital saved is then distributed back to users in the form of additional yield.\n\n## Whale power\n\nWhales dominate the markets through sheer firepower. In yield farming, that is no different. Each whale owns a large piece of a specific pie, and gets to take home the best returns while excercising control over the market. They leave individual holders vulnerable, who risk being dumped on while chasing lower returns. Dracula Protocol was originally designed to combat exactly this.\n\n>To fight a whale, one must become a whale.\n\nA third major benefit to Draculas\u2019 pooled farming is its \u2018whale power\u2019. Every market Dracula enters, it enters with the combined firepower of thousands of individuals. This allows Dracula itself to act like a whale entity on behalf of its users and claim a significantly larger piece of the pie, bringing home even better returns. It levels the playing field and is able to fight other whales on their own terms. With the added comfort of full automization and significant gas savings.\n\n*But it gets even better.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/va4g4c8oocp61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=530db37c81e750d1ed11511db54094d0a4c5d74f\n\n## Profit compounding\n\nAs explained earlier, one temporarily lock up his/her funds in order to accrue rewards. The longer the lock-up, the more rewards to be claimed. To maximize returns during this period, however, one would ideally claim rewards and re-stake regularly. This allows one to continue farming with a larger stack, which accrues more rewards and so forth. This is known as \u2018compounding\u2019. But compounding is labor-intensive and expensive, with each transaction setting you back additional gas fees. Often times, this is only worth the effort (and money) after an extended period of time and significant rewards. This is sub-optimal as no compounding takes place in between, making you miss out on additional gains.Dracula fixes this through its extremely low gas fee structure and automization capabilities. This allows Dracula to collect and compound rewards on a daily basis autonomously, while only having to pay for a fraction of the gas fees.\n\n## Additional yield booster\n\nAs if a single web interface, full automation, higher returns, massive gas savings and auto-compounding isn\u2019t enough, there is one last trick up Draculas\u2019 sleeve.Dracula built a second, interest-earning layer on top of the automized yield aggregation process. Partner Rari Capital is integrated to achieve this. This is designed to function as an additional yield booster, actively earning users interest on top of their growing capital. It automatically switches between the most efficient interest-earning strategies available, itself always ensuring the highest additional returns as well. Mind you this profit on top of profit is being auto-compounded on a daily basis, only further adding up for its users.\n\n>Dracula Protocol V2 is set to launch early April 2021\n\n# ETH and DRC\n\n## $ETH\n\nSo what if you\u2019ve turned enough profit and you\u2019d like to cash in? Normally, you\u2019d be left holding multiple types of tokens you\u2019d have to have to sell individually. Another labor-intensive, expensive task. But not with Dracula.Dracula is unique in that it \u2018s able to convert everything for you, and allows you to withdraw your profits into a single token, namely $ETH or $DRC (stablecoins might be next). This eliminates another burdensome part of yield farming and offers you direct exposure back into DeFi\u2019s native currency, without having to do anything.But there\u2019s another option.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7z3vc4cvocp61.jpg?width=419&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5bd0474b001aaf756ac8c40ca826cfc5f6a2da9\n\n## $DRC\n\n$DRC is the native currency of Dracula Protocol (Not to be confused with \u2018Digital Reserve Currency\u2019). When a user opts to be paid in $DRC, something interesting happens.\n\nThis $DRC doesn\u2019t come from minting and releasing extra tokens, like so many protocols do today. Adding to a (hyper) inflationary token design. All $DRC has already been minted and is out on the open markets. And its supply is capped, meaning no extra $DRC can ever be released. Instead, a buyback mechanism is activated and every time a user collects profit, this $DRC is bought up straight from the open markets, adding buying pressure to the token.\n\nThis could potentially lead to strong, automized buying pressure to a capped, non-inflationary token. Community members sometimes refer to $DRC as a \u2018self-pumping\u2019 token. And it actually kind of can be. It\u2019s not hard to imagine what a potential $200,000,000 Total Value Locked on the protocol earning high yield for its users each day could do to buying pressure when 50% chooses to receive their rewards in $DRC. Taking into account $DRC\u2019s current $12 milion market capitalization, that might not be a bad proposition.\n\nIn the future, a token burn mechanism might be introduced through community governance as well. Say, 0.5% per payout. Enough to actively reduce supply, but to maintain market-beating returns. The thought of a \u2018self-pumping\u2019, deflationary token is not that far off with $DRC. No matter how ridiculous that may sound.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/czb92nb2pcp61.gif\n\n# Conclusion\n\nDracula Protocol is a fully automized yield aggregator and booster that actively pursues multiple strategies and mechanisms to ensure market-beating returns and ease of use for its users:\n\n* One single user interface\n* Multiple yield farming options\n* Full automization\n* Near total gas fee elimination\n* Whale dominance in pools\n* Daily profit compouding\n* Additional interest earnings\n\nProfits are payed out in the form of $ETH or $DRC, a non-inflationary token bought up from open markets, ensuring constant buying pressure.\n\nDracula Subreddit: r/Draculaprotocol",

Also best support hands down, a lot of people won't use an exchange where they take 2 months to reply or ignore you completely, cm replies within 50sec or 4min at most via live chat.\n\n\nAnd about the exchange\n\n* Instant fiat on and off ramps\n\n* fully compliant and regulated, unlike binance/kucoin they won't shut down or keep your funds in limbo\n\n* 24/7 support that replies within 50 seconds\n\n* one of the only good Tokenized security platforms. This is big, STO's could potentially be big\n\n* copy trading \n\n* working margin trading even for USA, also lowest margin fees \n\n* one cool thing is they don't charge for listings, they only want good projects on their exchange whom they can work with etc, so instead of asking for a million to list, they pick promising projects, so no scams or sh*tcoins\n\nonly problem is low liquidity because none of you guys talk about it here",

One of the most attractive features for investors is the fact that 90% of all transaction and trading fees on Switcheo TradeHub are paid out to the SWTH stakers on the platform. If you own and stake SWTH, then not only do you participate in governance, you also participate in the income generated on the blockchain. The remaining 10% of fees are put in a software development fund (SDF) for funding of ecosystem projects approved by the community via governance vote.\n\nActual trading takes place on Switcheo TradeHub via Demex - the UI/dapp for trading. Other projects such as Zilswap which was built by Switcheo Labs is also scheduled to be migrated to Switcheo TradeHub. This will naturally increase transaction volume on Swithcheo TradeHub as well as expand the ecosystem further.\n\nIn summary, by purchasing SWTH, you can own a piece of the revenue generated by Switcheo TradeHub for as long as you stake. Current apr is around 37%, and the passive income potential as trading fees increase have the potential to become lifechanging. Stakers are distributed 90% of all of the transaction and trading fees generated on Switcheo TradeHub. Blockchain transaction fees are rewarded in SWTH, and trading fees are rewarded in the form of the traded pairs. Wouldn't it be nice to earn BTC, ETH, BNB, et. al. by just staking SWTH? Yes, I thought that might get your attention. :-D\n\nFor additional information, visit the Switcheo TradeHub official Telegram channel, and take a deeper dive into a thriving project in the Cosmos ecosystem, and fear not, you're not too late. Currently SWTH trades around .078 per token, and the entire project has a market cap of less than $125m. This is for a project with a launched, working mainnet and a solid development team and mature, stable community.\n\nP.S. Switcheo TradeHub is a very unique project. The SWTH token not only powers the Switcheo Blockchain but also the trading app, DEMEX. You will need to create a TradeHub wallet first before purchasing SWTH on Demex. Yes, ledgers work on Switcheo TradeHub. :-D",

This means that from March 25th the available amount of CRO will decrease faster and faster.\n\n**6.**\n\nThe price increase in march bring even more buyers to the market, so in my opinion CRO will be in the top 10 within 2 weeks\n\n(in the last two weeks it has already risen from 40th to 20th place)\n\n**7.**\n\n The team at Crypto(dot)com is a real company with the intent to bring the cryptoworld to the mass and that's what they work on every day. This means that CRO is almost the only coin that will survive for years, while 99% of all crypto projects will disappear over time \n\n **Conclusion:**\n\nI have my largest crypto position in CRO for March and I keep that up to $1.56 because i think it will never fall below $1 again after march \n\n That is my opinion and no financial advice. What you do with the information is up to you. But i think CRO is the better BNB what do you think? \n\n \\-If you want to read more opinions about different coins from me in the future, please leave an upvote -",

With  full backing from the Government, the Sharia-compliant platform enables  Indonesia\u2019s predominantly Islamic population to manage their wealth,  trade, save and transact in the debt and interest-free gold bullion via  mobile device.\n\nThe nationwide reach of the government-run postal service, PT Pos, opens up **the shariah-compliant, economic stability of physical gold**  to the entire population of Indonesia, including unbanked and  underbanked communities. As the largest non-bank institution in  Indonesia, PT Pos is positioned to offer the Indonesian population  financial access through 24,000 physical service locations across the  country.  \n\nThrough integrating the Kinesis  technology and monetary system, the PosGO Syariah app provides  Indonesian citizens with \u2018PosGold\u201d, a digitalised physical gold trading  platform and \u2018Switch\u2019 for real-time peer-to-peer transfers of both gold  and fiat balances. The platform also offers \u2018Pos Pay\u2019 a payment gateway  and E-Wallet service and \u2018Gold To Mecca\u2019 a gold-based community savings  program for Hajj and Umrah pilgrimage trips. \n\nThis partnership between PT Pos, Kinesis, ABX, ICDX and PT Bullion Ecosystem International is **one of the largest public-private partnerships in economic history**.\n\n**The platform is live**  and being rolled out firstly to PT POS\u2019s 45,000 employees. In  subsequent months, the platform will be rolled out nationwide across  Indonesia.\n\nKey representatives, including  the President Director of PT POS and top government officials, will  present the mobile application along with the vision for Indonesian  financial services at a press conference on **May 21st 2021**. \n\n**PT POS Corporate Spokesman said:** *\u201cPosGo  Syariah is a large ecosystem that integrates many parties to be able to  actively conduct trade, business, service, utility, financial  transactions as well as an ecosystem that integrates the supervisory  work processes of all regulatory agencies in Indonesia with the aim of  improving the quality of protection for the community as consumers and  forming a systematic solution ecosystem for a better community life.\u201d*\n\n**Thomas Coughlin, Chief Executive Officer of Kinesis, said:** *\u201cThis  a pivotal moment in the Kinesis journey. We are proud to be working  with the Indonesian national government and all the partners involved in  this momentous project. People are increasingly moving away from  traditional currencies and I am humbled to present Kinesis as a robust  and scalable solution for digitalised and mobilised gold as a currency.* \n\n*\u201cCrucially, this project  shows just how the Kinesis technology can be applied in the real world  at a national level. Through public-private partnerships, which are a  core part of our DNA and driver for innovation, we will continue to work  with nations across the world to deliver viable solutions for the  transformation of an outdated monetary system.\u201d*",

Their gold stablecoin, the KAU (1g gold) is on a Stellar blockchain allocated 1:1... the main reason this feature is sharia compliant is that there is no interest charged or earned.  Kinesis does pay a yield though, and this is done by charging users fees (\\~0.22%) and this fills a master fee pool.  Yields of various kinds are paid to users out of this master fee pool, and this satisfies sharia banking / investing philosophy.\n\nKinesis has a lot planned in the coming few months, and additional partnerships have been mentioned, but with whom has not been released.\n\nThese guys are a big deal, and too much to describe here without sharing links, but they aren't allowed on this subreddit.",

With this in mind, he can use DEXs and then focus on stacking and preserving funds in stable coins like USDC or USDT.  Better yet, stake those stable coins to earn a better return than in some bank account.  He'll keep his funds in crypto and outside of the traditional financial system while shielding them from volatility.  Over time, more options for him to transfer to legacy financial markets will present themselves if he really thinks there is a need to do so.",

            "text": "I first got into Cardano during the bull run of 2017. Yep, I came in at the top of the market, bought at the top of the market, and watched it all go to hell when it dropped to .03 per ADA. Following the old adage \"buy when the streets are running red with blood\" I took what little capital I had left and started buying ADA at .03. Eventually I was able to accumulate around 35k ADA. \n\nThen began the long crypto winter preceding the current bull run. Things got worse for me financially and eventually I had to declare bankruptcy due to some other unfortunate and non-crypto related financial decisions. I cashed out the 35k ADA I had to pay the retainer for my bankruptcy attorney. I was done with crypto and didn't pay attention to it again until a few months ago.\n\nImagine my shock and horror when I saw ADA had pushed past $1.00! If only I had held my ADA I would have about $35,000.00 dollars worth! Now I know that is not a lot of money to many people, but for me it would have been life changing. I wouldn't have had to declare bankruptcy anyway. The fact my ADA went to pay my bankruptcy attorney still smarts to this day.\n\nToday I am doing better financially and have been able to re-invest a small amount of disposable capital in the crypto markets. My portfolio is almost an even split between BTC and ADA. I tell this story to prove that I was there and am speaking from experience. I have been involved in the Cardano Community and followed Cardano for about 4 years. You will not find a project more theoretically or financially sound than Cardano.\n\nIf you are currently holding Cardano, or thinking about buying Cardano, HOLD ON TIGHT and don't let it go if you can do so. I never thought Cardano would hit surpass $1.00 again and it did. The project has the soundest fundamentals of any other crypto out there. Its potential to impact society and its holders bank accounts in a positive way is unlimited.\n\nI know there are a few that will get a chuckle out of my messed up story. Go ahead and take your shots. But for those that are thinking about buying some ADA, jump on board. It has already made millionaires and will continue to do well into the next decade. Don't be me and hold onto that ADA for dear life!",

It drives away investors.\nWe need things that can give investors and incentive to put money into the company even if it\u2019s a small implementation. E-money is on the smaller side of crypto companies but is still backed up by already existing and established currencies (Euro, Swiss Franc, Swedish Krona, Norwegian Krone, and Danish Krone). It also has audits from external auditing firms, so that definitely brings more trust to the coin.\n\nIt\u2019s idea like these that make investors more trustful in the market.

Save time. Prevent emotional gambling.\n* **How:** Use AI & ML technology  \n\n\nCreating a **profitable trading bot** in crypto is extremely hard. And that's normal since analytical trading and algorithms that use it are pretty much pointless. You can't tame the **volatility of Bitcoin (BTC)** and other alts by using Forex indicators.\n\nBut what you can do is fight fire with fire. Or in our case, **fight technology** with another **technology**. **Artificial intelligence** and **machine learning** are making an impact on countless industries already. ***And they may turn out to be the key to profiting in crypto.***\n\nRelated: [Interview with the brain behind One Button's AI/ML trading bots.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4ewR6Nm0Yo)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Success:**\n\n*119,409 days of real-life trading time later. Add a couple of thousands of investors' accounts, and here is what we can say about the platform:*\n\n* proven to protect your portfolio during bear runs. **Source:** [Twitter](https://twitter.com/onebuttontrade/status/1485985448640286722)\n* can outperform BTC and ETH over long periods. **Source:**  [Medium](https://medium.com/onebuttontrade/the-66-days-bitcoin-experiment-85633181fd63)\n* \\+40% against **Bitcoin** alone in the last 6 months. **Source:** [Medium](https://medium.com/onebuttontrade/one-button-becomes-invite-only-c3f248850716)\n* tracked over 187 case studies in the previous year. **See** [35 case studies of BTC vs AI.](https://medium.com/onebuttontrade/35-case-studies-of-bitcoin-vs-ai-ml-trading-bots-e87fc5404a0e)\n* backed up by over **12,000 investors** and seasoned **crypto-traders**\n\nA total of 8 AI trading bots made it into the final roster for public use. Many more were discharged or left for future development.  \n \n\nBut the ones that made it out to the all-stars team are something else. Instead of going with their technical names, the team decided to give them a playful spin.  \n\n\nHorizon, Performer, Astral, Clipper... are just a few of the wacky names that these **trading bots** have (their images are even sweeter). But don't let their appearance fool you - these machines are designed to kill. Oooor at least to **beat the crap out of the market** when opportunities occur.  \n \n\n**Shutting Down:**\n\n*The small dream of creating a profitable crypto trading bot turned into a big company in less than a year. At its peak, the total assets under management reached $14.000.000, and that's just from a handful of users.*  \n \n\n***But now the dream is moving in a new direction...***  \n\n\n* registrations are **closing down** (to get in, you'll need to be invited)\n* a lighter app will be released next month (**100% automation**)\n* Binance Futures bot is in the final testing phase (**shorting bots** are arriving)\n* Two limited **lifetime subscription plans\\*** are available (infinite access to everything) \n\nAnd probably a lot more is cooking in the backend from the Internet entrepreneurs.\n\n \n\n**What does this mean for you:**\n\nRegistrations are free until the end of the week. You may be an experienced trader, a crypto rookie, or a non-believer. But in exchange for your email, you can **lock** your spot on the app forever.  \n \n\nIf you happen to love your test drive and feel the need for getting more bot slots, you can always upgrade your plan. In either case, you'll get invited to a Discord server where you can exchange ideas with other well-minded crypto enthusiasts.   \n \n\n**\\*Disclaimer about the lifetime subscription plans:**\n\nSpending a lot of money on trading software should be thought out thoroughly. Since creating a FOMO in crypto has been shown to produce more negatives, the OB team decided to give a 90 days warranty to the two packages to prevent bad decisions.  \n \n\n***If your bots underperform the market over the next 3 months, you'll get your money back.***  \n\n\n**Closing thoughts:**  \n \n\nStay safe, trade mindfully, and if you happen to use any trading software make sure to do good research on the project before buying anything.",

You only need a compatible wallet to actually see the token, you can still send the tokens to your address, even if they do not show up in your wallet app they are on.\n\nA compatible wallet is MyEtherWallet (https://www.myetherwallet.com/ - Always check this link VERY carefully, a lot of scams/phising with MEW going on), but I'd suggest you to get a Ledger Nano S (https://www.ledgerwallet.com/), a pretty secure way to store most of your Crypto that narrows possible attack vectors greatly.\n\nNow, for any currency with their own Blockchain, you need a compatible wallet. BTC/LTC to name a few. The Ledger can hold a couple of them, a lot of other crypto have their own wallets, mostly based around Electrum (https://electrum.org/#home)\n\nI would advise against keeping such software on your online PC, as it is pretty dangerous as a lot of malware is around that tries to snoop your keys.",

I used RH about a year ago just to get into small stock trading, but beginning of this year I wanted to get into cryptocurrency! I downloaded \"Uphold\" and it let me start buying right away using only my debit card/checking account, which was nice. I've only bought around $20-$50 each of ETH, ADA, Nano, and XRP (trying to have a diversified portfolio) but I 100% definitely plan on adding around $200 from each of my checks into crypto, especially as I do more DD/research about each of them. My biggest concern is how everyone says \"Not your keys, not your coins\" what does that mean per se? I'm definitely investing for the long term, hoping to at least stick with 2 coins for 5+ years and just play with the others. Hoping to add hundreds of dollars each week until I have a decent amount invested overall (around $15k+) and was just concerned about, over the course of 5+ years, would Uphold just suddenly say \"not your coins anymore bucko!\" And not let me sell them for profit?? Really couldn't see that happening. \n\nIs having an actual \"wallet\" that much more secure? Also heard of fees being out the ass for transferring them over (especially for ETH (gas?) which is a currency I'm wanting to ride out long-term) would it be worth it to transfer what little bit I have now (say, ~$40ish for each crypto) into a wallet so that they're MINE?? Or wait until I have thousands into them and transfer them then? \n\nExcuse my ignorance if this has been posted/asked before, just wanting to make sure what im about to invest, can't just be taken away (crypto all falling to $0 is completely different since I knew the risks involved) but if a wallet is what i really need, instead of keeping all my coins in Uphold, what wallets are preferred? For long-term that is...thanks to anyone who can help!",

There is risk in transferring to your wallet, there's no refund or sorting it out if it goes wrong, it's gone.

It\u2019s been a little over a week since then and we are now ready to open the group up to the public.\n\nIt's so frustrating in some of those coins' chats, FUDders do systematic work and a lot of useless bots and trolls are always around, making it often impossible to have a decent conversation over interesting topics related to the project you're interested in.\n\nI encourage all of you hodlers of any alt-coin and especially those active in those communities, to demand projects' teams to follow the example and make a dedicated community for their investors, bigger and smaller (here they started with 1000 OGN to get in, quite fair as it's not too prohibitive for most of the people, but not even too few so that literally anyone could get in just to troll etc.)\n\nI am curious to know if this sentiment is spread among you all fellow crypto holders.\n\nHere is [the full article](https://blog.originprotocol.com/introducing-a-community-for-verified-ogn-token-holders-82f3307648c) if interested.",

Download Ledger Live, then install the applications for the specific cryptocurrencies you purchased onto your Ledger and make an account for these on Ledger Live.  \n\nFor cryptocurrencies not yet supported by Ledger Live, you will need to download a specific wallet for each crypto- for example, Yoroi wallet works with Cardano.  These won't be directly visible in your Ledger, but you can set up the wallet with Ledger before you add funds.  If you go to Ledger's site and search for each asset, it should list compatible wallets.\n\nOh, and send a small test transaction before moving large sums.  It's best to use the whitelist feature on exchanges here- this way, your wallet addresses are saved and you don't make a transcription error and lose all your funds.\n\nHope this helps!",

I entered $250 on the Dogecoin keypad and I clicked buy. suddenly I saw that my Crypto wallet has 800,000 coins for a value of $25000, 3 cents/DOG 2 weeks ago. I panicked, I did not authorize this transaction, there was no way to cancel it. I didn't know what to do so I sold all the Dodge for a value of $24150. That is an $850 loss. I do not have the money in the bank, thus the transaction was declined by my bank. Yesterday I was surprised that the USD wallet has $24150 and my DOGE wallet is negative  800,000 coins for a value of negative $60,000 the difference on the account is negative $35000. How is that, I was not able to cancel the transaction, I did not want to keep the 800,000 DOGE since I did not buy $25000, I wanted to buy $250. I am afraid, I haven't slept in 2 weeks and suicide crossed my mind :( I have been reaching out to the app for 2 weeks in every way possible explaining what happened and I am receiving to response at all. I don't know what to do. I emailed  them right away when it happened and I only wanted to cancel the transaction, thus I sold the coins. I have never worked with crypto before and i am a student. If the value of the DOGE goes up I will end up with a potentially negative 1 million dollars + balance. My life is ruined and I have no one to talk to. I am scared.",

I understand completely how transactions on the blockchain can be tracked on a transaction-level simply by examining where (other wallets) the transactions come from and go to.\n\nHowever, let's say that .gov is coming after me for having an American flag waving from the cab of my Mac truck as I drive across the US.  I've bought or been gifted $BTC via an intermediary like Coinbase (boo) or [Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com), then transferred those funds into a software or hardware wallet off-net. Yes, there's a trail of where those assets went; however, without a good key/password, how exactly do those funds not sitting vulnerably at an intermediary get \"seized\"?\n\nAs a side note, feel free to tell me how a transaction-based mechanism like the blockchain is anonymous as relates to funds and where they go; Yes, I understand my name isn't on my wallet, but the funds are 100% trackable and current location (wallet) \\*is\\* known.\n\nThanks, and I appreciate any input, black helicopter or legit.\n\nSteve",

By providing testimonials and creating a network of seemingly authentic accounts, the network pushes users to forex trader accounts, and the second part which ultimately aims to get them off-platform and to deposit money into one of their accounts.\u00a0\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s financial watchdog, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) has actively warned against these fraudulent cryptocurrency exchanges, issuing two warnings this year.\u00a0\n\nEarlier this year, the South African cricket team was victim to a Twitter scam, which resulted in the team offering a fake Bitcoin lottery to its followers. The tweet which claimed CSA had partnered with crypto wallet Luno was active for around five hours, and resulted in a number of Twitter users entering the non-existent lottery.\u00a0\n\nOf course, South Africa isn\u2019t the only country to be home to crypto scams. Last year a number of Twitter accounts posing as Elon Musk stole money from users, with one account reportedly promising to give out Bitcoin to participants, and earning up to $170,000 from the scam.\u00a0\n\nGoogle too, has been victim to Twitter hackers, with the official G Suite account offering a fake crypto giveaway, and misleading users who believed Google now offered crypto payments.\u00a0\n\nIt is clear that the number of crypto scams circulating have no intention of halting any time soon. Bitcoin scams are particularly problematic on Twitter, and the CEO Jack Dorsey has\u00a0said\u00a0that Twitter would be cracking down on cryptocurrency spam accounts. Nonetheless, scammers are becoming adept at navigating these controls, and the responsibility is increasingly up to the individual to be able to spot and avoid Bitcoin scams.",

I thought it was a good idea and want to set up some thing with reoccurring purchase and just forget about it. Nothing big. Just like $5 a week, set it and forget it for the next 10 years. I was thinking ADA. Is it a bad idea? Good idea? Needs improvement?",

As a store of value it's better suited than anything else, and that's what you need to do this.\n\nI was rather pleased with the result of the investment plan we took out when we had our baby, a similar investment level gave him a deposit to buy his first home 20 years on. That same level invested in BTC for 20 years would easily buy the house outright. It's a splendid idea, even if you only give the kid half....",

For simplicity we could just look at bitcoin. Their value in dollars would be increasing every day, making it very difficult to actually understand what you actually have in your wallets?\n\nUsually in times of crisis, people look elsewhere for trading/exchanging. Of course that could be crypto. But how would we determine how much to pay for a bread, a meal, a week worth of shopping, a house?\n\nI am a bit confused about what to think about this. Usually governments take on the role of \"managing\" this somehow, even if in disastrous ways. But how can decentralized markets take on this role of fixing crypto's worth to something....tangible?\n\nOr am I totally looking at this in a wrong way?",

I looked into doing the same thing with crypto exchanges, similar to what you did, and calculated that [wise.com](https://wise.com) rates were better. The main problem, as already stated by another commenter, is the transfer from crypto to fiat at the far end. I fully expect that someday in the near future wise will move to crypto rails and become even cheaper, or a crypto rail solution will be developed to put wise out of business (the Jack Maller guy mentioned putting transferwise out of business \"later\" in his Ecuador speech).  \n\n\nPost: https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/pc0jag/comment/hag8nta/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3",

Obviously, DeFi is the financial system of the future. Here is what I suggest, include coins that would teach them the different aspects of the financial institution. For example a coin like **$BMI** for decentralized insurance would not only teach the kid about insurance, they would also get to learn about insurance with respect to DeFi. They would also learn about staking. So, I suggest you always consider the project. Encourage the kid to read about the coins, explain the whitepapers to them.

            "text": "Hi,\n\nI have a few questions. There are some things I don\u2019t really understand about TrustWallet and crypto. I will go straight to the point:\n\nFirst - I used Trust Wallet, connected to PancakeSwap, to buy some low cap, new coins (or tokens). \n\n- Some of those don\u2019t show balance in the Trust Wallet (even after I added them, even if I can see how many I own). Why? Scams?\n\n- I asked that question to the \u201cadmin\u201d of one of those, via Telegram (PrinceFloki). He asked me to send him my wallet address. I refused since I have no clue on how that information can be used against me. Can they used it to scam me, hack me, or any other form of bad thing? Is it unsafe to share wallet address?\n\n- After I refused he said this :\u201dThat\u2019s because there\u2019s a problem with your in-node strings and you have to correct it through secured wallet protocol\u201d. No clue if this is true. Not even sure what it means.\n\n- Concerning another token, Dogekongzilla, being a reward token, it requires me to connect my wallet to their dashboard in order to claim my rewards for holding. Is it unsafe to connect Trust Wallet to third party webapps? What could happen?\n\n (Link:  https://app.dogekongzilla.com/?_ga=2.66350574.1742041288.1636236946-1816422710.1636236946#/ ) \n\n- There is a website claiming to launch a new reward token (Sharp Token) in a few weeks and they pretend to make \u201cpresales\u201d. Apparently I can send BNB to an address they show. I tried with like 1$ worth of BNB and indeed received the tokens. Is that a scam? Are presales a real thing in crypto?\n\nPlease help me out. I\u2019m just experiencing with some 5-10$ to understand how the abyss of crypto works. I\u2019ve heard many stories about people getting hacked or scammed so I rather be careful.\n\n\nThank you !",

I held onto the BTC until it dropped to about NZ$960 at which point I decided to trade it for SHIB.\n\nI used Exodus' exchange feature to trade my NZ$960 BTC to NZ$840 worth of SHIB.\n\nI lost about NZ$120 to the exchange.\n\nMy problem:\n\nSince then my SHIB value has gone up to about NZ$1500.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot use my EasyCrypto to sell this SHIB, so I tried to use my wallet to exchange SHIB back to BTC, but this is where I encountered a road block. The wallet is informing me that I need (roughly) NZ$200 worth of ETH for this transaction!\n\nNot only that, but I would lose about NZ$150 in the conversion too!\n\nSo my NZ$1500 worth of SHIB would get me only NZ$1150 worth of BTC.\n\nIs there a better way for me to get NZD out of this?

Anything you do with an ERC20 token like Shib is going to cost you a fortune in gas fees. Your best better is to find an exchange that you can move it to, once you have enough ETH and sell it on the exchange, then buy something like XRP, XLM or ALGO depending on what EasyCrypto can handle and transfer that and sell it for your NZD. You will still pay gas fees to move it, but save the swap fees, and who knows, maybe it will go up more while you are setting this all up.\n\nEdit: I mention XRP, XLM and ALGO as they are all really cheap to transfer and commonly supported by a lot of crypto places but you could use anything with cheap transfer fees.",

            "text": "I am just beginning to learn about crypto, and I was scammed, because I invested in scam coins without research, just because the names sounded great. This got me motivated to learn about how scam coins work on the inside, their tactics and how they do things, to understand everything about it fully inside and out, not only their general tactics, but even how they make these scams, the details. I also always loved learning the ins and outs of things like ponzi schemes, MLM's as a child, and scammers always fascinated me, I want to learn everything about how scam coins work. I got some basic info from some videos, but i still have a few questions about them in general.\n\nFirst, some general questions :\n\n1 - I noticed many scammers use [cointool.app](https://cointool.app/) to create their coins as it's very easy to do so, and they give options for developers to be able to burn tokens, mint them, blacklist users, be deflationary, pause the coin, but I wonder, is there a way to see if a token can be minted, if it can be blacklisted, burned, is deflationary, etc if you're just an investor looking to buy it? Is there anywhere the holders or just regular people can look to see if a coin is any of the things I listed, or is it up to the creator to disclose that?\n\n2 - In general, scam or not, can regular people who want to buy the coin, or hold it see the creator's wallet, how much and to whom that wallet sent crypto? If so, how?\n\nQuestions specifically about the inner workings of scams\n\nA - As i mentioned before scammers usually use cointool to create coins, and many of them use a batch wallet generator feature in order to not make it not so obvious that it's a scam by not holding all their coins in one wallet, but make hundreds of wallets and send them the tokens, and then slowly bleed out liquidity out of those wallets. How do they make hundreds of wallets sell liquidity at the same time? What program do they use?\n\nB - What tactics do scammers use to slowly bleed out liquidity, how much do they sell usually in order to slowly get rid of their coins? Do they sell 1-2% of their total holdings per week?\n\nC - What if they decide to do a hard rug pull instead of a soft one, and want to dump trillions of tokens to cash out at once. Would that be possible for every scammer? Would that be possible even if there are not enough buyers for the coin, would that be possible in crypto specifically? Since I beleive that isn't possible in the stock market, would that be possible in crypto, is crypto structured differently?\n\nD - What if the scammer had 1T tokens worth 1MUSD, if it was possible for them to sell it all at once, and they decided to do it and sell all their coins in one instant, would they walk away with 1MUSD, or like 500kUSD because they crashed the market?\n\nE - I know that many scammers buy fake twitter comments, youtube comments, reddit posts. How do these fake tweets and yt comments usually go? Do the comments usually go like : \"Buy $SAFEMOON?\" How do the fake reddit posts usually go? How are they structured text-wise, what do they say? Is there an example for fake reddit posts promoting a scam coin?\n\nF - I also know many scammers have official twitter, reddit accounts, where they themselves post. Is there a difference between how legit projects tweet or post or how scam projects tweet or post? How do the tweets, reddit posts, usually look from an official account of a scam coin? Like how are they structured, text wise? Do they say \"hey, look at us, up 100%, buy now!\", or is there like a way they are usually structured?",

The biggest advantage is in case one gets compromised for some reason the rest of your assets are safe. It also makes it harder for anyone to track your wealth as it's spread across wallets. It can be annoying if you need to make a purchase that is bigger than what you have in a single wallet but I don't think this is an issue at the moment for most people. But that should be easy to overcome as long as you are not on the ETH network and have to pay huge fees for every transaction. I think it all depends on how much you have and how you want to split things. For now I use 3-4 different wallets, excluding exchanges.",

I have spoken to a lot of my friends about this and a few of them have made some real profits (6 figure, but also got in as early as 2013), they have been advising I play around with NFT's but considering all the 's\\*\\*t coins' on there, I think I'm more suited for coins backed by real projects - I think that's the more secure and intelligent approach, but what do I know.\n\nFirst off, I hear Binance and Bittrex are good platforms to trade on - is that still the case? Also i am aware that I need to find an offline wallet that can securely protect my soon to-be coins, any recommendations as to good/trustworthy/cost efficient ways to do this? I am sure there is so much more that I should be aware of, but hopefully that will come with time and experience. So essentially what I'm asking is (in metaphorical terms) ; can you show me how to walk, so I can learn to run on my own?\n\nLooking forward to being a part of this subreddit!\n\nHappy Hodlingdays!",

What's the best way in your opinion to safely get your metal seed phrase through customs/airport security without it been compromised or taken? Hardware wallets devices w/e can be replaced but generally there isn't a concern about that. The seed phase is the concern here.\n\nIf you are using a CryptoSteel capsule or a product that enables the words to be disassembled; You can remove all the words off it put it in your checked in luggage NOT carry on risk of it been taken & keep your phrase during transit on a carry on written in a book or piece of paper, then reassemble it later.\n\nHowever engraved metal seed phrases on plated sheets are problematic here, can possible be seen on the x ray or so what is your best advise on the matter? You obviously want to ensure your seed phrase is kept with you at all times so carried on with you; It is considerably risky to put it in your check in luggage the crap that goes in the cargo hold. What if there is a chance your luggage goes missing or is x-ray without you noticing your keys can be compromised.  There is a good risk of customs/security seizing your metal plate with your seed phrase on it, during the security checkpoints.\n\nYou'd only should have to take your metal seed phrase through customs/airport security if you are  emigrating. Some people are going to encounter this issue, regardless needs to be addressed. Thoughts?",

If you look at the statistics of last month (August), 77% of OpenSea NFT sales were for less than 100 dollars.\n\nTo be frank, with its low gas fees, I would say this is auspicious and hopeful for NFT accessibility. Plus, mentioning trading volume in on the said marketplace reached an all-time high of 51.7 million dollars. 190,000 wallets have bought or sold an NFT on this platform. However 14.5% of the wallets traded on this network also traded on OpenSea (ETH mainnet) while the major 85.5% only transacted on the Polygon variant of OpenSea. \n\nIn principal, the top OpenSea projects are Zed Run with 29,000 ETH trading volume, MyCryptoHeroes with 27,000 Eth trading volume, and at last, Decentraland Wearables with 22,600 Eth trading volume. \n\nI guess Polygon (MATIC) will stay on the offense for the next period.

            "text": "**TL;DR**: Your coins aren't safe if you don't continuously keep multiple secure/encrypted backups of your keys in separate locations.\n\n--------\n\nWhen people discuss crypto security, they usually focus only on securing against attacks. However, it is **equally important to secure your coins against recovery failure**.\n\nIf you only store your keys on a single device, you will eventually lose your coins. Even storing your key on 2 devices is not always sufficient due to geographical disasters.\n\nBy \"**key**\", I mean anything that is used to access to your coins, including: account password, seed phrase, recovery/backup code, hardware token, hardware key, 2-factor authenticator app, 2-factor authenticator generator, email account, smartphone, password safe master password, etc.\n\nNo device lasts forever. Smartphones typically last 2-5 years while computers can last 5-15 years. What this means is that over the many decades of your lifetime, you are guaranteed to lose copies of keys stored on software media multiple times. Digital hardware tokens typically only last 2-10 years. For non-electric hardware keys (the $100-200+ ones), it's quite difficult to not lose or misplace one over 30+ years, especially if you relocate homes often.\n\n**Here's a basic disaster recovery checklist** (both private wallet & custodial):\n\n- Do you have an encrypted backup of your keys if the device that normally stores them (computer, smartphone, storage media, security device, etc.) is lost or permanently fails?\n- If you end up losing multiple devices simultaneously in a single location (fire, flood, bad luck), can you still recover your wallet?\n- Do you have a standard operating procedure for duplicating all your keys to the replacement backup in a timely manner once the original backup fails?\n- People sometimes use old, unused devices for backups, but this is dangerous because old devices fail more often, especially when they're unused.\n- If you're memorizing passwords and recovery keys in your head, do you trust that your memory will still be good when you get old?\n- Occasionally simulate a mock disaster recovery to make sure your backups still work and that you remember how to use them.\n\n**If you have a private wallet**:\n\n- Have you looked up what's required to recover your wallet? This is usually the seed phrase + basic info about the type of wallet.\n- If someone accidentally discovers your hardware key, can they easily brute force the key on every popular wallet until they find one that accepts the key?\n- If you use a hardware key, do you have encrypted offline digital backups in case you lose it or if it's damaged enough to become unreadable? (Also, be careful of clipboard managers and text loggers since they can keep track of what you type or copy-paste.)\n\n**If you store your coins on a centralized exchange**:\n\n- Most accounts also require access to an email address or smartphone for additional verification. If you lose access to those, are you still able to recover?\n- Alternatively, have you gone through Know Your Client (KYC)? Many centralized platforms have a method of allowing you to recover your account if you can sufficiently prove you are the owner via KYC identification. However, this can take months since support will need to wait to be certain that no one else can claim to be you.\n- Centralized crypto platforms are NOT traditional financial institutes and can take forever to recover your account. The Coinbase subreddit is a giant wall of customer support requests of people waiting weeks to months with no support. CeFi lending platforms tend to be faster with customer support, but it's hit or miss, and recovery requests tend to take the longest.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nFor private wallets and DeFi platforms, a **Dead Man Switch** is the best solution when you can't completely trust that your beneficiary won't run off with your wallet. If you haven't set up a dead man switch, your coins are as good as burned when you die. [Google Inactive Account Manager](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3036546?hl=en) can be used as a basic DMS.\n\nAlso make sure your dead man switch isn't sufficient by itself to give access to the account. Otherwise, the custodian of the switch can also steal your wallet. You can do that by splitting your key into multiple parts.\n\nFor centralized platforms, it's a mixed bag. Some platforms like BlockFi allow you to submit a beneficiary list by form, but other platforms like Coinbase and Celsius Network don't offer direct beneficiary services. Your relatives would have to contact their support and go through probate after your death. Platforms like Binance and Nexo have no support for beneficiaries.",

The digital coin is slated to launch later this year.\n\nStock Watch: Facebook stock slipped 0.84% on Wednesday. It was a mixed day for crypto prices as well.\n\nFinal Thoughts: For Facebook, there are some questions about how it expects to profit from crypto. But for the crypto world, Facebook\u2019s entrance adds some much-needed legitimacy to the space.\n\nHope you enjoyed this commentary.

Can you ever get scammed just by \u2018approving\u2019 the sale of a token, or by sending it to another wallet (but not interacting with the contract itself).\n\n2. If I engage with a scam contract, let\u2019s say one that sweeps all the tokens from your account - are other wallet addresses on the same device secure? I.e. Trezor gives you multiple addresses all on the same wallet, can they sweep those too?\n\n3. If I engage with a scam contract on one platform - say BSC, can they also sweep my tokens on another network - like on the ETH or MATIC networks?\n\n4. If malware is installed on my machine, and it captures my password, can it also work out my private key and steal funds when I connect my hardware device?\n\n5. There are sites like keys.lol which list every private key in existence but state the odds are impossibly small to being found. If I have a key + pass phrase is my private key technically also on there?\n\n6. Any other tips for staying safe?\n\nThanks!",

            "text": "\n\nDue to the introduction of blockchain, virtual gaming has completely been reformed, it has become more enjoyable, rewarding and worthwhile, the possibilities of blockchain gaming is quite unlimited.\nSeascape network is massively buoying the patronage of virtual gaming and bridging the big gap existing between gaming and decentralized finance.\n\n**SEASCAPE FOSTERS INTEROPERABILITY VIA ETHERUM, BSC AND OTHER CHAINS.**\n\nEtherum is the most popular blockchain network of the digital era, it has been a long standing support structure and basis for most of the digital currencies we are enjoying today as well as several decentralized applications. The Seascape network utilizes this innovative technology due to its capacity and effectiveness, etherum infrastructure is quite scalable, cost effective, fast, and guarantees high throughput and transaction finality.\n\nBeing the major support structure for Seascape network is a big win for this project in that the idea of DeFi gamefied which entails incorporating decentralized finance into gaming so that gamers can maximize their experience, together with the Binanace smart chain network, seascape intends to connect other chains(interoperability), this will brings about an ecosystem where gamers can come together, share experiences, ideas,interact, play games and earn massively from their participation. \n\nIt is noteworthy that the seascape network proposes the integration of Polkadot blockchain infrastructure, one of the leading crypto/DeFi tools, this will further strengthen the network and ensure security of funds and users identity.\n\n**SUPPORT FOR NON FUNGIBLE TOKENS.**\n\nIn the crypto industry, NFTs are massively gaining popularity and seems a quite lucrative aspect of the industry. An NFT is a digital asset which represents real time assets like arts, music, in game items,gifs, collectibles, videos and many more which can be bought or traded online with crypto and as well are designed with the same underlying programming as digital tokens. These cyber assets are held and supported on various blockchains.\n\nNfts are extremely special and unique because they do not possess equal values and so cannot be replicated or exchanged, meaning that an Nft cannot be traded for another. Interestingly,the only way for NFTs to be sold is via the transfer of exclusive ownership rights from the seller to the buyer, this system will ensure complete transparency and as well provides consumers authenticity when verifying ownership of such assets.\n\nThe seascape network incorporates the non fungible token economy (nfts) in order to broaden its capacity, create dynamics and more opportunities for DeFi users, participants in the network can earn, purchase, invest or trade on nfts in a completely decentralized format. This implies that the network is not only restricted to crypto and game assets, Nfts being a huge component of the entire cryptocurrency industry will definitely boost the adoption of the seascape network.\n\n\n**CROWNS TOKEN DRIVES SYSTEM OPERATIONS.**\n\nCrowns was developed as the native digital currency of Seascape, it is the fuel that drives its operations, so to speak. With crowns, the privileges attached to the platform can be fully accessed by token holders among other things, however, below are some use cases for the crown token.\n\nCrowns can be utilized as a tool for rewards and incentives to active participants on the network, liquidity providers and gamers stand to earn this token for their continuous patronage and support towards the development of this inventive ecosystem.\n\nHolders of this token can choose to stake them for more rewards, this entails locking up the crown token in a compatible wallet for a specific period to strengthen the security of the network for more benefits.\n\nIssues regarding the network development can be handled by those who hold the crowns token, this implies that crowns is a governance tool as polls and decisions are easier conducted on chain with the token.\n\nYou can purchase and store crowns tokens for future benefits, it is a very lucrative cryptocurrency to invest on just so if you are looking for where to put your funds for massive benefits.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nSupport for Nfts is one of the chief features of the seascape platform, we all know how individuals like to try out new things and experiences, the non fungible token economy is gaining momentum in the crypto industry and as such will definitely pull massive adopters into the seascape network, while plans are underway for this network to generate its own native blockchain, Etherum and binance smart chain seem to have everything it takes to sustain Seascape.",

            "text": "Going through different subreddits each day I come across updates on different projects both new ones and the older ones that have been in the space for much longer, and somehow they all share something in common.. **\"passive rewards\"**.\n\nA lot of teams with the recent market turns are working to incentivise their projects and bring in tools from which holders can earn passive income and add more value to their holdings.\n\nFor a while now I've been staking my ALGO bags on Kucoin with APY around 15-20% at the start, currently way below that but that's still better than having them on my wallet. I've also got other coins staked on Binance, Bitfinex, name it, I would say I've fully explored the staking option on different defi coins.\n\nHowever there's one aspect of passive income that I'm yet to try out, and that is \"Liquidity Mining\" or \"Yield Farming\" as many people prefer to call it. This aspect of Defi allows users who provide liquidity for a particular token pair to be able to mine the token rewards using their Liquidity tokens as stake.\n\nI came across this option for SYLO few days ago and I've been working to learn more about how it works and the risks I need to consider before starting.\n\nFirst off one needs to provide liquidity for either SYLO-ETH or SYLO-wBTC pair on Uniswap, after which the liquidity tokens can be imported into the Sylo Smart Wallet from where the stake is made.\n\nGoing through the staking dashboard, APY for the SYLO/wBTC pair is currently around 150% while that for SYLO/ETH pair is about 107% and I can say those are way bigger than most of the pools I've been into recently, but that's also why I want to know if there's any major issue to consider.\n\nSo far it looks very legit to me and I'm willing to give it a try, but I want to know your thoughts on this as well. What are your concerns about Liquidity Mining and what APYs have you been getting from your stakes?\n\nFor those who might not know, Sylo is a decentralized network, protocol and communications Platform. It's Dapp, the Sylo smart wallet offers decentralized messaging, supports multi-chain crypto assets, supports NFTs, has payment options and also supports staking. With all these in place I think it's a pretty legit project that hasn't made it to the limelight just yet.",

It goes against all what crypto stands for.\n\nIn fact there are companies that solve problems like these with out using regulation. Companies like GPool are solving the aforementioned whale wallet problem by having zero tiers for example. And while decisions like this might be less profitable for the company, its the kind of action that makes the market a better space for everyone to trade in.\n\nRegulation is NEVER an answer here.

I can't help but think there must be a better/cheaper option.\n\nI have no problem paying the network fee. I have no problem paying a low/pro maker/taker/conversion fee. The issue I'm having occurs at these exchanges with deposits/withdrawals.\n\nI guess, what I'm looking for, if anyone has found out the best way to do it, is the cheapest way to get crypto directly from CAD to my wallet.\n\nMy assumption is that it will look something like being able to fund an exchange account for free, exchange or convert for free/maker/taker, and then withdrawal to a wallet and only pay the network fee.\n\nFor example, let's say I'm buying $500 worth of crypto.\n\nBitBuy, on deposit takes $7.50 (1.5%), then charges a maker/taker (.1%/.2%), then you pay the network fee on withdrawal.\n\nBinance, on deposit would take $10 (2%), then charge a maker/taker (.1/.1%), then you pay the network fee on withdrawal.\n\nCoinbase, on deposit would take $20 (4%), no exchange fee or conversion fee because you're directly buying BTC and they have the liquidity, then you pay the network fee on withdrawal.\n\nCoinsquare, you e-transfer in for free, then you pay a maker/taker (.1/.2%) to exchange, then you have to pay like $30 in fees to withdraw.\n\nI understand these guys need to make money, but I would think that there would be a way to make a simple trade and withdraw it to my wallet cheaper than $10. From what I've seen about Coinbase Pro in America, something like that I think would be ideal, but you can't directly fund for free your account with CAD.\n\nJust curious if anyone has already figured this out before I look into some more.",

I don't want to check my phone constantly due to FOMO so I think that's the best way.\n\nNow, my question is: According to what I read, using a wallet is preferable, and I should avoid keeping them in the exchange itself. So I set up a wallet. But when it was time to move my coins there, I see that binance has HUGE withdrawal fees in relation with the amounts I'm transferring (say, for some altcoins I might be getting $17 fees for moving around $300, which is ridiculous).\n\nSo I guess the question is, what's my best movement here? should I take the hit? just leave them in the exchange? is there something I'm missing?",

This is why I don\u2019t trust cryptocurrencies with big market caps, and absolutely no fundamentals whatsoever, or coins where the meme factory just kills its benefits, one dip and people will lose A LOT of money. I spend my time trying to predict which coins have solid fundamentals and blazing fast development rates. So I mainly focus on coins with low-medium market big market caps.

Or you could see EQO, the first cryptocurrency released by a public NASDAQ company. \n\nOr why not check out PhoenixDAO, who literally beat TicketMaster by releasing their events dApp where you can create NFT tickets that you can move to the dApp users, gift, or sell. \n\nFinally, there are healthy explosions in crypto, these are my favorite candidates for those types of explosions right now.

Yes...it is inflationary...but only 5 billion a cycle which as time goes on becomes more and more insignificant and is how fiat currencies work anyway. The true problem lies in the concentrations of doge. 90% is owned by just 1% of holders and of that the top 5 wallets I believe own 50% of all doge. The largest wallet of doge in existence has 38 billion doge...or around 28% of all doge. The reason this is a problem is if AT ANY TIME one of these whales decides to liquidate even a portion of their doge...it will saturate and crash the market. \n\nIt is exactly what Elon said needed to happen before he endorsed it is for the whales to liquidate. They never did and he promoted anyway and honestly I think this is a big out of touch joke to him. He is a billionaire and not like us in any way, shape or form and will do anything to remain that way. His money originally came from blood gold and other african mining operations from his family. Hes funny and intelligent and charismatic...but he is a billionaire and therefore the enemy quite frankly. He doesnt own any doge...his kids mine a bit of it but that's it. If and when a whale liquidated now it's going to burst the bubble that has formed and leave MILLIONS of bagholders. This causes 2 problems. \n\n1 it is going to turn millions of regular or willfully ignorant or otherwise petty people against all crypto as in \"oh doge is just like all other crypto so it's all a scam so I'm going to bad talk it and bully ppl who are into it and never invest again\" which is small minded and bad but honestly after being burned so bad can u blame the average person with no crypto education to think that. To 95% of these ppl they are woefully uneducated in crypto and think of it as a get rich quick scheme and nothing more. That ALREADY is unhealthy and if they get fucked over it will solidify that idea in their minds forever. 2...and this is the big one...doge is currently the 4th largest crypto in the world...worth more than many major household name companies. Anything I'll ng that's has 100 billion dollar valuation tanking is going to send shockwaves throughout the financial sector. When that happens there will inevitably be sanctions and regulations put into place to \"save ppl from themselves\" or from it happening again. This will effectively cripple all crypto immensely at first if not for quite awhile in quite a few places...especially the US. \n\nDoge is going to single handedly do more damage to the defi movement than any one thing ever has. It wont kill it but it's going to hurt...a lot. I'm happy some ppl are making life changing money and if human greed wasnt such an inevitable thing I'd say I trust the whales to only sell small(relatively) amounts at a time so as to not tank the whole system. And who knows maybe I'm too jaded and the whales wont be all that bad and this will literally turn into the ppls currency. But I'm 33 yrs old and have seen first hand what money and greed and power can do to a person...even someone u thought was bbn ur closest ally sell u to the wolves for a pretty penny. I trully believe this will end very badly...I hope it wont...but I sadly know better than to hope that. Here's to hoping I'm pleasantly wrong. All I can say to the average doge holder is take some profits here and there and dont spend more than u can afford...u know...financial fundamentals and what not. To the fanatics please stop shilling so loud...there are ppl dumping their life savings and rent and children's food money into this and when it does pop I see suicides and fallout on the way...thus expiditing the regulations to come. There is nothing wrong with investing...but doge is gambling at best and I hate to break it to u but there is nothing that just makes u rich without some form of consequences somewhere for someone...its not a good mentality for investing and getting rich is all well and good but nothing other than the government can just create money out of thin air...nothing. there is always a catch and that's a mentality that is only going to lead someone down a bad road and most likely lose everything u got at some point. Good luck and I love you...be safe.",

I\u2019ll update this list with more tips as I come across them.\n\n* **Keep your money in a wallet.** Avoid keeping it on the exchange unless you plan to actively trade with that money in the very near future. No exchange is hack-proof. Actually, nothing is hack-proof and anything is possible, especially where cryptocurrency is concerned.\n* **Keep your seed phrases and/or keystore file hidden and private.** When you set up your wallet(s), depending on the company you use, you are given a seed phrase, private key, and/or keystore file that is completely private and should not be shared with anyone. Write your wallet seed phrase down on several pieces of paper and store them in separate, safe places no one knows about. In case you are given a keystore file, upload it to a thumb drive or external hard drive and store for safekeeping.\n* **NEVER share your private key.** Anyone with access to your private key has access to your funds. Share your PUBLIC key, as this is what will be used to receive funds from external wallets. Anyone with your public address only has the ability to send money to your wallet.\n* When sending large amounts of money from a wallet to another wallet or to an exchange, **send a small test transfer first to see if it works**. \u201cLarge\u201d and \u201csmall\u201d amounts are totally subjective based on your portfolio and budget.\n* **ALWAYS double and triple check that your public address is correct** because if it\u2019s wrong and you still send the money, you lose it. Blockchain transactions are *irreversible*. Aside from human error, another thing to remember when sending funds is a scammer\u2019s ability to intercept the public address you\u2019ve copied and replace it with their own. If you don't catch it, you'll paste their address and when you send the funds, you'd send it straight to them. Check your key is correct and send a small test to mitigate these risks.\n* **Write all your passwords down and store them in a safe place.** Don\u2019t try to confuse people you think might read it in the future by using code words and cryptic messages. 20 years down the road you may not remember what you meant and not be able to get into your wallet to access your funds.\n\nYou can get creative with this and even easily encrypt your seed phrase. Just make it plain enough that you can easily be reminded how you encrypted it. [Here\u2019s a great guide on how to do that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mgcs79/guide_on_how_to_secure_your_cold_paper_wallet/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nOther people hide their keys in fake dirty underwear or floorboards. Whatever you choose, make sure it\u2019s secure, even in the chance of a fire (this is one reason why many people like to keep multiple copies of their keys), and in multiple locations including outside of your home.\n\n* **Always make sure to double check that the link you are clicking is correct.** \u201cPhishing\u201d is a very popular scam technique that allows people to install viruses on your computer that can do a number of things when you click their link. Some take your wallet\u2019s public address that you just copied and insert their own address, so that when you send your funds, it goes to them (another good reason to triple check your password before sending funds). In the case that you believe your computer has been compromised with malware, turn it off immediately and take the necessary steps to clean your computer of the malware.\n\nThis tip goes for ANY links you click, but especially when you are logging into exchanges, as scammers can intercept your account info when you log in with their link. Many exchanges will remind you of this, but always make sure you are using the correct link to log in. It should always have \u201chttps\u201d at the beginning to show that it\u2019s secure. \u201cHttp\u201d is very uncommon these days for reputable companies and usually means the website is either not maintained regularly or is a scam. Bookmark each exchange you use and get in the habit of using them in order to decrease your chances of being a target of phishing.\n\n* **Use a new email untied to your name and other personal information when signing up to new exchanges.**\u00a0It\u2019d important to keep your information as private as possible to prevent it from being leaked and used for malicious acts.\u00a0\n* **When downloading apps used to exchange your money for crypto or store your funds, double check the app for credibility.** Check how long it has been an app, how many stars it has along with how many people have reviewed it, who created it, etc. There are many fake wallet apps out there that will steal your seed phrase and funds when you try to log in. Avoid this by double-checking the app's info.\n* **\u201cNot your keys, not your wallet.\u201d** If you are keeping your funds on an exchange or on a platform that does not give you a private key to your wallet, just know that that money is kind of in limbo and is much more vulnerable than it would be in a wallet. While the exchange may say the money belongs to you, technically they have the ability to take it from you whenever, either intentionally or unintentionally.\n* **When opening your wallet, do it offline.** If you use a hot wallet (one that is connected to the internet), turn your device on airplane mode and login to your wallet using your keystore file or seed phrase and/or password, depending on the wallet you are using.\n* **Have 2FA (two-factor authentication) enabled on all exchanges.** Use an authenticator app like Google\u2019s Authenticator app instead of your phone number (scammers can clone your phone number and authenticate their log in to your exchange account).\n* **Avoid using the exchange if they don\u2019t offer 2FA.** 2FA is sometimes the only thing holding back hackers from getting into your account. Some software is able to discover your password but not get past your 2FA if you\u2019re using an authenticator application, as was the case with Binance--one of the world\u2019s most popular exchanges--in their recent hacks. Users who did not have their 2FA enabled or had it enabled with their phone number were the ones who lost their money.\n* On that note, **enable all forms of account security that you can on your exchanges.** Some exchanges allow you to enable security codes sent to your email, 2FA, a password to your account, AND a withdrawal code, all just for making a trade or withdrawing your money. While it may seem like a pain, it is helping your peace of mind when done right. The more blocks you put between a hacker and your funds, the safer from them you will feel and be. That being said, make sure the security measures you put in place are not so difficult for\u00a0*you*\u00a0that you can't get into your wallet/exchange yourself. Spoken from experience.\n\nIt is literally a hacker\u2019s full-time job to find ways to cheat the systems. They are actively looking for loopholes; no doubt there will come more methods to their madness. Exploiting DeFi (decentralized finance) while it\u2019s still new(ish) and vulnerable to attacks is how scam companies make their millions. Fortunately, there are many security precautions we can put in place to secure our funds; above are a handful of some of the most important.\n\nI trust this guide will help you get to your money goals more efficiently, but feel free to leave me a comment letting me know what you think or what I missed.

            "text": "Since there are many new people entering the space here's a quick guide that explains what Compound Finance is! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is compound finance?**\n\nCompound Finance, or Compound, is a DeFi borrowing and lending platform. Users can deposit coins and earn interest or borrow from the platform. Essentially, Compound is similar to a crypto bank. However, the way it works is nothing like a traditional bank and is in fact years ahead in terms of innovation. Firstly, it is decentralized so there is no single authority over the platform that can control how it is run and what changes to make. The users of the platform, who hold the COMP token, are the ones who vote on new rules and changes to the platform. There is no need to create an account and there is no identification required to use their services.\n\nEverything on the platform is executed by smart contracts. They are responsible for automatically paying you interest on your deposits, making sure your loan gets re-payed, or checking that the value of your collateral is enough for your loan. These smart contracts run and execute everything automatically so nothing has to be done on your part. Anybody can use a browser wallet to connect to the app, and they can begin using the services immediately.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Depositing**\n\nTo deposit your funds you need to first make sure that the tokens you wish to deposit are available and that those funds are in the browser wallet that you connected to the platform. Once your tokens are ready, choose the token from the \u201csupply markets\u201d and deposit your desired amount into the platform. Below, you can see that if you were to deposit USDC, you would receive 10.29% per year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdhwb27y6cu61.jpg?width=1252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8fc3632ff17ee60d049a78b3c0159b91030c616\n\n This interest rate is calculated by the number of people taking out loans in USDC. The higher the amount of USDC that is being used for loans, the higher the interest rates are for deposits, this is the utilization rate. Because of this, the interest will vary and won't be stable. You could have a day where your USDC deposit is getting a 5% interest rate or the next day it could get a 15% interest rate.\n\nWhen you deposit your coins onto Compound, you will receive a cToken in return. This cToken will appear in your wallet and will represent the number of tokens you deposited into Compound. When you want to withdraw your deposit, those cTokens will be used to redeem your deposit. If you deposited 500 USDC, you would receive 500 cUSDC. Those 500 cUSDC tokens are used to redeem your 500 USDC and whatever interest you generated.\n\nWith a traditional bank, the interest for your deposits might be paid out once every quarter or once a month if you are lucky. On Compound, the interest on your deposits is paid out every 15 seconds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Borrowing**\n\nIf you want to borrow on Compound you will need to deposit some funds as collateral. This collateral is returned to you when you repay your loan, however, if you don't repay then Compound keeps the collateral you deposited. Compound requires 100% collateral for users to take out loans, so if you wanted to borrow 500 USDC you would have to deposit $500 worth of ETH, or any supported token.\n\nSimilar to how the interest rates for deposits are based on the utilization rate, that also applies for loans. The interest on your loan will be more expensive if a large percentage of the available deposits are being used. Below you can see that the interest rate to borrow USDC is 7.47% however this will vary so it can be higher or lower each day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itkp4wt37cu61.png?width=1854&format=png&auto=webp&s=d725fa3c3cf94f8020880a5eca69d43297665aad\n\n **What is the COMP token?**\n\nThe COMP token is the governance token of the platform. This means that anybody holding the COMP token can vote on changes and decisions that the platform is making. Users depositing and borrowing on Compound receive the COMP token as a reward that is earned for using the platform.\n\nVotes for changes can be on topics like interest rates or other features to add to the platform. While the platform still has developers that have some say in how the platform will run and its changes, it may eventually move to a system where it is completely governed by the users holding COMP tokens. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can find more lessons like this at [https://www.novorauniversity.com/](https://www.novorauniversity.com/)\n\nHope you all found this helpful!",

Close to 11% APR for USDC or other stable coins?!?

I know people who have used Cel or BlockFi and got their returns on a timely manner. I've also see others on reddit who also found reliability in these companies.

But I think the main thing to consider is that there are also fees when you transfer your money to and from the lending platform so the first few months you are only getting back the money you spent on fees. The APR might also go down in a few months when we are not in a bull run anymore. Another thing to consider is the taxes depending on where you live.

But when we look into PayPal's cryptocurrency framework its offers to its users the picture is quite different.\n\nKey points to note:\n\n* No private keys are held by the user\n* Bitcoin cannot be moved to/from PayPal\n* Outside wallets cannot be used to make bitcoin payments\n* Merchants DO not receive any bitcoin, they receive fiat\n\nWhen making a purchase the process is fairly standard, users are given a price along with the fee \\[PayPal markup fee, not tx fee\\]. Purchases are instantaneous. Outside bitcoin cannot be loaded into PayPal, neither can the bitcoin be withdrawn.\n\nNow, while making a purchase, the bitcoin is not actually getting transferred to the merchant, instead, the bitcoin is sold for fiat, and then the payment is made.\n\nIn the entire process, no blockchain transaction took place. Only buy/sell of bitcoin for fiat.\n\nSo in essence PayPal crypto pretty much acts like a PayPal coin, which can only be used on PayPal and nowhere else. Users have really no control over their crypto.\n\nWhile on one side people are happy that a company as big as PayPal started accepting crypto but is this really the way? The entire value of bitcoin and cryptocurrency is non-existent when using PayPal. And surprisingly, no one seems to be talking about this...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: [The Truth About PayPal\u2019s Bitcoin \u201cAdoption\u201d](https://blog.blockonomics.co/the-truth-about-paypals-bitcoin-adoption-b2d4b319b51d)",

Is there merit to this?**\n2. **If the government of your country bans cryptos will you comply?**",

The lira was worth 0,30 euro in 2016 and 0,10 right now. It deflating really fast which makes people look at crypto as a way to save money there. Like the lira can only deflate while crypto in general inflates. I think it's a really petty move, and I'm not really sure what it would mean for the lira if most Turkish people would swap to crypto, which a lot of them are doing.   \n\n\nMy government would never ban crypto, they'd at most tax it because when they smell money they will want a cut.

It's all in the public domain. I gave up documenting once I realized there was no end to this group's empire.\n\nI believe a large chunk of crypto scams are committed by only a small number of groups of scammers. So what can I do to take this particular group down? I sent an email to a cryptocurrency scam law firm. Waiting for them to get back to me.\n\nThe thing I can't understand is how can these people not get caught? Others are obviously already aware of this group of scammers. Ripple for example has a forensics team that has been mapping their transactions for more than two years. They know funds are getting dumped onto exchanges.\n\nSo yhy can't someone just get domain registrars, website hosts, or reputable exchanges like Binance to hand over their personal identity? I find no evidence of people trying and failing to do this. Reputable exchanges are supposed to verify your identity to make an account, right? Are places like Binance simply not cooperating? Are they cooperating but the scammers used fake ID? Are people not even trying to contact places like Binance? One article I read by a victim of a scam claimed that crypto companies and exchanges have an incentive to fail. Could this be true?\n\nAnd even if they get passed the exchanges, they can't \"cash out\" unless they transfer money to a bank, which should definitely have their personal ID, right?",

It sucked, I'm over it and I learned my lesson. Before the ban I moved my funds to Wirex, which then charged insane fees and had a bug that didn't allow me to sell over a certain amount, the amount was the equivalent to $40 so, really Wirex?\n\nI got Trust Wallet now but for my Dapp operations. If you want a reliable wallet that just launched, that has its regulatory licenses and offers insurance on lost funds (fuck you Coinbase) I suggest you check Zeply. Sadly is available only for EU users atm and supports BTC. But as many others, plans are to launch globally this year and supporting other Crypto wallets.\n\nThis is like using Revolut to buy Crypto but with 0% Fees and you can actually send and receive them, within the regulatory space, I would recommend this option.\n\nAlways be cautious when holding your coins, don't make the same mistake I did. If you wanna try my wallets which I even fucking ensured were good cause I reached out to their Customer Support just to see if they were quick responsive, I leave the links for you. Zeply I think is even supported as payment method on few exchanges and brokers, but that I leave to you for research.\n\nWww.zeply.com (Website)\n\nApp.zeply.com/signup (App access)\n\nTrust Wallet (Apple Store / Google Play)\n\nIf you have better, safer options for beginners, share them out. Im always looking to learn more.\n\nStay safe,\n\nA Blockchain Believer and Journalist.",

There\u2019s a number of platforms that are currently working on a gasless model, and it\u2019s worthwhile to explore them as this very well could be the breakthrough crypto needs to make our community truly accessible to the masses.\r\n\r\nPolkaDot $DOT/Kasuma $KSM\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s more like buying real estate than buying a token at this point. Parachains will be auctioned off to the highest bidders. The benefit of this will be two-fold. The fact that these will be gasless environments will certainly attract users of all kinds, both rich and poor. The additional engagement will lead to higher engagement and benefit the projects significantly, as well as their tokens.\r\n\r\nCurate $XCUR\r\n\r\nCurate is building a shopping/marketplace/NFT app and they just announced that they\u2019re building their own gasless chain called The X-Chain XCUR (XC-20). This means that when their app is released that we\u2019ll be able to have access to buy anything in XCUR\u2019s ecosystem with no additional gas fees. They already partnered up with Shopping.io and Travala. Being able to shop for NFTs, anything on major platforms that they\u2019re connected to and do P2P trades as well.\r\n\r\nFTX.Com $FTT\r\n\r\nWhen you stake 150 FTT, all withdrawals on FTX.com are covered by the platform. The savings add up very quickly for anyone that\u2019s doing a lot of trading via open wallets. You\u2019re paying a ton of gas fees as you move your tokens from your primary wallet to MetaMask to use with Uni. At least FTX cuts into that while also providing solid hourly APYs for a ton of tokens. After buying Miami\u2019s Heat stadium naming rights away from American Airlines I\u2019m also not worried about them disappearing out of the blue.\r\n\r\nWhat other projects are you seeing that are gasless?",

The main goal of Etherland is to create a real ecosystem with the help of their fungible ELAND token and NFT LAND IDs.\n\n**Etherland\u2019s mission** \n\nEtherland\u2019s mission is to create an immutable digital identity on their blockchain for every real estate on the planet. They want the owners to provide their users (and the owners) with control over the information about the property and get verified, adding this extra layer of data digitally would provide the users with information that can be used as legal evidence.\n\nAnyone around the world can become a part of this Metaverse, even if they are not a real estate owner. All a user needs to do is to create a LAND ID token of a place and upload valid information which would be then verified by Etherland before approving the creation of the LAND ID.\n\n**LAND IDs and Estatepedia** \n\nAs mentioned earlier, every real estate listed on the platform will have a unique LAND ID which would allow users to represent any place in the world be it their own estate or a famous monument, in a secular and fully decentralized manner. All of these would be listed on the blockchain as an NFT in the form of the LAND ID (ERC-721 token).\n\nThe LAND ID itself displays the country, type of terrain, infrastructure, city, and number of additions on the type of infrastructure. For example, the Pyramids of Giza would have the cadastral number EG.L.M.G.1 which stands for Egypt/landmark/Monument/Giza/1. Along with the LAND ID photos, videos, coordinates, all other important information about the place is also listed on Estatepedia.\n\nThe Estatepedia is Etherland\u2019s marketplace wherein every listed place has its own page with details such as its map localization, real estate data, wiki website content along with visuals and videos. Estatepedia uses IPFS and the Ethereum blockchain together as a decentralized way of storing and exchanging this information.\n\nEtherland is opening its marketplace for its users where they can now create their own LAND IDs with just a few good quality pictures, description, and a video which is then checked and verified by the team at Etherland.\n\n**The ELAND token and its use cases** \n\nELAND is an upgraded ERC-20 blockchain protocol used on the Etherland platform and it can be used for gaming, data storage, green projects, and real estate applications. Some of the use cases of the ELAND token are,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* A means of purchasing unique tokens that mirror      real-world places\n* Crowdfunding and Reward Ethical Green Projects      and Real Estates\n* As a reward for stalking NFTs\n* Creating and securing immutable ERC20 token on      the blockchain\n* Gameplay and promotional reward for participating      in the building of the World Metaverse\n* As entry fee for platforms and products that      user\u2019s access\n\nELAND would be used to interact with the platform on every level and when new LAND IDs are minted and added to the marketplace. The token is available on Uniswap and PancakeSwap and can be traded on Bilaxy. The ETH/ELAND pair\u2019s orders can be analyzed on Dextools.\n\n**AR mode and Green Economy model**\n\nThe Etherland mobile application is aiming to bring a 3D Augmented Reality mode for users which would be linked to their Land Identification Tokens (LAND IDs). The users will get the opportunity to receive NFTs directly to their Ethereum wallet if they catch the corresponding AR. A user or property owner can also validate their ownership using the same process.\n\nTo do its bit for the environment, Etherland plans to reward users who provide an Energy Efficiency Rating and its Environmental impact certificate with Carbon Credit Rewards.\n\nEvery property based on land and registered with a LAND ID on their marketplace is eligible for this reward, one which will be credited in ELAND to the linked with the LAND ID. The ratings range from D to A, the closer to the A rating, the higher the reward.\n\n\\*Text copied from ambcrypto.com (Crypto news magazine)\n\n**Details about Eland**\n\n\u00b7 Holders: 750\n\n\u00b7 Mcap: 8 miill\n\n\u00b7 Available on uniswap, bilaxy (ETH) and pancakeswap (BSC)\n\n\u00b7 Non anon Team\n\n\u00b7 App release in a few days",

I came across something about \"staking\" your crypto coins which seems like the way to go for \"buy and hold\" investors? Not sure so I came here: \n\nSo, I understand the concept of staking, but how does it physically work? Do I buy coins from any platform, CBpro, Binance etc. and then move these coins to a specific wallet that \"allows\" staking? \n\nBeing new to this, I had the idea that crypto investing was similar to regular market investing in the sense that you just buy and hold the coin on the platform/exchange of your choice. But now it seems the only way to get regular returns on your investment is to stake the coins you buy in a wallet which is in fact a different platform/application than the original platform/application used to actually purchase the coins... is this correct? \n\nAlso, can I just use any wallet to stake any coin, or are there specific wallets to stake a specific variety of coins? If this is the case, what does the start to finish of your investment look like? for example, would it be: \n\nbuy coins from exchange>move to \"stake wallet\" (SW)>continue to buy and add to SW> eventually move to hardware wallet for max security \n\n????\n\nI'm more concerned with the physical process that I have to undergo to buy/trade and earn on the coins that I buy.\n\nThanks in advance for information on this. I would also appreciate links to websites/materials (THAT ARE FREE) to review if possible.",

For HODLing. Do some research on these 3 and you\u2019ll have a good knowledge base. Also Coinbase has an learn/earn program where you watch short videos about different projects, answer a couple multiple choice questions about the video and they give you some of the projects coins for free. I think you can get about $30 or so. Welcome to Crypto! May your bags be full and your returns be many",

I've read up on the technology of blockchain, how it works, how the transactions are verified etc, and I'm starting to get a bit of a handle on it.\n\nJust as an experiment, I used walletbuilders to create a \"free\" coin. From what I can tell it's just a litecoin fork with my provided info in it. They provided a windows and a linux wallet (just copies of the bog standard litecoin wallet) and I gave a copy to my friends to look at (they're mostly all tech nerds as well, programmers, sysadmins etc.) We all spun up CPU mining apps and mined the first 100 or so blocks, mostly joking we'd use it to pay for beers/poker when we hung out.\n\nThat night I went to bed, shut the first node down, and didn't think much of it. Over the course of the next few days, my friends continued mining. GPU mining started soon after, and now we are 500+ blocks into the chain. Every morning I wake up, and sure enough, more blocks have been mined, and connections on the network are still active.\n\nIt got me thinking, it's no wonder these initial shitcoins all drag people in. These coins we created have zero value anywhere, yet we can't stop ourselves from mining a few more here and there. Every time our group chat fires up, it inevitable turns to how many coins we are holding now.\n\nI even had the thought that maybe I should publicly tell people about it, but I got worried that maybe people will react just like my friends, but I got concerned that maybe everyone else would be in the same boat, knowing full well that it's a useless shitcoin, but will keep mining it anyway!\n\nIt's been a great experience to understand the chain/mining/confirming transactions, but I can also see the lure of these things, and even with full knowledge of the uselessness of it, we're all still spending $ (power) mining these things!\n\nLong story short, I fully recommend everyone try to understand the fundamentals of these crypto coins, but be aware of your own FOMO if you plan to spend any serious time/money/resources on it.\n\nEdit 1: fine you loonies. Wallets are here:\n\nhttps://www.walletbuilders.com/mycoin?coin=5e8f9e0409ab7cc3afad851b4edc2a2f76312c77e6e08cbde6\n\nMine it like you mine litecoin (scrypt).

            "text": "OK, so this may well not be news to many of you... but I was thinking recently back to a time where I created a really simple chrome extension which replaced a phrase anywhere it came up on any page you visited with another phrase. It had me thinking about a potential abuse within Crypto (and possibly outside).\n\nImagine if a chrome extension were to look at the page you visit, and if its determined to be a crypto exchange deposit page, it would change the deposit address shown on the exchange to their own address. Why would someone install such an extension? well, it would be a sort of trojan horse I guess, where you install it because on face value it provides something else which you deem useful.\n\nIt worried me, because at the time I was away from my computer but I had an extension installed, which allowed for comparing 2 crypto's to tell the exchange price between them. It was very possible that they were already doing something behind the scenes I didn't like.\n\nSo, I built a very basic chrome extension in developer mode (I never released it of course) to test out the theory.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/t62Lj\n\nSo there, it shows the current price of the top 5 coins by market cap, and shows a somewhat arbitrary advice for whether to buy, hodl or sell. I just made that up from looking at whether the 24h, 7d and 1m change %'s were positive or negative. If 2+ were positive, show buy. if 1 was positive, show HODL, else show sell. Users of the extension would be none the wiser as to the actual workings of it, and it would update day to day for them to make it look like it was actually calculating something.\n\nAnyway, thats all fine and dandy, but not dangerous yet. So, I looked back at the old tutorial I used to replace phrases on web pages you visit.\n\nhttps://9to5google.com/2015/06/14/how-to-make-a-chrome-extensions/\n\nSo, I went through and made a few changes to the manifest, and then made a new script which would be injected into each page you visit. The script would do nothing, unless the URl of the current page matched within a switch statement. Within that switch, were rules for how to replace the deposit address at an exchange.\n\nI could have done this likely an most, if not all exchanges, however I tried it out with success at HitBTC. Heres a screenshot of what the deposit page looks like, without me doing anything other than having this extension installed.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/F8bVM\n\nAS you can see, the BTC deposit address has changed from whatever HitBTC wants to show, to \"test\". This could easily be some attackers actual bitcoin wallet. I also tested the Copy button, and this copied out test to clipboard as well, rather than the real bitcoin deposit address.\n\nJust want to clarify, this is not a vulnerability with HitBTC, or any other exchange for that matter. If you are running injected JS on their pages, then anything can happen regardless of anything they may do.\n\nThis isn't the only negative thing someone could easily put into a chrome extension either, its just the first use case I thought of. Until now, I had installed chrome extensions without much thought or care for the security issues. That's definitely changed now, and I hope that by posting this more people can think twice about this, as its likely only a matter of time before this happens. I have fairly limited web dev knowledge, and I still thought of this possibility.\n\n**tl;dr** - It is possible to create what appears to be a useful chrome extension, whereas chrome extensions have permission to inject js into any page you visit - One potential abuse of this would be to change the deposit address at an exchange into an attackers deposit address, causing you to send crypto to the attacker, not the exchange. Be careful installing extensions you aren't familiar with!\n\n\nNOTE: I did try posting this into r/CryptoCurrency first, but did not meet the minimum karma... :(",

It is currently $221.\n\nBitcoin hit $540 on its 1779 day of existence. \nMonero hit $540 on its 1362 day of existence.\n\nMonero is displacing Bitcoin as a transactional currency/cash. It has displaced bitcoin on the darknet, no other coins has ever done this.  It has grown comparably fast despite the different code base, despite the competition and maximalist narrative, despite coinbase and many other exchanges not listing it. Despite the regulatory fear! Despite the fact it is harder to use and harder to understand both on a conceptual technical level (ringCt, stealth addresses, etc) but also an economic level: why being fungible and private is **needed**. \n\nEveryone can understand the utility of cheap to transact anonymous digital cash that acts as a store of value and a means of exchange.  Thats the holy grail! Of course they can understand it, they may not like it, but they understand it. \n\nYou should feel afraid about your investment in Monero:  the future is uncertain and even our best judgement can be wrong. Maybe it goes to zero. \nBut maybe your fear shouldn't be entirely of monero failing: it should also be fear of not having enough! \n\n A fear of reading about it and understanding but not acting. \n\nThat you didn't get as many as you could have, within your personal risk tolerance, and having it increase in value more than bitcoin did from 2015 to 2021. ($221 to $58,000+) \n\nDon't look back at this moment in 2026, 5 years from now with regret, knowing *today* that it is useful, it is scarce, it currently has lower inflation than Bitcoin, arguably a better stock to flow, that it has a massive community on both the clearnet and darknet and that it's features are not just trivially to add to Bitcoin, and that it is the top fungible currency, with a gap of billions of dollars between it and a potential competitor. \n\n\nMonero isn't perfect but it is a damn honest effort: \n\nAnonymous, Private, Untraceable? Yes, look to the darknet or chainanalysis for supporting evidence. \n\nFungible? Yes. Each bitcoin has a socially useful history, each monero does not. \n\nScarce? Yes, in 2040 both monero and btc will hit approximately  the same number, 21 million. \n\nDecentralized development? Yes, its open source for all to see, copy and share. Multiple wallets exist.\n\nDecentralized Mining? Yes, We got RandomX. \n\nPost Block Reward Security? YES! we got a tail emission. Bitcoin has hope, but no solution. \n\nMultisig, Cross Chain Atomic Swaps? Yes and soon. \n\nA large diverse & rapidly growing community? Yes. \n\nMemes? We're working on it, damn it! \n\nThere's 32 trillion in off shore money, 15% to 30% of the economic activity in every country is the informal economy (gray-black market).   People like privacy, people are worried about inflation: some place is always struggling with it. People need to transact to eat and live. \n\nWhat more do you need? If this isn't enough are you even in the Crypto space?\n\nChrist, hold at least 1 XMR for the next 5 years. Make a paper wallet and forget about it.",

Unfortunately, due to the sensitive legal nature of the application, I can't disclose too much, but what I will say is I'm extremely excited to see First Blockchain Bank and Trust open our doors! One of the reasons this is so exciting is that we are the first national bank integrating fiat deposits and cryptocurrency custody, trading, trust services, and seeking full FDIC insurance and Federal Reserve membership with Fedwire and ACH access. It is truly a historic moment in cryptocurrency and banking, and I'm honored to have the opportunity to open the first full bank charter with blockchain integrated deeply. Specifically, Proton blockchain for MFA, identity, and transfers - also the usual players, MTL, BTC, ETH and more to come.",

With FBB we plan to integrate Proton blockchain first and foremost for security with multi-factor authentication (MFA) using Proton Signing Request (PSR). The ability to add identity to the blockchain and quickly and easily issue blockchain-based assets to real identifiable consumers and corporations is the first step for major corporate tech adoption. Simultaneously, the gas problem needs to be eliminated, and that's exactly what we did with Proton.",

Some of my favorite moments in crypto were working with the Dogecoin Foundation and community raising money for charity. When Metal first started we worked together with Richard Branson, Virgin Unite, National Tennis Foundation and Premier Live to raise close to a million dollars to rebuild schools and homes in the BVI after Hurricane Irma. Moving forward, we are planning on doing philanthropic work for disadvantaged communities, focused on enhancing financial literacy. When I think about what we did building a well in Africa with Dogecoin this also gets me nostalgic. What types of ideas do you think we should pursue? One of the sayings in Dogecoin is \"Do only good everyday\" and the motto at Metal is \"Always act in good faith with full transparency and accountability\" We strongly believe in doing good as a company and making the most positive impact we possibly can.",

I highly suggest to just check out the roadmap\n\nWhitepapers are here as well...\n\nhttps://sylo.io/network/how/#whitepapers\n\nSYLO has a dedicated team and this project is extremely undervalued in my opinion. I can see it easily going 100x from now until the end of 2021. Only $0.005 at the moment but once more people see the new roadmap, it will likely shoot up past $0.01 soon.\n\nThe SYLO community is also amazing. I have been on two of their telegram channels for a while. Their admin is also quite active and supportive there.\n\nI rarely post on here because I do not want to ever be responsible for someone losing money on something that I suggest. This is how confident I am in SYLO doing well short and long term.\n\nFor those of you who are not familiar with this project; SYLO's app will be an easy way for us to all communicate with others via messaging, and also to track crypto and a wallet to send and receive crypto payments. This app will help to keep things all in one place and to ensure privacy.\n\nThe wallet will allow you to stake/bake Tezos. The crypto tracker has been released now. Soon we will be able to send, store, and receive NFTs with our wallet. Soon we will be able to stake SYLO within our wallet. And so much more!\n\nI will not be surprised if SYLO reaches $1.00+ within the next 1-3 years. Hundreds of thousands of people are already using the SYLO app, and this is only the beginning.\n\nThis is taken directly from their website...\n\nThe Sylo Network is a decentralised communication and storage network with the performance and scalability to support millions of users. Applications use the network for decentralised, private communication, storage, and micro-payments.\n\nInstead of centralised cloud server infrastructure, Sylo users create the decentralised Sylo Network together by running Sylo Node software on their own computers. By running a Sylo Node, users earn Sylo Token in exchange for their device automatically providing critical services to the network.\n\nThe Sylo community is providing the world with what large centralised platforms have been unwilling to - real privacy and a level playing field.",

This is where value creation becomes key and inherently present in the Sylo network.Because Sylo is one of the most widely adopted ***scalable PROTOCOLS for high volume APPLICATIONS in that ecosystem***, it also becomes a **forerunner in decentralised messaging.\u201d**\n\nThis comes down to Sylo\u2019s unique**, totally decentralised infrastructure** which **relies on incentivised**, **user-run nodes** for communications relay.\n\nI could go on and on but altogether, in my view this project is about to explode! They have a small market cap and the right partnerships, and when people realize this, they will buy.\n\nIF you\u2019re reading this, make sure you\u2019re not one of the unlucky ones to miss out on Sylo before it goes to the moooooon!\n\nThanks for checking out my forehead thoughts on Sylo\n\nWish you happy investing ...

As CB only accepts the known 4 cryptos....my Snovio tokens (worth USD +80,000) were inaccessible.\n\nI can see them listed on Etherscan in my wallet, but I cant access them as only CB has ownership of my wallet key.\n\nI opened a ticket and asked them to kindly reverse the transaction, they said that because this is blockchain technology, and because they don't recognize this token, the transaction cannot be reversed.\n\nIn other words, CB has my money but will not give it back.\n\nIs there anything I can do to get this money back?

Their system simply doesn't function in a way that allows them to retrieve them or reverse the transaction.  It is theoretically possible, but they would need to modify their system, which would cost them more than 80000USD.\nThey explicitly warn against doing this because of their system limitation.  Focus on making back that 80000 with the rest of your portfolio.  By the end of this year, you won't miss that $ as much.",

            "text": "So you\u2019re still not mining and don't know where to start? Or you\u2019re already mining but want more? Choose the best mining pool! We\u2019ll tell you what to look for.\n\n**Reward System**\n\nIt\u2019s better to look at how lucky the pool is (if we are talking about PPLNS) or at the logic of the reward calculation (if it is PPS+, as that\u2019s exactly how this \u201c+\u201d is calculated).\n\n**Hashrate, Uncles, Rejects**\n\nAll these values \u200b\u200bmatter if you mine on PPLNS or PPS+, where the reward is calculated based on the block found by the pool. Each pool has its own statistics and its own reward calculation system. At CoinFly Pool, we calculate the reward according to the average daily value, thereby removing the risks associated with the pool's success from the users.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u5rvy7c6dbp51.png?width=999&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd41545b05fb8a8f31218c1f8a722c78a4f9d444\n\n**Where the Servers Are Located**\n\nIn theory, the same equipment, launched at the same time on different pools, will mine a different amount, also because the server was closer to one of the pools. Therefore, it is ideal if the servers are located on the same continent as you.\n\n**Commission Fees**\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem bad if this value is 0. But it also happens that the pool makes such a good profit that there is enough for the 3% commission and for decent payouts to its miners.\n\n**Coins**\n\nIf it's not ETH or Ethereum Classic, then you can choose something specific. But you need to properly calculate whether you have enough power to mine that sh\\*\\*coin and also be quick to sell it at a good price. As one never knows what will happen to its rate tomorrow.\n\n**Dual mining**\n\nIt seems like an awesome idea: mine a few coins, collect them in both pockets. But then let\u2019s take the Ezil.me pool for example. It offers dual mining with a 10% profit. We\u2019ve been watching it for a while and here\u2019s the thing: even the +10% calculations on its calculator were less than ours on the [CoinFly pool](https://ethpool.coinfly.cc/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=article&utm_content=medium).\n\nAuto-switching\n\nThe pool automatically switches your mining to a coin which is more profitable to mine at the moment. However, this is typically carried out without taking into account the specifics of the equipment, which is not good. Again, the profit of the Whalesburg pool, which offers auto-switching, is lower in comparison to CoinFly.\n\n**The place of the pool on Miningpoolstats**\n\nSometimes you can earn more on a small pool than on such giants as Ethermine. One of the crypto bloggers made a comparison on YouTube, where for example, Ethermine distributed 5% less than a small pool.\n\nAnd the bottom line: you have to try and compare. The pool that has transferred more coins to your wallet is surely the good one. And it doesn't matter what hashrate it has or with what type of magic their admin is practicing.",

            "text": "*We have three great new developments to announce to the Ergo community, all of which will boost our user base and decentralisation!*\n\nWe have not just one but three outstanding developments for the Ergo ecosystem to announce! Together, these will make it easier than ever before to acquire, trade, store and spend ERG \u2013 and will open up a huge new potential community of users, developers and hodlers.\n\nCoinsbit listing and airdrop\n\nFirstly, ERG has been listed on Coinsbit: a major trading platform that enables fiat deposits and withdrawals via debit and credit card. Ergo will be listed in three pairs:\n\n* ERG/BTC\n* ERG/USDT\n* ERG/USD\n\nWe anticipate this will bring new traders and liquidity to the currency. The Coinsbit Telegram group has around 120,000 members, so this is a great opportunity to welcome new people to the community.\n\nTo celebrate this landmark development and promote Ergo to new traders, we are holding a joint airdrop. The conditions are as follows:\n\n* Join Ergo\u2019s Telegram chat: https://t.me/ergoplatform\n* Register on Coinsbit and complete KYC\n* Send your Coinsbit username to [u/Coinsbit](https://www.reddit.com/u/Coinsbit/) on Telegram\n* Receive your 5 ERG airdrop!\n\nThe airdrop will run for just 10 days and is limited to the first 5,000 participants, so don\u2019t delay!\n\nCypra wallet\n\nThe second major development is that Ergo will be integrated with the Cypra wallet. This is a fantastic multi-currency desktop and mobile wallet. It\u2019s secure, open-source and non-custodial \u2013 making it super easy and convenient to deal with your coins!\n\nCypra is designed to address the worst shortcomings of conventional wallets, exchanges and payment services. It enables users to spend their crypto on real-world purchases with minimal friction and the lowest crypto-to-fiat conversion fees.\n\nYou can find out more in Cypra\u2019s one-page summary. Check it out, keep your ERG safe and user them in a variety of cool ways!\n\nErgo mining pool\n\nLastly, we have Ergo\u2019s first mining pool!\n\nThis is a really interesting development, since Ergo includes protection against ordinary pools by design. This is a feature implemented to improve decentralisation and accessibility for smaller, regular miners.\n\nJason, the pool owner, has created a decentralised pool using a smart contract that ensures miners who connect to the pool get paid. This is an intriguing example of smart contracts being used to bypass or change the consensus of a platform. It\u2019s DeFi and community participation in action.\n\nYou can find the pool at erg.ezpool.io. There are plans to implement the Stratum protocol and efficient mining software after the pool launches.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to find out more about the theory behind pool mining on Ergo, we have an academic paper that was presented at Financial Cryptography 2020.\n\nThat\u2019s all for now \u2013 but stay tuned, because we have more developments on the way!",

The \"many\" spend their life trying to grow their wealth and are slaved by the \"few\". cryptocurrency will allow unbanked to enter in a global network.\n\n7)  69 percent of adults \u2013 3.8 billion people \u2013  have an account at a bank or mobile money provider, some 1.7 billion adults worldwide still don't have access to a bank account! There are 2.71 billion people that own a smartphone.\n\n6) Institutions are spending and dedicating resources to study, implement and develop future applications.\n\n5) Governments are regulating the cryptoshpere with laws. Why would someone regulate something if they believe it won't last.\n\n4) The more time it pass, the more people just become subconsciously aware of cryptocurrency, and start to accept it.\n\n3) Data is the new oil, and as we are the miners of our own datas, we shall be rewarded, but how can we be rewarded with todays slow system? with cryptocurrency this is possible and immediate. Moreover, It's simply stupid to put all your eggs in one basket.\n\n2) We are leaving in a world where there is no more privacy and people have no idea how to handle this. Everyone with a bit of resources can track down and violate identity and wealth of an individual. Cryptocurrency can help to prevent this.\n\n1) Ownership nowadays is a luxury, you don't own the money in your bank account, if bank decide that \"your\" money cannot be withdrawn, then you can just pray.  \n\n\nNOT YOUR KEYS, not your carNOT YOUR KEYS, not your homeNOT YOUR KEYS, not your safe-deposit boxNOT YOUR KEYS, not your cryptocurrencyNOT YOUR KEYS, not your money.\n\nI believe we are heading toward the most catastrophic financial crisis of all times, the closer we get to it, the more people will want to diversify and buy gold and cryptocurrencies.\n\nI am sure there are hundreds of other reasons, it would be cool to hear them from YOU and see what are the reason you believe to support or destroy my list!\n\nI look forward to read your replies!\n\n(Chart isn't mine, and not sure who created it, but i think he got it right!)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/et8uidwapio31.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ab5558f392de2aeedd010d6a45ee09d88181c4dd",

            "text": "Well I bring you good news as Bluzelle staking is live. \nBut before I go into the full details I will like to run you through what staking means . \n\nWhat is Staking?\nWhen it comes to staking in cryptocurrency. This gives you an opportunity to earn more coin / money . \n\nOk so after saying that let me define what staking means \nStaking is the process of hodl coins in a crypto currency wallet and also showing support to the platform . This gives currency owners some decision power on the system .\n\nYou know how you deposit your money in the bank and it yields interest well similarly that's how it is in the cryptosphere. By staking one gains the ability to vote and generate income. So staking gives investors the ability to earn a dialy income on their coin staked . \n\nSo now you know what staking is . Let's go over to how to stake in the Bluzelle site . \n\n\nGuide for token conversation and staking \n\nBluzelle runs a dual token system . Erc20 token Blz and the Bluzelle BNT token which will be used to stake and do other transactions . \n\nSome important things go note before the Bluzelle staking \n\nPlease Note:\n\nThe staking website is currently using http instead of https. While we make sure your security data (such as mnemonics) are generated locally and is not travel over the wire, you should take your own risk to use the current website. It\u2019s in our plan to implement HTTPS so you can also wait for this to be updated.\n\nWe only support Metamask at the moment and will add more wallet support (such as mobile wallet, Ledger, Wallet Connect) in later stage.\n\nYou can only convert between 10 \u2014 250,000 BLZ for each transaction.\n\nThe token conversion process is semi-automated and it is conducted through our Ethereum-Cosmos relayer. You can deposit your BLZ tokens through our dashboard at any time, but the relayer will be run manually, multiple times a day. Therefore, you will expect a delay in conversion.\n\nThe Bluzelle BNT wallet is created only for the Phase 1 Soft Mainnet. At the end of Phase 1, we will return you with the staked tokens and the rewards in form of BLZ. You will need to create another account when Phase 2 Production Mainnet launches in September.\n\nToken conversion is currently only one way from BLZ to BNT. We will only return you the BLZ at the end of Phase 1. No conversion from BNT back to BLZ is available during this period.\n\nToken conversions are conducted at your own risk. Any mistakes can result in the loss of funds. Please follow the steps provided in this guide to avoid any misbehaviour.\n\nPlease note that we are working on an emerging tech, in the case where we have a non-recoverable crash of our Soft Mainnet, we will return everyone back exactly the BLZ you converted to BNT at the start.\n\n\ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ufe0f If you encounter any issue regarding conversion and staking, you can\u00a0ask us on Discord. Our team and community member will be happy to help you out.\n\nInstruction\n\nStep 1 \u2014 Load Your Ethereum BLZ Account on Metamask\n\nBefore anything hope to fill your wallet with enough Eth to send your Blz and also make sure you are on the Etheruem mainnet. \n\n Step 2 \u2014 Create a Bluzelle BNT & Matches With Your Ethereum Account\n\nOn\u00a0staking.bluzelle.com, click \u201clogin\u201d. On Metamask, allow your BLZ account to connect with the site.\n\n\nFor new users, you will be shown the seed phrase. Please make sure you have copied it and saved it in a secure place. You will need it EVERY TIME you log in. If you lose it, you will lose your whole account and may result in permanent loss of your fund. The Bluzelle team does not own your seed phases and would not be able to recover for you.\n\nNext, put in the seed phrase that you previously generated and proceed. You need to sign the transaction on Metamask so that your new Bluzelle BNT wallet is successfully mapped with your Ethereum account. This will ensure that the correct amount of BNT tokens are converted into your Bluzelle wallet.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Convert ERC20 BLZ to BNT\n\nOnce you are logged in, you will see your accounts. Make sure your BLZ balance is shown correctly.\n\nUnder the Ethereum account block, click \u201cConvert to BNT\u201d and input the amount. You can only send between 10\u2013250,000 BLZ for every transaction.\n\n\nOn Metamask, confirm your transaction (you will need some ETH for gas).\n\n\nThe ERC20 tokens will be sent and locked in the Bluzelle Official House Wallet. You can view your transaction by clicking \u201cCheck on Etherscan\u201d.\n\n\nDo\u00a0NOT\u00a0send BLZ tokens directly to the house wallet from exchanges or any other wallet\u2014 if you do, you risk losing your funds forever. Please only use our staking dashboard and follow the flow.\n\nThe amount of ERC20 BLZ deposited will be equivalent to the amount of BNT tokens you will receive. You will expect hours of delay as the ETH-Cosmos relayer will only be run multiple times a day. The delay would be a maximum of 24 hours.\n\nOnce the relayer is run, you will see your BNT token balance under your account and you can also check it from Bluzelle Explorer.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Stake & Earn\n\nOnce you receive your BNT tokens, you can start staking immediately.\n\nClick on the \u201cStake\u201d button, you will see a list of validators you can delegate to.\n\n\nSelect the validator and enter the amount of stake.\n\n\nPlease note that for every transaction, you will need 2 BNT as network fee. So make sure you leave sufficient available BNT balance. For example, if you have 1000 BNT in your \u201cavailable balance\u201d, you can only stake a maximum of 998 in this transaction.\n\nYou can also unstake from a validator any time. However, your BNT tokens will go into a 21-day unbonding period, which means you can\u2019t use these tokens to redelegate to another validator to earn rewards during this period. We suggest you keeping your tokens staked to earn the rewards for the full phase 1.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 View & Claim Rewards\n\nThere are two parts of Bluzelle staking rewards:\n\nNetwork fees\n\nYou can view and claim this under the \u201cMy account\u201d page, \u201cMy rewards\u201d section. You need to have 2 BNT in your available balance to send a \u201cclaim reward\u201d request. These rewards can be used immediately (no unbonding period)\n\n\n\nAdditional staking rewards from the Bluzelle Pool\n\nWe have explained this part of the rewards in details in our\u00a0staking economics. These rewards will be sent to your Bluzelle account every 24 hours. It will add to your \u201cavailable balance\u201d automatically and can be used immediately.\n\n\n\nSo with this you will have a smooth and profitable ride in the Bluzelle staking .",

So thats why im here.\n\nI made I little plan for myself on how to invest my excess money every month - maybe it's not a good one but let me explain it a bit:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm currently \"only\" investing in BTC ETH and ADA since that is my first month of getting into crypto. I also have some other cryptos in mind but that's something for the next months... But all in all im going for a long term investment for my future (im 24) instead of day-trading/lever etc.\n\nI figured out that just hodl my coins isn't enough for me, and while just hodl my coins I can also earn some interest with it right? \n\nSo I did my own research and as a result I found Daedalus for my ADA Coins and saw a big advantage (in my opinion) compared to stacking fiat money in bank. Im still owner of my coins and don't really borrow them to a \"bank\" and still got a good APY%.\n\nBut if I want to earn interest on my BTC or ETC, I can either see storing your bitcoins in an exchange (for me it would be Binance in that example) but with an APY around 1,20%. Or I see some website which offer storing BTC/ETH in your wallet and earn interest or doing that in an exchange like Binance, but im seeing APYs around 8-12%. Why is here such a big difference in APYs - and can I trust sites which offer me that %? Im kinda confused because Binance (which I see as kinda \"serious\") offer me such a low rate compared to other sites.\n\nAm I seeing something wrong or is that normal and I should find the right \"Company\" to earn interest for every coin I got? And as a last question - Im thinking about a hardware wallet so im not depending on my current PC/Smartphone but is it harder or maybe even worse to earn interest with a hardware wallet?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in Advance   \nand sorry for any spelling mistake or grammar mistake",

            "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've come across an interesting little project called Bundles Finance ($bund). I bought in at 192,000 market cap for a quick flip, but as I learned about it I decided I like it even more, and am looking for more opinions on it. It's currently sitting at a 1.2 mil cap and no one really knows about it yet.\n\nBund is an innovative way to earn rewards via staking. Is it like every other defi staking platform you've come across 100 times this year? No, not exactly (touching on this below the pasted article information). The creator, Simon Lewis, is extremely into human behavior. Bund was created with the intention to keep peoples attention spans, while also not consistently injecting new coins into the Bund economy. There's currently a circulating supply of 72,000, 97,000 max, and the devs 10,000 tokens have been locked for a year (November 2021), with a few thousand other tokens set aside for marketing (which is starting) and community incentives. Here's a quick snippet from one of their Medium articles touching upon the two topics I just discussed briefly:\n\n\" **THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND OUR PLATFORM AND WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN THE BUNDLES COMMUNITY.**\n\nHave you ever entered a trade on Uniswap or another exchange without any real conviction but simply because you wanted to feel \u2018something\u2019? Do you check your Blockfolio several times an hour? This is all to do with reward and the spikes in dopamine we receive upon the outcome of our portfolio value. Interestingly, the resulting performance (a profit or a loss) matters less than the actual anticipation of the outcome.\n\nIt is well known that social media platforms use psychological techniques to influence the time spent on a platform and several crypto projects are subconsciously using these techniques, but I believe we will be the first to use them to maintain relevance and usability in a very fickle space. We will follow up in the next 48 hours with a more detailed article on the psychology behind our platform but we incorporate:\n\n* Leaderboards to facilitate social interaction, community, social belonging and motivation.\n* Variable rewards\n* Real time data on your performance and the ability to check easily\n* A \u2018Hall of Fame\u2019 to create reward on a neural level\n* A simple web platform with which to interact\n\n**TOKENOMICS**\n\nMany staking projects suffer from an ever increasing supply of tokens which ultimately rapidly decreases the price of a token. Many investors are caught out by looking at a market cap based on circulating supply and not realising that this supply will rapidly increase over a short period of time. This has caused large losses for initial supporters in projects such as $SUSHI and $STRONG.\n\nAt Bundles, we are creating an innovative staking platform that allows token holders to potentially earn high levels of APY (if they outperform the average prediction bundle) yet the token supply remains the same.\n\nTotal supply 100,000 $BUND\n\nPrivate Sale 15,000 $BUND (already completed at 0.002 ETH per $BUND and released upon completion of the presale)\n\nPresale 55,000 $BUND (0.003 ETH per $BUND)\n\nAirdrop 5,000 $BUND (released 7 days after Uniswap listing) ANNOUNCEMENT ON HOW TO RECEIVE THE AIRDROP 20th OCTOBER\n\nTeam tokens 10,000 $BUND\n\nMarketing tokens 5,000 $BUND (we have some great marketing ideas!)\n\nUniswap Liquidity 10,000 $BUND (LOCKED LIQUIDITY)\n\nThe Presale will be a fixed swap sale on bounce.finance and will be launching before the end of October.\n\nFollowing the completion of the presale, we will list the token on Uniswap within 24 hours. The initial listing price will be 0.005 ETH per $BUND.\n\nInitial Market Cap of 425 ETH ($158,525 on current ETH price)\"\n\nTheir platform is launching tomorrow. So, **how does it work?** Users stake their desired amount of $bund and choose a \"bundle\" of assets they think will perform well over the next week. You can currently choose from BTC, ETH, XRP, UNI, LINK, DOT, USDT, BNB, YFI and CORE, (but they will let the community vote on new tokens and how many pools there should be), and then you wait a week to see how well your asset bundle performs. The point is to choose a bundle you think performs great during the next week.\n\nNow, once the contest is over users are rewarded based on how they did. There are 9 tiers with different rewards:\n\nTop 10% of predictions +3.6% (4% minus 10% Developer fee)\n\n10\u201320% +2.7% (3% minus 10% Developer fee)\n\n20\u201330% +1.8% (2% minus 10% Developer fee)\n\n30\u201340% +0.9% (1% minus 10% Developer fee)\n\n40\u201360% NEUTRAL\n\n60\u201370% -1%\n\n70\u201380% -2%\n\n80\u201390% -3%\n\n90\u2013100% -4%\n\nSo if you're in the top 10% you get a reward of 3.6% from the bottom tier (people who lost bundles). This is where I think it's so interesting - using a contest for staking. It's like DFS but for Crypto, and this is why I think it will get huge (plus they're going to add other use cases for the platform).\n\n**Some positive points:**\n\nThe team is known (Simon Lewis & Sid Bouziane) and are constantly interacting with/updating the community.\n\nThe community is growing FAST. Organically we have gone from (when I joined) 170 holders to 375, and like 800 in the TG to 1400.\n\nThe owners started Elevate Health in 2018 and got VC funding from it. Simon's background is in financial broking.\n\nSuccessfully audited by Solidity.\n\nPlatform releasing tomorrow.\n\nThe largest holder of Bund is the same address that's the largest holder of K3pr which is leading to theories that it may be Andre Cronje or a friend of his.\n\nThe top 10 wallets (whales) got in under $1. We have been over $15 twice now and touched $22 and they still haven't sold, which leads me to believe they think this is going much, much higher, and will probably be involved in the staking contests.\n\nIf you're interested in checking this out here's their Twitter: [http://twitter.com/BundlesFinance](http://twitter.com/BundlesFinance)\n\nThis links their Telegram (where all the action is). And you can find a bunch of posts on their Medium account.\n\nI'm hoping to hear some feedback from you people. Its gone to 1.2 mil cap without any marketing and their site not out yet (tomorrow), plus it's not on CMC or CG yet. This is a super unknown project. They have two AMAs ready to go by Wednesday and one is in a TG group with over 20,000 people. I saw on their etherscan that they've sent out 10 transaction from their financial account, so they have at least 10 amas/influencers lined up for marketing to begin.\n\nI personally think this will get huge because of the gamification aspect. People love to gamble. Whales will love the contests as a way for them to earn with their TA. It makes Crypto exciting while earning and I think it will spread like fire once the Twitter big dogs find out about the platform and how it works.\n\nAnyway, let me know what you guys think of it. I'm stoked on the idea, but would love to get some input.",

It works quite simply: you pick a coin to lend, pick a smart contract, and enter the amount you wish to lend. Your crypto is then deployed directly to the smart contract to start earning interest. Once you\u2019ve loaned out your crypto through the app you can watch your interest grow. The earning interest rates up to 9%.\n\nWhat is the most relevant option to raise the first capital?

            "text": "As the popularity of cryptocurrencies is increasing with every year, more and more scammers appear around it. Therefore, it is very important to protect yourself from any kind of fraud in the crypto world. Here are the most popular ways of Bitcoin scams and our tips on how to avoid them. Forewarned is forearmed!\n\n**1. Pyramid (or Ponzi) schemes**\n\nIn this case, users can be lured by promises of incredibly high profits at extremely low investments. Here\u2019s how a classical pyramid scheme works: the first investors attract new people from which receive profiteering. And when the flow of the new investors falls, the pyramid collapses.\n\nHow not to fall for a pyramid scam:\n\n* Watch out when project organizers guarantee that \"you will not lose money\" or rush you with the words: \u201cYou need to invest as fast as possible, otherwise it will be too late\u201d.\n* Beware of crypto projects that push you to recruit new investors to benefit from bigger profits.\n* Do not believe a proposal that promises returns that sound too good to be true.\n\n**2. Scams with fake wallets and exchangers**\n\nHere we are talking about fraudulent sites. Some pretend to be Bitcoin wallets, some look like exchanges, some are kind of both at once. Usually, sometime after registration, they work normally to put off your guard and earn trust. You peacefully deposit your crypto, the funds in the account accumulate \u2014 and the scammers vanish with your currency.\n\nHow not to fall for a scam:\n\n* Go for well-reputed and popular exchanges and wallets.\n* Try to verify the information about the selected exchange or wallet: explore the creators and their team, read the feedback in authoritative publications, websites, and forums.\n* Be cautious of just created exchanges, wallets, apps, and browser extensions.\n* Download apps and software from legal wallet providers and exchanges.\n\n**3. Cloud mining**\n\nThe mining process requires good and expensive computer equipment, so some people offer \u201cmining for rent\u201d on their equipment. There are some legal cloud mining services that let users rent server space to mine coins. On the other hand, there are also plenty of cloud mining scams out there.\n\nHow not to fall for a mining scam and be sure that service is legitimate:\n\n* Research before signing in and try to find the answers to the following questions: Is it possible to find legal information about the creators and the team? How long does a company exist? What computing power do they have? What kind of deposit and withdrawal methods do they offer?\n* Priority should be given to a service, which is transparent and public. Check out its photos, blogs, videos with equipment and employees. Read reviews from users on which you can rely on.\n\n**4. Malware**\n\nThis type of fraud has long been a weapon in the armory of online scammers. Malware in a crypto world is created to get access to your wallet and drain your account, monitor the Windows clipboard for crypto addresses and swap your valid address with an address of a scammer.\n\nHow not to fall for malware scams:\n\n* Regularly update antivirus software.\n* Under no circumstances do not download and install programs if not 100% sure they\u2019re from a legal provider.\n* Don\u2019t open suspicious attachments.\n\n**5. Phishing**\n\nThe typical phishing scheme is extremely simple. The scammer sends the user an e-mail from the so-called crypto exchange or wallet provider in which the lurcher places a link to the fake website. The main goal is to force the user to go to the fake page and enter personal data (username, password, private key and so on). This confidential information allows theft to access the original website on behalf of the real user and walk away with the user\u2019s currency.\n\nHow not to fall for phishing scams:\n\n* Always carefully check all the links. Do not click on links from the messages from Internet services \u2014 instead, manually enter the address of the desired service in the address bar of your browser.\n* Never reveal your private key.\n* Use antivirus which has special protection against phishing.\n\nYou should remember that the risks of scam and speculations are everywhere. Make reasonable investments and never take big risks. And finally, guards up by following our pieces of advice.\n\nLike and share this article if you find it useful.

First off, I'm not a dev or in anyway affiliated with the Sigil team, I'm just a humble miner / investor who feels this new project - in a world of endless ICO's and P&D's - deserves a bit of spotlight.\n\nAs it says in the title, the Sigil team are developing a new crowd-sourcing platform, upon which the Sigil coin will be used as currency. I make a habit of scouring and investigating as many new crypto's as possible (I used to have free time, I used to go to the gym, I used to see friends, thank god all that is in the past) \n\nWhat struck me in particular about this project was how polished it all was at launch. A really well put together whitepaper, 3 working wallets and pools already organised, gave a really good first impression. More than that, you can clearly see that this project has a USP, not just another half-baked get rich quick scheme or a we-promise-you-the-earth-please-give-money ICO. It's PoW/PoS and a pretty sizeable lump of coins have been set-aside to fund an ongoing bounty campaign, which I think looks pretty generous. \n\nAll-in-all I think it looks like a good bet. You can never know for sure with crypto's - especially when fresh off the printer - but, for me, Sigil has all the hallmarks of a future big-hitter. And anyway, without all the other crap to wade-through, where would the fun be in unearthing the odd gem? \n\nHope you guys give it a look, to the moon please drive.\n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2710157.0",

These seven blockchains are redefining their image this year. \n\n# NEM & Symbol\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s967yfs2tjk51.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=68a043ba27d676a60414b83f45f60862e7bb50f3\n\nNEM is planning to launch a new blockchain called Symbol this year.  The Singapore-based platform was quite popular in its early days but has  since been overtaken by its more popular competitors. This rebrand  gives it a chance to reinvent itself.\n\nSymbol is version 2.0 of the NEM blockchain, with several new  features and an increased emphasis on enterprise applications. The  project has also launched a community-based [peer marketing platform](https://cryptobriefing.com/nem-attempts-revive-project-new-social-media-platform/) with crypto rewards as part of the upgrade.\n\nUsers who hold the NEM blockchain token (XEM) will receive tokens for  the Symbol blockchain (XYM) as part of a free airdrop. Dates have not  yet been announced.\n\n# Ethereum\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6nfkxn6tjk51.png?width=662&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f4830878d7e5c75a44b628a343d0a5aee922af6\n\nEthereum rebranded its website this month, offering fresh illustrations from [Dogecoin doges](https://www.bitrates.com/news/p/every-doge-has-its-day-what-has-dogecoin-been-up-to) to bazaar shoppers and the concept of [\"building with money legos.\"](https://medium.com/totle/building-with-money-legos-ab63a58ae764)\n\nThe site has also been restructured. \"We\u2019ve been adding more  information to these pages, making them feel less like a \u201cGithub  README\u201d, and adding helpful features,\" the Ethereum team says. The site  is also pointing users to wallets, exchanges, and other useful services  tailored to their local area.  \n\n\n[Ethereum 2.0](https://www.bitrates.com/news/p/examining-ethereum-20-this-is-not-your-grannys-blockchain)  should introduce staking rewards to general users by November, meaning  that onboarding new users through branding is an important marketing  move.\n\n# Cardano\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jcf1813atjk51.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=b88cd46aba903f8c0fca4175c32781d1d04ae844\n\nThe Cardano Foundation has renovated its website as part of \"Project  Renovare.\" The redesign was carried out in collaboration with the brand  agency McCann Dublin.   \n\n\nBakyt Azimkanov of the Cardano Foundation  says that the site's new image is meant to reflect upcoming Cardano  features, such as smart contracts and enterprise solutions. \"Branding is  vital in driving value and attracting corporate adopters to the Cardano  ecosystem,\" he stated in a recent press release.\n\nLike Ethereum, Cardano is also introducing staking rewards. In fact,  it launched staking last week, allowing users to earn rewards by  investing their ADA tokens.\n\n# Facebook's Calibra Wallet\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tineudbdtjk51.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb4fc5291d15d4cbd76c156697dac3138a0638c2\n\n Facebook has renamed the wallet software related to its [Libra cryptocurrency](https://www.bitrates.com/news/p/facebooks-libra-is-it-really-all-its-cracked-up-to-be).\n\nFacebook says that it renamed the wallet in order to distinguish it  from its related blockchain and prevent confusion. The wallet,  previously known as Calibra, is now called \"Novi.\" Libra itself,  Facebook's blockchain project, is still called \"Libra.\"\n\nGiven that Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency has continually been  delayed, and given that the Novi wallet is not yet available, the  rebrand may not generate much hype.\n\nTo view the whole list read it [here](https://www.bitrates.com/news/p/crypto-rebrands-seven-projects-that-are-undergoing-redesigns-this-year).",

I bought some LTE, XLM, and BTC to diversify, but then I realized that it is probably not super safe to keep my crypto in Coinbase, so I set up an Exodus account and planned on moving it there. When I was about to make the transaction, I saw how much the transaction fees were and I didn't know if it would be worth it or not. Like if I only have \\~25 dollars of BTC, I don't want to be losing 5 of those dollars on transferring it to my wallet, and another 5 when inevitably I move it back to Coinbase to sell. So I was wondering, whats the best way to go about this? \n\nShould I put all of my equity into a coin like USDC, move it to Exodus, and then convert it all back to their respective coins? Or do I just keep it in my Coinbase account (my ETH had been sitting in there for \\~2 years and it was never stolen, I have 2FA enabled, and Coinbase has an insurance policy IIRC, so it doesn't seem that bad)? Or do I just tank the fees and move it to Exodus normally?",

But that doesn't work for Exodus as their built-in exchanges require a very high minimum (for our purposes of ~$25), as well as it being pricey (again ETH-based stuff). Usually just ETH, ERC 20 coins and tokens are the issue. The problem is, anything Eth based, and now btc right now as well is getting prohibitively expensive to do anything with. You really have two options: wait for ETH 2.0, or eat the current costs, most unfortunately.",

Whats important to you when it comes to poker brands and crypto-currencies.\n\nFor example:\nMinimum deposit & withdrawal amount - In your opinion (and to keep it fair) what do you suggest the minimum withdrawal and deposit amount should be?\nWhat should be the max withdrawal time?\nWhat currency should be used in a crypto-poker room? mBTC?\nLicenses?\nAnonymity?\nAny other suggestions and remarks can be extremely useful.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlittle bit about what were doing.\n\nWe've created a new poker room. Using an already existing poker software, our developers have added some new and exciting features as well as a completely new UI.\n\nOur features - \nRakeback-Per-Session: If your familiar with poker from fiat poker brands than you've probably heard of rakeback. Our brand lets you view live on your table, the rakeback you have generated per session on your table Rakeback will be allocated back to your poker wallet the very next day!\n\nUBPlay: This is our own unique take on PLAY MONEY. Similar to Zynga poker and other poker communities you may find on facebook, UBPlay allows our players to top up a PLAY MODE faucet of 500 chips (with a value of 500 satoshis) once every 6 hours. Play tourneys/cash games or sit&goes. Use your play chips to buy UBTickets and once you have enough, come join our real UBEvents with real cash (bitcoin) prizes \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf your interested in seeing what the poker room will look like you can follow our post on bitcointalk here:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2069122.0\n\nHere you can find what our final table on a tournament will look like as well as our cashier and lobby.\n\nThank you and hoping to hear from all of you soon.",

XEM holders should  prepare for a blockchain snapshot to  receive a 1-for-1 allocation of  the new XYM token on Symbol.\n\nThe [NEM Group](https://nem.io/) has begun the opt-in process to[ Symbol](https://symbolplatform.com/),   the next-generation enterprise-grade blockchain solution that replaces   the original NEM blockchain. The first step of the migration from NEM   NIS1, NEM\u2019s original blockchain platform, to the new Symbol public  chain  will be introduced in parallel with NIS1. To ensure existing NIS1  users  can continue to run their applications as usual, the two chains  will  operate side-by-side.\n\nDavid  Shaw, CEO of NEM Group, says the opt-in process is a critical  part of  the migration process and an essential step on the roadmap to  the  launch of Symbol. \u201cOur team has built a robust platform, taking the   learnings from building NEM NIS1 in addition to advancements in the   industry and feature set ideas to develop Symbol.\u201d Shaw says Symbol was   built from the ground up to be secure, scalable, and decentralized,  with  enterprise applications at its core. \u201cNIS1 users who choose to  opt-in  now will be among the first to experience all of Symbol\u2019s  capabilities  following the mainnet launch,\u201d he says.\n\n# The XEM / XYM snapshot\n\nAn important component of the migration to the new Symbol chain is that all holders of [XEM](https://bravenewcoin.com/data-and-charts/assets/XEM/price-summary),   NEM NIS1\u2019s native crypto asset, are eligible to receive XYM tokens on   Symbol when it launches later this year. XEM holders who choose to   opt-in will obtain an XYM balance equal to their XEM balance at the time   of the snapshot, a timestamp when user balances in XEM on the NEM   blockchain will be recorded. This snapshot, a record of all XEM account   balances on the NEM NIS1 blockchain, will be taken in early December   2020.\n\nXYM will be allocated based  on each user\u2019s on-chain XEM balance. The  NEM team recommends that users  move XEM off exchanges and into the  official NEM Wallet. The NEM  Wallet has been updated to include a Symbol  Opt-in module, which will  make it simple to opt-in via your NEM  account. XEM account holders are  able to opt-in to claim their XYM  tokens at Snapshot. NEM has published  a [detailed guide](https://nemplatform.com/symbol-migration/) to using the wallet during the opt-in process to receive the new XYM tokens.\n\nFor  each 1 XEM held by users at the time of Snapshot, they will  receive 1  XYM  (1 XEM = 1 XYM). All XYM allocations will be based on  this  one-time record of XEM balances, so XYM allocations for opt-in will  be  based on the amount of XEM users hold during the Snapshot.\n\n# What is NEM\u2019s Symbol?\n\n[Symbol](https://symbolplatform.com/)  is a  next-generation blockchain solution designed for enterprise use.  Symbol  (codename Catapult) represents a full rewrite of the NEM  protocol and  has been in development since 2018. Symbol is designed to  help  businesses cut costs, reduce complexities, and streamline  innovation.  Symbol is expected to provide significant upgrades in  flexibility,  security, speed, and ease of use over the original NEM  blockchain.\n\nIain Wilson, Chief  Financial Officer of NEM Group, says Symbol  represents the start of  NEM\u2019s next chapter, describing it as a  purpose-built solution to help  companies experience the business  benefits of blockchain. \u201cWe want our  community to be part of this  process, by opting-in, participating in  the snapshot and helping to  continue to tell the NEM story as we  continue to drive innovation, build  the NEM ecosystem and develop  Symbol into the go-to blockchain solution  for enterprise.\u201d\n\nOpt-in is now open via the[ desktop wallet](https://nemplatform.com/symbol-migration), with mobile versions (Google Play and iOS) launching soon.\n\n[Source](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/nem-news)",

            "text": "The Bitcoin exchange rate faced a significant drop not a long time ago, so a lot of miners think that mining this coin is not as profitable as before. However, Bitcoin is stabilizing, so now is the time to start mining it again. And, definitely, it is better to do this with reliable and efficient software.\n\nThere are a lot of operating systems for managing Bitcoin mining, so making a final choice can be a rather complicated task. This guide is here to help you \u2014 it describes features, advantages and disadvantages of the most popular software. \n\n## Hive OS: an all-in-one solution\n\n[Hive OS](https://hiveos.farm/) is a highly secure and stable mining platform based on the Linux distribution of Ubuntu. Besides, you will have no difficulties with its installation, setup and use. However, if you have any questions, you can always get in touch with the support team. The support is provided 24/7, so you will get help very quickly. There is also an extensive knowledge base that you can use.\n\nHive OS significantly simplifies even large farms\u2019 management. A lot of things can be automated. For instance, automatic control of the fans, execution of commands according to the schedule, etc. Apart from this, switching between pools, wallets or coins takes only a second. The list of miners is updated regularly, just like the list of features \u2014 the Hive OS team is constantly working on the system considering the needs of the community. With Hive OS it is also possible to control the workers remotely.\n\nHive OS allows mining Bitcoin on ASICs and GPU rigs, offers its own [pool](https://hiveon.net/) and custom [firmware for ASICs](https://hiveos.farm/asic/). It is an all-in-one solution that you can use in order to make the management process simpler and increase your profits.\n\n## \u0421GMiner: suitable for experienced owners of AMD cards\n\n[CGMiner](https://github.com/ckolivas/cgminer) is an open-source miner focused specifically on mining Bitcoin (although some other coins can also be mined here). It supports GPU, ASIC and CPU mining, and is available for the following platforms: Windows, Linux and OS X. While using all the traditional features (for instance, overclocking) you won\u2019t have to pay a dev fee.\n\nHowever, this miner is not that suitable for inexperienced users \u2014 you at least need to have some knowledge of GitHub. Another thing to keep in mind is that CGMiner doesn\u2019t work well with Nvidia cards. \n\n## Cudo Miner: a nice option for beginners \n\n[Cudo Miner](https://www.cudominer.com/) is a simple to use crypto mining platform. Remote management, monitoring and overclocking \u2014 these and other standard features are available. Cudo Miner also offers automated mining and auto coin switching. Besides, if necessary, you can create custom templates in order to increase performance of your devices.\n\nOn the other side, Cudo Miner doesn\u2019t support ASICs. One more unpleasant thing is that the fees are based on the amount of cryptocurrency mined in the last 30 days, and they are pretty high. For example, for less than 0.005 BTC, the fee is 6.5%.\n\n## SimpleMining: the choice of GPU owners \n\n[SimpleMining](https://simplemining.net/) is a mining OS platform supporting all modern Nvidia and AMD GPUs. Using it, you can take bulk actions on multiple devices. Standard features like overclocking and undervolting are available as well. Besides, there are a lot of miner programmes to choose from, but you can still add a custom miner if necessary. But please keep in mind that it is impossible to mix AMD and Nvidia in one rig. \n\n## Hashr8: for users who know everything about mining\n\n[Hashr8](http://os.hashr8.com/) is an operating system suitable both for ASICs and GPU rigs. The system also supports many pools and miners. You can monitor devices not only in the web interface, but also via the mobile application. Support is provided around the clock. Besides, Hashr8 can be used for free \u2014 this option is available to miners using up to 3 devices inclusive. At the same time, there are no other restrictions \u2014 free users can use all the functions of the system.\n\nHowever, despite the above-mentioned benefits, Hashr8 also has some disadvantages. Firstly, you can contact the support team only using the form on the website or by email, so there is no chance for getting help instantly. The website also has no FAQ, so if you run into a problem, you are likely to have to solve it yourself. Secondly, Hashr8 is a rather unstable system, which can affect your income.\n\n## Awesome Miner: suitable for centralized mining management\n\n[Awesome Miner](https://www.awesomeminer.com/) allows managing and monitoring the mining operations, and supports ASICs and GPU rigs (CPU mining is possible too). Using it, you can perform operations both on individual miners and the groups, and build templates for easier configuration. Note that Awesome Miner can be used for free, but on certain conditions: you can have up to 2 miners, while the list of available features is rather limited.\n\nAwesome Miner runs only on Windows, but you can still connect it to mining software running on Linux. Apart from this, it can be difficult for a new user to understand how this solution works, as its interface is not that convenient and intuitive.\n\n## What Software to Choose?\n\nObviously, the final decision completely depends on your needs, but we recommend choosing a universal system that supports GPU rigs and ASICs. By doing this, you will have freedom of action. A similar recommendation can be applied to GPU rigs \u2014 if you prefer them, choose a system that works both with Nvidia and AMD cards. \n\nMake your choice wisely, and have profitable Bitcoin mining!",

            "text": "If you'll find this helpful, please sign up using my invitation link: https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=E3sJ60\n\nQuick disclosure, nothing in this article should be considered as financial advice, this is purely my opinion and my research alone, take it with a grain of salt.\n\nIt\u2019s an up-and-coming cryptoexchange that is like an integration of COSS and Binance. The problem with COSS is that there is little incentive for investors to use it, the UI is lackluster, it lacks proper charting tools, the previous CEO was known to be part of pyramid schemes. Binance, a similar Hongkong exchange is something that we can also compare KCS to, the BNB token offers the utility to reduce fees, but again there\u2019s little incentive to actually have BNB tokens are use the Binanance exchange. I elaborate further on the advantages the Kucoin will have over other exchanges.\n\nKucoin has similarities to COSS in that 50% of fees that they charge are returned to the holders of KCS everyday at 12am. Holders of KCS get access to other perks such as trading fee discounts similar to BNB, customer-service fast passes and more. I also need to highlight that the 100m that is being with-held for 4 years and 30m of which is locked up for 2 years belonging to the founders/investors respectively ARE NOT subject to the 50% re-compensation of fees which normal traders/investors earn. Which means that only the current 100m supply for the next 4 years is eligible to receive the *dividends* from KCS.\n\nKucoin has a long-term goal of becoming a decentralized exchange(DEX) or integrating as much of it as they possibly can within their ecosystem, a point that I\u2019d really like to highlight is that recently there has been a lot of news/FUD around exchanges like Bittrex and Bitfinex banning users, Finex have already disabled US citizens access to trading on their platform, and Bittrex is a US exchange, so who knows when they\u2019ll have to close their doors to US citizens, they\u2019ve even gone so far as to ban people from middle-eastern nations, however decentralized exchanges are on-chain and there is no governance or need to store funds on centralized exchanges to risk being hacked, as well as lawmaking bodies having no jurisdiction over them. There are currently withdrawal limits on accounts but the developers will be removing those very shortly, Kucoin has extremely fast transfer times with lower amounts of confirmations for speedy deposit/withdrawal, low transaction fees of 0.1% with special events where some coins are free to trade, such as WTC/HSR as of now.\n\nThe user interface is amazing compared to most exchanges out there, they enable trading view charting which is much better for traders to use compared to charts such as on Bittrex or Binance which have a very limited selection of charting tools, there are some kinks on the website such as the orderbook, however I have had a talk with the developers and they said that they were looking for \u201cmore elegant ways\u201d to display the orderbook than just a scrollbar, they were also looking into producing a nightmode which is a god-send for night-dwelling (night-traders).\n\nThe Kucoin team are extremely active and have nearly 24/7 support, you can go into their telegram and ask them any question and they\u2019ll answer you hastily and earnestly.\n\nThey also have an invitation bonus which is as a referral compensation program, basically for every person that YOU invite, you get 20% of the trading fees of the person you invited as an INCOME, and then 12% of the trading fees of the people that they invite. (I know you think that this reeks of a pyramid-scheme, however, I need to highlight that the KCS team do NOT benefit at all from this referral program as they actually LOSE money if OTHER people/users are using these referrals.) It is an attempt to bring more volume and traffic, but traders/investors only stand to gain from this, we have absolutely nothing to lose, the more friends you invite the more income you can have. (Some people are calling this a pyramid scheme, however it\u2019s simply a marketing tool, I brush up on this in the second half of the article)\n\nRight now, KCS is flying under the radar, it hasn\u2019t even been added to CMC yet (they are getting it added very soon) and once it does we do expect to see a lot of hype, there will be a very huge in-flux of traders who would come to the exchange, I see this as the death of COSS, no one will go back once they try out KCS.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the valuation of KCS, currently there is 200m supply cap, eventually over a long period of time the KCS team will buyback KCS (optional to sell to them) with the profits made from trading fees to the burn the supply until there is only 100m left, don\u2019t be alarmed by this, there won\u2019t be a sudden supply restriction of 100m over one night, its something that will probably take a decade to achieve, if not even longer. Who knows for sure, right so moving on; KCS is currently valued at approximately $0.6USD at 200m supply thats around $54m USD market cap. It\u2019s only been out for under a month and the ICO price was $0.3USD(5000 satoshis) or around there, so it has doubled and a medium-high marketcap of $54m but lets compare the price to Binance, which is currently $1.27 through all of the FUD/FOMO on Bitcoin/bitcoin gold/2x. Token supply of 200m like, similar to KCS, was valued at its peak approximately $2.58 per BNB reaching a total market cap of around $270m, and it doesn\u2019t even have the same features as KCS. So, KCS is currently valued at $0.6USD, with all of its amazing features, team, dividend payout, referral program; I believe has the potential to grow even larger and maintain its price. If not more. I do see this as a huge long-term project, it\u2019s the mainstream exchange killer, it\u2019s like the oneplus versus Apple and Samsung, if we actually evaluate the coin and the Kucoin exchange itself within its ecosystem it has nearly unlimited potential.\n\nOne of the common misconceptions and concerns is that traders have is, is Kucoin a MLM/Pyramid scheme?\n\nWhat we have here is one of the posters on their website promoting an invitation/referral compensation program. The initial impact of the image makes one think that it is a pyramid scheme, but if you actually look closely you\u2019ll understand that in actual fact Kucoin themselves don\u2019t really benefit at all, they\u2019re giving 90% of all of their fees to the referee as compensation while they only take 10%. This isn\u2019t a pyramid scheme or some shady MLM, it\u2019s a marketing tool to attract more traders and liquidity to the market. The only people who really benefit are the traders.\n\nGetting straight to the point, it has a picture of a pyramid, but it isn\u2019t a pyramid scheme. I need to highlight that the referral system is completely optional, you don\u2019t need to invite anyone or spam your link, I understand that it does get annoying for people. It is a marketing plan aimed at being a liquidity attraction tool to try to hook more traders into using the exchange, but people are so stigmatized to the shape of pyramids that they fail to see the truth behind the curtains.\n\nI\u2019d like to go through the business model and ecosystem of exchanges, and as objectively as I can compare the difference between each exchange.\n\nSo for this example I\u2019ll use 3 exchanges:\n\nA. Bittrex\n\nB. Kucoin\n\nC. GDAX\n\nI\u2019d like to make a fair evaluation of these exchanges based on three things.\n\n1. Trading fees\n\n2. User friendliness\n\n3. Trading tools.\n\nFirst, some more assumptions Kucoin is still in its early stages of launching as an exchange, I\u2019ve talked to the developers and they will be adding in \u201cmore elegant ways to see the orderbook\u201d and stoploss/take profit systems.\n\n5-point evaluation: very good, good, mediocre, bad, very bad.\n\nA. 1. Mediocre-Bad (0.25%) 2. Good 3. Mediocre-good.\n\nB. 1. Very good (0.1%) 2. Good 3. Good\n\nC. 1. Mediocre-Bad (0.25%) 2. Good. 3. Mediocre\n\nSome other underlying assumptions are that each exchange has the same amount of trading volume daily; $100m. Each have the same variety of coins listed.\n\nGiven that information, which exchange would you personally as a trader gravitate towards; try to be as subjective as possible. If my evaluations are wrong, let me know and I will amend them.\n\nYou would inherently choose B. Correct? There is a recurring argument that the token offers no utility, the truth in the fact is that very few tokens offers anything at all, BTC is simply a speculative asset with no intrinsic value, and that\u2019s it. I haven\u2019t introduced the token dynamic just yet, so hold up.\n\nGoing back to the MLM/Pyramid scheme aspect of it. For something to be a pyramid scheme it has to have an initial buy-in where the grunts at the bottom purchase a product, and it has to directly benefit the upper echelons id est the developers/the exchange.\n\nDoes Kucoin meet any of those requirements? Not really. The referral program doesn\u2019t require anything, you don\u2019t need to hold Kucoin to be eligible for the 20% of fees that you\u2019re earning from people you invite. It\u2019s completely optional with no buy in, no product to sell. You can just use the exchange, or even invite people to get the referral bonus, then forget about it, and as they trade on the exchange you earn a % of those transaction fees passively. In fact, the Kucoin team loses from this marketing. Because they\u2019re essentially giving a cut of the fees which they should earn back to its traders. Bittrex/GDAX don\u2019t offer anything at all, they simply take 100% of all fees they have and put it in their pockets.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nA. Bittrex pockets all transaction fees it earns from traders on its exchange without any compensation to traders.\n\nB. Kucoin offers an optional referral promotion whereby referees earn a % of fees that are incurred by the referred to the referee as compensation to help bring more liquidity to the exchange. This is actually detrimental to kucoin as they earn less income from transaction fees by giving it to the referees.\n\nC. GDAX pockets all transaction fees it earns from traders on its exchange without any compensation to its traders.\n\nIf you believe that this statement is incorrect, or overly subjective please speak out.\n\nNow, the issue with the token. Some people are saying that it has no utility; I\u2019m going to prove that it does have utility.\n\nA. Bittrex does not offer a utility token which reduces fees, or returns any portion of their income to traders. Of $100m trading volume they pocket $250K a day.\n\nB. Of all Kucoin token holders, 50% of all transaction fees earned by the exchange are transferred nightly at 12AM to Kucoin token holders. Of $100m daily trading volume they pocket $50k, while the other $50k is transferred to its token holders.\n\nC. GDAX does not offer a utility token which reduces fees, or returns any portion of their income to traders. Of $100m trading volume they pocket up to $250K a day.\n\nIf there\u2019s a problem with my calculations, please let me know.\n\nNow I need to ask, is there value in holding the token? It is a speculative asset, which provides utility in generating returns for the holders of the token on the exchange. As far as tokens/coins go I\u2019m fairly certain that this token has utility, it doesn\u2019t just offer a cut of the 50% of daily trading volume as income but can also act eventually as fee discounts similar to BNB, as well as simply holding it will grant you support-fast access(Give that their support team is already very fast, that\u2019s something to consider).\n\nThere is also no inherent need for the token, Bittrex/GDAX are already largely successful even without utility tokens, so why is Kucoin going out of their way to even lose up to 50% of their income?\n\nThe answer lies in liquidity, and competition; the utility token, the referral compensation system, they are all liquidity attraction tools. Exchanges make money based off how much transaction fees they can incur through the amount of daily trading. How does a new exchange compete with big wigs like Bittrex/GDAX? These are huge giants who have been in the game for a long time, but they\u2019re some-what obsolete. They\u2019re greedy and only care about themselves, have horrible customer-service and poor communication within their community. Kucoin offers more than that, you can go talk to its active development team in their telegram, bombard them with any stupid question you like, and they will respond.\n\nThe token, the referral system are liquidity attraction tools, even if they only get 50% of all trading fees as income, if they can attract more liquidity than other exchanges and become competitive they can also be big, furthermore we as investors holding the token don\u2019t lose anything at all, in fact we get a cut of the 50% of the trading fees they earn. I\u2019ve already received my first dividend last night at 12am, it was basically nothing but that is considering that they only have a trading volume of $1.1m a day approximately, if not less. If that was $300m, the number of dividends anyone would get would be 3-fold.\n\nWhat to take away from this; it seems like an MLM/Pyramid scheme on the surface, but the developers do not directly benefit from giving traders a huge cut of their profits, their main goal is liquidity and competition. The token value is also a long-term goal, I should reiterate that there is currently only a total supply of 200m which will over a course of a very long time will be reduced to 100m, but that will be a very long time from now, 100m of the current supply is locked up for 4 years for the team/2 for advisors. As well as, being locked up they aren\u2019t eligible to receive any of the 50% cut of the trading fees until AFTER they are released.\n\nI see this as potential big opportunity, purely because in the future I can see the possibility of this becoming a very competitive exchange within crypto-space. This is without a doubt a shill, I\u2019m not partnered with them or anything, but I felt like I needed to clarify what a pyramid scheme is and the distinction between Kucoin\u2019s marketing model and an actual MLM like Amway.\n\nThe dividend model (50% of trading fees are given to the KCS holders)\n\nI\u2019d like to also go through the dividend model, every night at UTC+8 12AM, they deposit directly into your wallet address your share of the 50% trading fees that they earned from transactions during the day. The current daily trading volume is around $1.1m, if Kucoin can achieve competitiveness and run up next to some of the biggest names; Bittrex with $350m daily trading volume, you can expect that all of the dividends you earn will go up 350x as well. I\u2019d like to also point out that the more popular the coin is the more transactions there are thus; you are always earning income in the most popular coin, no matter what it may be.\n\nMore on the utility of Kucoin (White paper abstract)\n\n   To improve user involvement and exchange vitality, Kucoin is going to award incentive bonus, which equals to 50% of the total trading fees charged by the platform, to users who hold KCS in their accounts. Please note that this award proportion could be adjusted based on the actual situation in the future. The initial amount of KCS is 200 million among which 100 million owned by the team and angel investors would not be taken into account when calculating the bonus. In addition, we guarantee that at most 100 million KCS be calculated in the bonus plan during official buy-back and destruction. To obtain the daily bonus, users would need to deposit their KCS into Kucoin Platform. Then the platform will conduct accounting and award bonus based on to the KCS holdings in user\u2019s account at 0:00 (UTC+8) that day and all the trading fees charged to the platform on the previous day.Then the bonus gained by users will directly put to their Kucoin accounts in the corresponding currency. For instance, If ETH-BTC cryptocurrency pair rate is 0.063 on the platform and the daily exchange volume is 30,000 BTC; based on the 0.1% rate from each side, the platform shall charge 30 BTC and 476 ETH as trading fees. The bonus for every 10,000 holdings would be 10,000 by 100,000,000 (0.01%). So that the daily bonus from this very cryptocurrency pair is 0.003 BTC and 0.0476 ETH (1 BTC and 17 ETH annually). Please note that this is ONLY the ETH-BTC exchange pair BONUS. Other than ETH-BTC, there are still various cryptocurrency pairs on the platform, which creates the trading fees in the corresponding currency and bonus based on the description above.\n\n    TRADING FEE DISCOUNT When placing orders to trade, holding a certain amount of KCS in Kucoin account can lower the trading fee. Details will be published through announcements.\n\n    OTHER EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS When KCS holding reaches certain levels, users can enjoy special services like one-on-one investment consultation, customer service Fast-Pass, etc.\n\nFull transcript of my Q&A with the Operation Director Kent Li\n\nTwo concerns were put fourth by some of my readers;\n\n    How do we know that we are actually receiving the 50% that you are guaranteeing us?\n    In the whitepaper it is stated that the 50% of trading fees traders on the platform will earn is subject to change, what is the reasoning behind this?\n\n    Kent Li\u200a\u2014\u200aKucoin\u200a\u2014\u200aOperation Director, [22.10.17 00:35]\n    Firstly, the users are actually getting 50%. The trading volume of each pair is transparent, people can get the data from the web page or through our public API endpoints. So there\u2019s nowhere to hide if we cheated on this, people can easily calculate their Kucoin Bonus based on the formula we described in the whitepaper.\n\n    Kent Li\u200a\u2014\u200aKucoin\u200a\u2014\u200aOperation Director, [22.10.17 00:39]\n    Secondly, many people have discussed our referral system. The reason why we design is like what you have said, to attract more people to come trade on Kucoin. Because we\u2019re new comers in this industry even in China, we have to do everything to attract new users and become competitive in the space, that\u2019s why we share 90% of our trading fees to the users. We want to survive. And we are working our asses off to achieve this.\n\n    USER, [22.10.17 01:15]\n    Thanks for that clarification! I\u2019d also like to inquire about the rate of dividends that investors earn, currently it is at 50% and in the whitepaper has been stated that it will be subject to change, how long is the 50% bonus going to last? Some of my readers had told me that it will only be for around 6 months, you intend on reducing the income as your exchange becomes more popular correct?\n\n    USER, [22.10.17 01:16]\n    Also, what is the purpose of the income page in the \u201cAssets\u201d menu, currently all fields are blank, what are your plans for that?\n\n    Kent Li\u200a\u2014\u200aKucoin\u200a\u2014\u200aOperation Director, [22.10.17 01:18]\n    Hi, we do have a plan to reduce the ratio of Kucoin Bonus. It will stay at 50% for at least 6 months, and it will be adjusted gradually, eventually it will be 15% after two or three years. As you know building and maintaining a high volume exchange will cost a lot of money. \u201cIncome\u201d currently contains the GAS reward if you hold NEO on Kucoin, Income is also passive revenue if users hold certain kind of asset on Kucoin.\n\n    USER, [22.10.17 01:19]\n    In regards to the calculation in the white paper, it may also be beneficial to have a dividends tab in the assets page to show users how their dividends are being earned and the calculation behind. (I understand that this is a lot of work, and you guys are extremely busy, these things definitely do not get done overnight so do not feel pressured at all)\n\n    Kent Li\u200a\u2014\u200aKucoin\u200a\u2014\u200aOperation Director, [22.10.17 01:20]\n    Ah, actually we have a better plan\n\n    Kent Li\u200a\u2014\u200aKucoin\u200a\u2014\u200aOperation Director, [22.10.17 01:21]\n    There will be a dashboard or report page for users, it will display their profolio on Kucoin, their daily gains & losses, sort of this kind of things\n\n    USER, [22.10.17 01:21]\n    Thank you for that clarification! I\u2019d know like to move onto some suggestions from my readers on the exchange, talking to a great many traders, they all agree that the exchange is better than up to 80% of the exchanges available. It\u2019s intuitive, innovative and user friendly.\n\n    Some points that were brought up were; the non-existence of a \u201cscroll bar\u201d for the order book, which one of your other developers already said you were after more elegant solutions. Others would be including the placement of the chart, some people were saying that it was a little too small.\n\n    USER, [22.10.17 01:22]\n    If you would like to share any plans with me, I would love to include it in my article, and if you could retweet it or pin it on your twitter. I\u2019m sure it will bring a lot of people piece of mind.\n\n    USER, [22.10.17 01:24]\n    It\u2019s definitely understandable that making sudden changes to the UI of the exchange isn\u2019t something to be done over a night, so I\u2019ll definitely highlight that, I think this is just an important step in gaining the trust of the community.\n\n    Kent Li\u200a\u2014\u200aKucoin\u200a\u2014\u200aOperation Director, [22.10.17 01:25]\n    Yeah, things have to done step by step\n\nIf you found this helpful, please sign up using my invitation link: https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=E3sJ60",

            "text": "This is a summary of my experience with eToro. For my use case and experience eToro really sucked. It may not be the case for many people who use it and for whom it worked well but I was extremely dissapointed and thought i would share my experiences with other people. They are advertising everywhere and I am plagued by eToro youtube videos every 10 minutes or so, which is very annoying (googles advertising of things you already used or own).\n\nSo I decided to try eToro a few months ago. I needed to buy bitcoin fast while it was at a low price and had no fiat stored on my exchange accounts, didnt want to wait 1-2 days for a transfer. I opted for eToro for a few reasons:\n\n\\- European company  \n\\- Accepts credit cards (with caveats as I found out later)  \n\\- Low / Transparent fees as advertised in some cases no-fees (not for crypto as i found out)\n\nSounds great so far, I signed up, verified and bought my bitcoin. Its when I started to use the platform and getting to know it, that I found all the things that were wrong with it. Of course it is all in the terms and conditions and endless useless articles on their help pages that often lead nowhere which of course everyone reads before joining ..... yeah right.\n\nIn my defence I am not new here and have a number of exchange accounts I have been doing small trades over the years but am largely a hodler. I was expecting to have somewhat of a similar experience as other exchanges...this turned out to be far from reality.\n\nChallenge 1: WTF is a CFD\n\nIt is bullshit for a clear definition. It is basically paper trades. You do not own any of the assets you have on the platform as it is a Contract For Difference which basically means you are trading the asset only \u201cvirtual\u201d and eToro promise to repay the worth of your contract. Bought for 6k now it is 7k means they owe you 7k (Not in bitcoin). They do allow you to move SOME assets to a non-tradeable wallet (will cover it as a separate challenge). So OK, a pain in the ass but I will go with it, Bitcoin is supported for withdrawal.\n\nChallenge 2: Buy bitcoin with credit card (responsibly, i have cash just needed to secure the buy) and withdraw it\n\nBought bitcoin, around 2k worth, left it on the account as there was good volatility at the time. Did a few trades and made a couple of hundred euros worth of bitcoin on top of what I originally bought..success. Now I am ready to withdraw it to move to my hardware wallet as I was not intending to use eToro for too long. I was not able to withdraw..why?\n\nIf you are on the Bronze level (less than 5k on the account) and you have deposited via Credit Card you CANNOT withdraw! Silver level (5k+) you can only withdraw after the funds have been there for 180 days if i recall correctly, also varies by country. Wait what?! They happily took the credit card payment without giving me a warning and effectively holding my bitcoin hostage?! After cursing and ranting for a few hours I contacted support who have provided me with a workaround. In order to withdraw your bitcoin you must deposit the same amount in FIAT via Bank Transfer (in which case all activities are supported), you can then withdraw the bitcoin to eToro wallet and then withdraw the remaining amount in FIAT. This solution worked but took multiple days.\n\nChallenge 3: Move Bitcoin to Hardware wallet\n\nSo this is probably the biggest catch I have found with this platform comparing to others. eToro doesnt have a wallet, instead it is some kind of a subsidiary called eToroX which is a different app and website but THANKFULLY you can log in with eToro credentials. In order to withdraw you must first move your funds from eToro to eToro Wallet which has a fee of 0.00050000 Bitcoin...OK...but theres a catch. On the eToro platform each time you make a purchase it is an individual open trade which cannot be merged. So you if you bought your coins in multiple trades, say 3 times, you will have to pay this fee for each trade that is open...complete bullshit...and requires MANUAL validation, which means a person from eToro has to approve this transfer, I had to wait for several days.\n\nOk now thats over I want to move it to my ledger form the eToro wallet app. App shows how much I have and what the fee is 0.000138. I have to manually calculate the amount minus the fee and enter it. It worked! No it didnt, there is some kind of a bug in the app which is getting it wrong and not allowing me to send it though. Waiting for a reply from support right now to figure out WTF. Likely some kind of a decimal point difference which probably means i will leave some dust on the platform.\n\nOther things that I didnt like:\n\n\\- Buy/Sell price: there is a clear difference in the buy and sell price. The moment you buy the asset it is no longer worth that amount because the sell price is significantly lower. I guess this is how they collect fees...not very transparent  \n\\- No volume data: Why? A person from eToro acknowledging shortcomings tells me they dont have volume indicators because there is not enough real volume on the exchange and it would not be helpful. (because it is not a full blown exchange many may be used to)  \n\\- The moment you deposit money or go a level up you get assigned an account manager, these vary per level. You get an email from them introducing themselves randomly, I initially thought it was a scam and ignored the emails. They called me, i had an honest conversation with them, this platform sucked for me.  \n\\- Once you transfer to eToro wallet you cant transfer back to eToro trading platform  \n\\- Coins supported by eToro wallet Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin, and XLM....all else is CFD only but they say they are going to add more  \n\\- Copy Portfolio is a great way to lose money and have somebody else to blame for poor choices, if this is what you like, sure i guess\n\nNot everything is bad of course, if you are happy with CFD's and want a single place to trade all these assets like selected crypto and stocks it is a good place to do that, apps are kind of OK. But it definitely was not for me and I would not recommend it to anyone who is a crypto USER",

            "text": "*There\u2019s often a tension in the crypto world between security and convenience. That trade-off is unacceptable if we want these technologies to be widely used. Here\u2019s how Ergo addresses one common and very important issue.*\n\nWe all know that the most secure way to use Bitcoin, or any crypto, is to download a copy of the blockchain and run a full node yourself. That way, every time you or anyone else makes a transaction, your client checks the blockchain to ensure it\u2019s valid. You don\u2019t have to trust anyone else.\n\nA full Bitcoin node checks all the blocks in the blockchain (using headers) and makes sure there are no fraudulent transactions. It\u2019s a very secure way of using crypto \u2013 but there\u2019s a problem. It requires significant bandwidth, storage and processing power. That kind of commodity hardware is expensive, and using a full node to validate and make transactions is in any case unsuitable for mobile devices. This is particularly true for Bitcoin, where the blockchain is over 270 GB and counting.\n\nSPV\n\nSimplified Payment Verification (SPV) is designed to address this problem, as described in the Bitcoin white paper:\n\n* *It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.*\n\nSatoshi notes that this is not a perfect solution, and is vulnerable to an attacker overpowering the network and fooling SPV users.\n\nMoreover, while SPV mode is intended for resource-limited devices, even this \u2018lite\u2019 approach is not always feasible. Ethereum\u2019s headers alone total around 5 GB to download. Thus Ethereum mobile clients do not validate chain validity and so blindly have to trust third parties.\n\nThere are proposals to reduce the requirements for SPV mode by checking just a few random headers, instead of all of them. But it\u2019s hard to do that securely.\n\nEfficient SPV\n\nSeveral years have been spent researching and developing secure protocols that allow for efficient SPV clients. The two best-known and most reliable protocols are NiPoPoWs and FlyClient.\n\nErgo implements NiPoPoWs, or Non-interactive Proof-of-Proof-of-Work. This technology can be explored in full on this dedicated website: [https://nipopows.com](https://nipopows.com/):\n\n* *Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs) are short stand-alone strings that a computer program can inspect to verify that an event happened on a proof-of-work-based blockchain without connecting to the blockchain network and without downloading all block headers. For example, these proofs can illustrate that a cryptocurrency payment was made.*\n* *NIPoPoWs allow very efficient mobile wallets to be created.* *SPV wallets* *are already very lightweight compared to full nodes because they only require the download of block headers, not the whole blockchain. NIPoPoW wallets need to download only a small* ***sample*** *of block headers, around 250, when SPV clients need to download half a million block headers. The sample needed changes but doesn't grow much in size as the blockchain grows larger by the years, even after decades of data has been accumulated.*\n\nThis enables us to build a mobile SPV client that requires around **just 100KB** of block headers to be downloaded.\n\nA super-efficient Ergo wallet with SPV security is in development, so stay tuned for more updates!",

            "text": "Hey! I recently started trading crypto on an exchange and chose the exchange carefully. I decided to prepare for you a list of security points that I paid attention to when choosing an exchange and may be useful to you.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8obyxfcq2em61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7a995f67f6ca26da4f78a75c9326e31c1ce1477\n\nThe popularity of crypto exchanges has led to dozens of new platforms entering the market each year. To date, nearly 300 different platforms offer investors a wide array of choices when it comes to transacting on a crypto currency exchange. Since stolen crypto is often not able to be recovered, the security of an exchange is a major factor dictating how many users adopt the platform. \n\nAs a result, exchanges pursue a variety of measures to keep funds safe from thieves, hackers, and scammers. Here\u2019s a brief list of common cryptocurrency exchange security guidelines. \n\n1. **Cold Wallet Storage**: Seen as the safest way to secure crypto, cold wallet storage keeps funds safe in hardware wallets not connected to the Internet (unlike hot wallets). Some cryptocurrency exchange security protocols directly separate assets in a user\u2019s profile by allocating some money towards cold storage and then prompting a user to move assets to a hot hardware wallet when they are ready to transact. \n2. **Periodic Audits**: An audit by outside entities are a valuable way for exchanges to understand security vulnerabilities and engender user trust that protocols taken by an exchange are legitimate, secure, and trustworthy. Most exchanges engage with an auditor experienced in an [System and Organizational Control](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/audit-assurance/digital-assurance-transparency/soc-reporting.html) audit and who are comfortable conducting a crypto exchange security audit. \n3. **Sending Notifications** When Funds Are Withdrawn: Most leading exchanges send a user prompts when funds are withdrawn. These messages keep customers informed about when money is moving in their accounts and foster good crypto exchange security.\n4. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Exchanges who practice two-factor authentication force users to input their password and then successfully verify they are the account holder with another tool, like a text message or email code, or even with a special app like Google Authenticator. \n5. Existence of An **Anti-Fraud Department**: Exchanges often hire staffers to build an anti-fraud department to monitor user accounts and transactions to quickly identify issues related to fraud or theft and subsequently secure accounts.\n6. **Insurance**: Some platforms choose to rely on insuring customer funds with insurance, either with an external company or through an internal policy, as part of a crypto exchange security plan.\n7. **Halting Withdrawals After Changing Account Data**: Sometimes, changing account information like a phone number or email means a hacker gained access to an account. To reduce the risk of theft or malaise, some exchanges will temporarily limit withdrawals for a specific period of time after account information is changed to protect customers from losing funds.\n8. **Linking Accounts to an IP** (or a range of IPs): Major exchanges usually monitor IP addresses to track user activity. Some choose to link accounts to specific IP addresses, or a collective of commonly used ones so logins from a strange location can immediately be flagged and investigated as potential fraud.\n\n## Hackers Often Plot Strategically To Steal Funds From Exchanges \n\nCybercriminals have managed to steal funds from a multitude of exchanges despite security efforts put in place. In July 2019, thieves stole [about $32 million](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/12/tokyo-cryptocurrency-exchange-hack-bitpoint-bitcoin) from the Bitpoint exchange in Japan after managing to gain access to the platform\u2019s hot wallet.\n\nIn February 2021, North Korea hackers were accused of stealing nearly $275 million from the KuCoin cryptocurrency exchange in 2020. The exchange [indicated in 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/02/09/north-korean-hackers-accused-of-biggest-cryptocurrency-theft-of-2020-their-heists-are-now-worth-175-billion/?sh=85a94fc5b0bb) around 84% of stolen funds was recovered and KuCoin\u2019s insurance fund covered the rest of the losses.\n\nI hope this information was useful for you and it will help you make the right decision if you are at the stage of choosing a crypto exchange :-)\n\n**Sources i used**:\n\n[https://medium.com/interdax/cryptocurrency-exchange-security-how-interdax-protects-customer-funds-8ef8e8f3eb8a](https://medium.com/interdax/cryptocurrency-exchange-security-how-interdax-protects-customer-funds-8ef8e8f3eb8a)\n\n[https://www.soft-fx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-security/](https://www.soft-fx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-security/)\n\n[https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/answer/Is-Bitcoin-safe-The-truth-about-Bitcoin-security-and-crypto-currency](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/answer/Is-Bitcoin-safe-The-truth-about-Bitcoin-security-and-crypto-currency)\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/12/tokyo-cryptocurrency-exchange-hack-bitpoint-bitcoin](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/12/tokyo-cryptocurrency-exchange-hack-bitpoint-bitcoin)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/02/09/north-korean-hackers-accused-of-biggest-cryptocurrency-theft-of-2020-their-heists-are-now-worth-175-billion/?sh=85a94fc5b0bb](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/02/09/north-korean-hackers-accused-of-biggest-cryptocurrency-theft-of-2020-their-heists-are-now-worth-175-billion/?sh=85a94fc5b0bb)\n\nmedia from shutterstock :-)",

            "text": "r/CryptoCurrency removed my post as I didn't have enough comment karma but thought you would like to see my write up! I  recently found this company on my continued search for low market cap gems.\n\n[https://clintex.io/](https://clintex.io/)\n\nEveryone here is shilling animal coins when they should be looking at cryptos with REAL USE CASES.\n\nThis company is fully public, 5.5M market cap, they passed their audit with Beosin, and have a real use case with huge potential. They are also predicting to begin making revenue in 2022. This isn't a rugpull; they are professional and have partnerships with other companies.\n\nClinTex saw the delays in the pharmaceutical research to bring drugs to market and saw an opportunity - what if they took all the research data and began compiling it on the blockchain? Then pharmaceutical companies could start researching a drug on ClinTex and compare to other studies. This would locate any potential upcoming delays that other companies have encountered and their workarounds.\n\nBayer reports a delay in manufacturing with one company? Go with this other one that isn't reporting delays. Johnson and Johnson showed it took 6 months to get a filing back from the government? You know you start it early. This data will save **millions** to pharmaceutical research costs. It can even help with management of the research, patient data, and vendor payments for any costs to ensure zero slowdowns.\n\nWhen are they expecting business? Here's what they say on their site:\n\n>*We expect to begin on-boarding our partner pharmaceutical clients from Q4\u00a0 2021 on a pilot basis to refine the algorithms in our first app, CTi-EOM. Initial revenue generation is targeted for Q3 2022.*\n\nHow often do you see a cryptocurrency that will generate it's own revenue from offering a SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY? This is what 99% of cryptos **wish** they could do. After ONE good trial with ClinTex, pharmaceuticals will be all over this. And you can be sure you will never see the current price again.\n\nCurious about price? They go on to say: \n\n>*The savings to the pharmaceutical industry represented by the ClinTex Clinical Trials Intelligence proposition far, far exceed the potential CTi token sale fully diluted market cap, and as such we expect to see significant growth, driven by clear and significant demand.*  \n*As per our whitepaper, just a 1% average cost reduction across clinical trials running today would generate a saving of $3.5 billion across the industry (based on today\u2019s averages).*\n\nThese savings aren't something pharmaceuticals will ignore - if the product is shown to work, they will adopt. This bears repeating: ***THIS HAS A 5.5MILLION MARKET CAP*** ***and they are targeting 3.5 billion in savings for companies if they only capture 1%!***\n\nOkay - so this is potentially a great software. But how is this a token? Here is what they've done:\n\n>*The CTi token is used for access to the Clinical Trials Intelligence platform via a staking licence model through the Clinical Trials Intelligence integrated wallet. There is no other payment gateway for access to the platform.*  \n*The CTi token will also be used for inter-platform payments in phase 3, such as reward payments to clinical data providers and third party clinical investigators.*\n\nUs random crypto buyers generally stake our coins for rewards like extra coins - pharmaceuticals in ClinTex will stake for rewards like using the software/payments/data access. And you can be DAMN sure a pharmaceutical company won't care about locking up and holding millions on the platform if it saves hundreds of millions for their team each year. The ultimate HODLer that will eat up liquidity FAST.\n\nThey are listed on KuCoin and state they are working on other exchanges as soon as possible. Don't pass this one by.\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/clintex-cti/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/clintex-cti/)\n\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0x8c18d6a985ef69744b9d57248a45c0861874f244](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8c18d6a985ef69744b9d57248a45c0861874f244)",

They are not connected to the internet making them safer than other options. Trezor is the best bet right now. \n\n**#2  Never Store your Bitcoin on Exchanges:** Exchanges have been the prime target for most hackers. Once the desired trade is made, withdraw your bitcoin and any other crypto and keep it in your personal wallet. \n\n**#3 Store your Private Keys/Wallet Seed Offline and Never Share Them:** \n\nAlways remember;\n\n>*Not your Keys, Not your Bitcoin*\n\n Make sure that your private keys and wallet seed are securely stored **offline.** This is the most secure way to protect your wallet from hackers.\n\n**#5 Keep Backup:**  If by any chance you lose access to your wallet and your private keys, this backup is the only way you can recover your bitcoin. \n\n **#6 Use separate wallets for daily use and savings:**  Always separate your bitcoin into different wallets based on their purpose. Even if one of your wallets gets compromised at least the rest of your bitcoin will be safe. \n\n **#7 Never click or access unverified bitcoin links:**  This goes without saying but, avoid clicking any unverified links claiming to be investment opportunities, bitcoin giveaways, or anything similar asking for your private keys or asking you to send bitcoin. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Source:* [*How to keep BTC Secure*](https://blog.blockonomics.co/bitcoin-security-how-to-keep-your-btc-secure-9826a002043d)",

And for some background, I've been in crypto since 2017, but I'm much more disciplined now than I was back then. \n\nSo first I bought some Dai on coinbase pro, fee wasnt too bad. \n\nThen I transferred it to my MetaMask wallet. Another fee, also not horrible. \n\nThen I go to Uniswap to swap Dai for Flashstake. Found out here that I have to \"Approve\" my Dai, which was another fee.  Whats that about?\n\nThen I finally get to the point where I'm going to get my FLASH, and this final fee is $55!  I know Ive been reading about the crazy high fees, but what they dont tell you is you have to pay several fees before you even get to the big one! \n\nThen I plan to stake my flash, which Im sure will be ANOTHER fee.  \n\nSo here are my questions after this attempt to finally set up some DeFi staking. \n\n1. *How do you all monitor gas fees*, (in order to strike when theyre low).  Just keep ethgasstation open and keep refreshing?  Is there a good time of day that you notice it to be lower?\n2. Another interesting thing I noticed and I'm very curious about,  I was going to swap my Dai to Flash on the Flashstake app but when I set up the trx *on Flash it said for 1350 DAI I would get 1369 Flash.  But on Uniswap, for 1350 DAI I was going to get 2030 Flash.*   *Can anyone tell me why* this is such a big difference?  Am I missing something? \n3. *Anyone have any insight for better strategy to stake some DeFi without losing it all on gas?* I have DAI, ETH, COMP, among others,  and I plan on Hodling so I'd love to make some interest\n4. Ok, last question. *Is staking DeFi going to be a short lived FAD*?   Since the more people that Stake, the more the interest rewards go down, and if you look at CompoundApp , most of the APY are pretty much in line with traditional banks savings accounts.  So what seemed like a very exciting opportunity, now seems like it was short lived and already too late.",

Symbols reduce costs and complexity in  existing processes,  and provide a platform for new business models and  innovation, bringing  together developers, projects and companies to  create mutual benefit  and shared value.\n\nUnlike  its  predecessor NEM, Symbol is a blockchain technology built with a  concept  of a blockchain technology business platform that is friendly to   developers. So that all these conveniences will reduce costs,   complexity, and time-to-market.\n\nIn   addition, the symbol also offers a flexible and secure solution that   can be adjusted through simple features, with powerful built-in   features.\n\nOne  more Symbol also  provides options for access to the public and private  blockchain,  individually or together (Hybrid), so that it can provide  options that  best suit your company\u2019s needs.\n\nCan   you imagine right? What business can be built with all the  conveniences  of this Symbol? Yes all businesses can be integrated with  blockchain  through Symbol starting from Fintech, Gaming, Healthcare,  Supply Chain,  Real Estate, Education, Insurance, Government.\n\nIf   you really are a NEM fan like me, and save some $ XEM in a NEM wallet,   you will get $ XYM in the ratio of 1: 1 to the amount of $ XEM you  have.\n\nI  suggest you participate  in taking the NEM project on your radar again,  which now looks a lot  like a sleeping giant, unless of course you want  to miss another strong  trend in crypto. The rise of the giant blockchain  starts here, so what  are you waiting for?\n\n[Source](https://medium.com/@slamet.gunawan35/symbol-new-project-from-nem-the-rise-of-the-blockchain-giant-d330dc1817fd)",

Before you decide to do anything, you need to understand how much risk you are comfortable with. This is known as your risk tolerance.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bIf you decide to begin exponentially growing your business, you will need risk tolerant capital. It could be $400\u2013800 for smaller capital accounts and $1000\u20132000 larger capital accounts.\n\u200b\u200bFor exceptional returns, speculators could allocate a risk-tolerant capital investment of $2000\u20134000.\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\u200b\u200bMost Network Effect participants should accumulate 1000 $PART position\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is the \u201cPlatinum\u201d standard for $PART STAKING (dividend like returns). As the Network Effect strengthens over time, the value of your holdings and also your interest rewards by staking will grow exponentially!\n\n\nParticl Privacy Platform has a real use-case. It\u2019s a decentralized, private-by-default, eCommerce application that has huge potential for mass adoption. 99% of all other digital assets (cryptocurrencies) DO NOT have anything similar. Most have only a speculative-currency use-case, which is already fulfilled by BITCOIN.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bMany Bitcoin holders will eventually end up accumulating PARTICL ($PART), due to its unique  global private decentralised eCommerce value proposition. What makes Particl second to Bitcoin is its supply which is also considered SCARCE. At the same time Particl is better than Bitcoin as Particl is Privacy and Anonymity oriented DECOM platform for Private Dapps. It\u2019s a Big Bang in the cooking! \n\n\nCurrently Less than 10,000 people on our planet of 7+ billion, could ever HOLD a 1,000 $PART position, since the current Particl supply is less than 10,000,000 PART.\n\n\n\u200b\u200b\u201cPARTICL is all BITCOIN ever wanted to be. BITCOIN is all PARTICL ever wanted to be.\u201c - Particl is Satoshi Nakamoto dream come true \n\n\n\u200b\u200bHypothetical Trade to Make: Buy Particl (PART)\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bAccumulation Price: any price up to ~$47 per 1PART is considered a \u201cdiscount\u201d price. \n\n\nAccumulate (buy slowly, scaling in), stake it and earn passive income on your position. AND REMEMBER, the $Part amount that you stake compound will grow exponentially too!\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bStop Loss: consider placing SL at 1.2x- 2x profit of your average accumulation price and up.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bBuy It On: Bittrex, Chainex or other exchanges where PARTICL $PART is available. \n\n\nLarger risk-tolerant accounts seeking a position should explore OTC options.\n\n\n\u200b\u200bStore It On: Particl Desktop or other wallets.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bImportant note: do not buy into the sell wall. Instead, setup a buy order on the buy side of the order book and wait until someone sells $PART to you. Buy slowly, sell slowly.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bSupport the decentralized Particl network by staking for passive income - compound. There is no minimum so you can stake whatever amount you have accumulated and are comfortable with. (Utilize the network\u2019s SECURITY, PRIVACY & Anonymity; PROSPERITY to ensure your safety.)\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bTo receive a constant stream of staking rewards, the recommended amount is 1000 $PART. A 1000 PART position would generate an approximate ~4% annual staking reward. That\u2019s a monthly earning of 4 PART. The secret is compounding. \n\u200b\u200b \n\n\u200b\u200bAlso remember, helping to grow the Particl Privacy Platform \u201cnetwork effect\u201d and eCommerce activity will generate additional staking rewards from minimal fees paid out by increasing participants. The Big Bang of world trade without third parties! \n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bWhen will the Particl network\u2019s value begin exponential growth? \n\n\nWith 100X exponential growth, 1 PART could be valued $100 USD. So a position of 1000 PART could generate a passive income of $400 a month. If $PART value experiences an additional 10X growth from there to $1000 per 1 PART, that would equate a passive income of $4000 in STAKING REWARDS EACH MONTH! \n\n\nOf course you could scale out (slowly SELL position) over time taking profits whenever you need, want or EXIT your position completely. It is important to always consider taking some profits along the way, as a risk management strategy. At that point, it\u2019d be up to you to decide what to do with your new-found wealth!\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bIs it worth it to take the risk?\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bDuring the BULL market, when cryptocurrency valuations were rising due only to absolute Greater Fool speculation, $PART value spiked to ~$47 USD, without any real world use. But after years of development, Particl has wisely positioned itself for the cryptocurrency BULL RUN (exponential price increase). \n\n\nParticl has a real, working product , with a quality and utility NEVER SEEN before in the Bitcoin or Cryptocurrency space!\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bHypothetical speculation puts Particl\u2019s exponential market capitalization growth at $10,000,000,000 billion USD and over as it\u2019s Satoshi Nakamoto dream coming true!\n\n\nThe value of 1 PART could spike beyond $1000 USD. That means if you had accumulated a 1000 PART position, your $Part value would experience growth to $1,000,000 USD! Not a bad risk vs return, speculative hypothesis for a $1\u20132 thousand investment.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bIf this seems unbelievable, then consider a return of 2000+% ,once $PART gets back to previous highs of $40-$50 range. If your average position entry price is $2, then that\u2019s an exponential wealth generation of ~23.5X\u200a\u2014\u200a34X. So your 1000 $PART position would grow to ~$40,000 -$50,000 wealth.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bCryptocurrency digital-asset markets move very fast. Today it\u2019s a depressing BEAR market- tomorrow it\u2019s a euphoria-filled BULL market. In green we trust! \n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bParticl\u2019s Fundamental Technological value, should be ~$899 USD NOW!!! As its technological innovation is worthy of a position in cryptocurrency\u2019s TOP 10 market cap, RIGHT NOW, AT THIS VERY MOMENT!\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bLet\u2019s compare PARTICL with LITECOIN, currently ranked in the TOP 8th place with $8.74 billion market capitalization.\n\n\nLitecoin has only one only speculative use case- a currency, which is a little faster than BITCOIN transactions. LOL. \u201cMuch speed\u201d the Bitcoin \u201cSilver\u201d. LOL. A meme to the moon. \n\u200b\u200b\n\u200b\u200b\nLitecoin $8.74 billion USD market-cap is only justified by its NETWORK EFFECT (amount of trader speculators, holders, exchanges). So while you can still experience wealth growth with Litecoin, it\u2019s already in the TOP 8 coinmarketcap position, which drastically limits its upside wealth-building potential. It\u2019s only a boring high risk speculative digital currency with no privacy, anonymity or dapps... \n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bNow we understand what enormous value is hiding within the PARTICL PRIVACY PLATFORM, currently hovering around a $6 million marketcap.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bOnce PARTICL reaches LITECOIN\u2019s marketcap of $8.74 Billion, 1 PART will be valued at the equivalent of $899 USD.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bIn Conclusion \n\u200b\u200b\n\u200b\u200b\nParticl offers a Steve Jobs Apple grade mainstream use case, designed to create utility for the underlying $PART digital asset - Decom (decentralised commerce). \n\n\nThis increasing demand will add to Particl\u2019s network effect. As Particl becomes more popular, the platform is poised to grow into a TOP 10 contender within Crypto Industry. \n\n\nThe only question is, are you going to get involved today in strengthening the Particl Platform and securing YOUR financial future?\n\n\nThere are over 2000 digital assets with different Fundamental and Technical value propositions. \n\n\nParticl digital asset offer the BEST Risk/Reward Ratio and the best potential for exponential growth based on respective fundamentals.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bParticl has one of the best FUNDAMENTAL and TECHNICAL offerings in the digital-asset market. It\u2019s private by default Decentralised Dapp platform with first Private Marketplace dapp for global e-commerce trade without third parties. It works right now! And this creates a property designed to increase cash flow. \n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bCash flow is the money that is moving (flowing) in and out of the Particl Privacy Platform and its decentralized applications from Wealth Producing Activities. It is essentially a platform for global business, built into a permission-less and private format without third parties. This increase security, prosperity and wealth of all participants in the network.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bAll around our beautiful planet, businesses will be more than eager to accumulate $PART and use the Particl Privacy Platform e-commerce capacity for every day private and secure trade. Using Particl to gain a competitive advantage will become a natural, intellectual conclusion. As voluntary, permission-less participation grows within the community-driven network effect, so does direct wealth for businesses, customers, governments and every other participant in the OPEN network.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bUtility, and demand, for the PARTICL NETWORK are multi-dimensional. A GLOBAL NETWORK of businesses will emerge seeking to secure privacy, boost revenues and minimize transaction costs by accepting Particl\u2019s underlying cryptocurrency: $PART.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bValue in any system is explained by network effects. Because of this, exponential growth in Particl is rational.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bScarcity is real. Scarcity is a contributing factor in the value increase of many traditional economic systems. The supply of Particl is fixed by a Proof of Stake protocol that cannot be changed.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bDemand, and utility, are multi-dimensional. Particl is much more than a financial asset like a stock or bond. It has the combined qualities of a share (like a security), a currency (like the US dollar), a payment network (like Paypal), and an eCommerce platform (like eBay, Amazon or Alibaba). BUT unlike any of these characteristics, Particl is also PRIVATE, GLOBAL, SECURE and DECENTRALIZED (no single point of failure). In other words, it is better described as a technological innovation that is disrupting how global commerce is conducted.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bThe digital asset market of cryptocurrencies has experienced several bubbles, but has also established a trend of positive growth over many years. Many more bubbles will form while new BULL markets (buying) and BEAR markets (selling) continue to cycle. Despite the volatility, when compared to more established financial markets, the crypto markets are very undervalued.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bParticl is the most INNOVATIVE digital asset the world has ever seen!\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bNETWORK EFFECT\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bNetwork Effect is a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value of a good or service. The Internet is an example. Initially, there were very few users of the Internet. It was of relatively little value to anyone outside of the military and some research scientists.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bBut, as more users gained access to the Internet, more content, information, and services were built into the system. More user-friendly websites were developed, and more users connected to communicate with each other. By making the Internet increasingly valuable to its users, these developments enhanced Network Effect.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bThe NETWORK EFFECT of Particl as follows:\n\u200b\u200b\n\nBusiness Adoption\u200a\u2014\u200abusinesses will increasingly use Particl Open Marketplace because they can increase their profit margins by staking their $PART capital, avoiding eCommerce platform fees (amazon, eBay, etc.), credit card fees, charge-backs, privacy breach, data collection etc.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bConsumer Adoption\u200a\u2014\u200aconsumers can use Particl Open Marketplace to save money, simply by purchasing certain products on private-by-default Markets. Additionally, consumers can purchase items with $PART that they cannot buy (easily) in any other way. Consider: An American can buy Persian rugs or Cuban cigars despite trade embargoes.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bFinancialization\u200a\u2014\u200aParticl will eat up progressively more of the market share of legacy centralized eCommerce platforms, money transmitter companies, etc.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bSecurity\u200a\u2014\u200amerchant, consumer, and speculator adoption lead to a higher price and thus incentivize more participants to stake (a Passive Income similar to dividends). This in turn makes the Particl network even more robust. The decentralized, immutable transaction ledger also serves as a form of Triple Entry Bookkeeping, wherein Debits plus Credits plus the Network Confirmations of transactions increase trust and security across the system.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bDeveloper Mindshare\u200a\u2014\u200aParticl is a predictable network with simple rules and a publicly-auditable codebase. It is fertile ground for the development of complicated privacy and financial tools. Its decentralized nature allows for innovation without permission. Particl\u2019s store-of-value characteristics will increase- as its utility as a medium of exchange on its Private Marketplaces also increases.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bAdoption as a Currency\u200a\u2014\u200agrowth of Particl\u2019s user base (organizations, businesses, individuals) will accelerate further increases in Particl\u2019s price. Finally, a speculative rush could dramatically boost the value of Particl, almost overnight, by 10x or more.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bAdoption of Passive income\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Particl Platform uses Particl Proof-of-Stake, its own native PoS protocol massively improving upon PoS3. Features added by Particl devs include: cold staking, quantum-resistance, voting and more. Stakers, the Particl equivalent of miners, can earn 4% yearly staking interest (dividend-like) in exchange for securing the network with their $PART cryptocurrency. On top of these staking rewards, stakers earn ALL fees and revenue generated by the platform (marketplace, decentralized applications, transactions, messaging, etc.) which means staking becomes increasingly profitable as more people participate in the Particl economy. Other ways to earn money on the Particl Privacy Platform include setting up a SHOP on the Particl Open Marketplace or using any other Particl Privacy Platform decentralized application on which revenue can be generated.\n\u200b\u200b\n\nEvery Crypto enthusiast a real high risk/return investors and speculators should recognise Particl as opportunity to become a real millionaire by investing only $1000.\n\n\nAll top 20 cryptocurrencies are over billion market cap. Mostly driven by memes and very high risk/ return speculation.\n\n\nPARTICL IS INVENTING ITS OWN UNIQUE CRYPTO INDUSTRY MARKET SEGMENT - DECOM - decentralised commerce",

After the MtGOX crack (where I lost close to 10 BTC) I decided I was going to manage my cryptos at home.\n\nThus, I installed Bitcoin Core, synchronized and moved all my remaining BTCs home. I've been 4 years executing it on a weekly basis. Over 100Gb of DB and longer and longer waiting times made the process more and more painful for my Intel I3 old pc. \n\nThen ETH and LTC and other coins appeared. I got into them via Kraken and decided to do exactly the same: ethereum node and Litecoin Core executed localy and backups of my wallets.dat files. \n\nBut that is just not possible anymore. ETH is extremely slow, my SSD is full and I just cannot have the PC working 24h to synchronize fully.\n\nNow I have everything in Kraken and I fear another MtGOX.\n\nSo my question is: **how can I safely store my cryptos at home without depending on an external agent?**\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nTL;DR: I store my BTC, LTC and ETH runing the core apps in my home PC.

The 40% meme, while it could potentially apply to you, isn\u2019t going to be the norm.  Capital gains can get pretty complicated when you start dealing with high frequency trading, especially with crypto.  So I decided to post what I know about capital gains, what the IRS has said about the tax treatment of crypto so far, and why I think you should care.\n\n*I am a tax professional, I deal with this for a living, but this is NOT tax advice.  Please consult a professional about your specific situation.  This post pertains to 2017 only.  2018 will see these brackets change slightly.*\n\n**Why is this important?**\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of threads where people are actively advising others not to file because there\u2019s no way the IRS could possibly track you down.  Think about it: most of these coins are on a public ledger, that\u2019s how they function.  Is it impossible to imagine that one day, even if not right now, the IRS could link you to one of your wallets?  Coinbase has already fallen, and that\u2019s one foot in the door.  *There\u2019s no statute of limitations on tax evasion* \u2013 10 years from now when the technology needed to track old coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum already exists, they can still take legal action.  Now on to the subject at hand:\n\n**What are capital gains, and how do they apply to cryptocurrencies?**\n\nCapital assets are assets that don\u2019t fall under some other asset class the IRS has defined.  It\u2019s a catch-all.  Whenever you sell or trade a capital asset, you have to recognize the gain or loss on that transaction on your tax return.  How you report, and pay tax, on that gain or loss depends on the time you\u2019ve held that asset:\n\n* 1 year or less \u2013 Short Term Capital Gain/Loss\n\n* 1 year and 1 day or more \u2013 Long Term Capital Gain/Loss\n\nShort term capital transactions are taxed at your marginal rate (see [this link](https://taxfoundation.org/2017-tax-brackets/)).  You can see from that link that only amounts over $418,400 are taxed at 39.6%.  It\u2019s a common misconception that a salary raise would bump you into the next tax bracket and cause you to take home less money.  If your taxable income was $425,000, only $6,600 would be taxed at the highest bracket.  The rest would be taxed at the lower rates.\n\nLong term capital transaction are taxed at a lower rate \u2013 0% - 20% based on your total income.  Considering the market, most transactions are not going to fall under long term.\n\n**What does all this mean for crypto trading?**\n\nThe issue becomes, at what point does a taxable event happen?  Is it when I trade back into fiat currency, or every trade?  The answer is it happens on every trade.  Every time you trade a pair on an exchange (think ETH/BTC) it counts as both a buy of one, and the sale of the other.  In order to calculate your gain properly, you need to look at the USD equivalent of one of the pair, at the time of the trade.  This could be incredibly time consuming (or expensive if you hire a professional), but we\u2019ll come back to that in a minute.\n\n**But what about like-kind exchanges?**\n\nUnfortunately, the IRS has yet to give a definitive answer on this.  The most recent guidance given was Notice 2014-21 released in 2014 (read it [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf)).  Because the IRS hasn\u2019t given a definite answer, it leaves open the possibility of a notice or audit.  The paperwork to file even a single like-kind exchange is intense, and there\u2019s a high possibility they\u2019ll disallow it anyways.  It\u2019s not recommended to go this route.\n\n**So how do I track all these trade?**\n\nI\u2019ve been testing out [CoinTracking\u2019s](https://cointracking.info/) taxable gain reporting feature, and it seems to work well.  It plays by all the IRS\u2019s rules by calculating long and short term gains, using FIFO, and tracking the USD equivalent at the time of the trade.  It also has an import option for most exchanges out there, and that also seems to work well.\n\n**So is it fool-proof?**\n\nAbsolutely not.  In fact, it took me hours of testing just to make sure I got my trades to import correctly.  Moving between exchanges and personal wallets can really confuse the tool, and when you\u2019re dealing with hundreds of trades it can be hard to catch.  Please understand that when reporting your gains, it is YOUR responsibility to do it right.  The system might mess up, but it\u2019s still on you.\n\nI\u2019d also like to add that if you trade on EtherDelta, it might be a little more time consuming to enter these, as you\u2019ll need to do it manually.\n\n**What do I do once I calculate my gain?**\n\nAt the point you\u2019ll need to file your return.  Some of you might have filed your own taxes before, and that\u2019s an excellent option if your return is straight-forward and simple.  Unfortunately a return with these types of transactions will not be.  I highly recommend consulting a CPA, particularly one familiar with cryptocurrencies.\n\n**Aren\u2019t CPAs expensive?**\n\nThey can be, but it\u2019s important to understand why.  CPAs almost always bill an hourly rate.  The more complex the return, the more hours they spend on it, and the higher the bill at the end.  The issue is, many, if not most, CPAs will not have dealt with cryptocurrencies before.  Not only will they have to research it, they\u2019ll also most likely want to manually recap your trades.  The end result can be a very expensive bill.\n\n**How do I avoid overpaying for a CPA?**\n\nThe short answer: find a CPA that understands cryptocurrencies.  As time goes on, more and more CPAs will become familiar with cryptocurrencies, but right now there aren\u2019t many.  It\u2019s only been in the past month or so that the AICPA has started sending newletters that mention cryptocurrency.\n\n**Are you accepting clients?**\n\nIt is possible that I could accept you as a client.  If you\u2019re able to provide a complete an accurate list of your trades, and want to file your taxes in the most accurate way possible, I\u2019d be happy to consider working with you.\n\n**How much do you charge?**\n\nLike most CPAs, I bill an hourly rate.  It is probable that your return will cost $500-$800 depending on the complexity, but it could be more if you have a crazy amount of trades or other complex information.\n\n**How do I contact you?**\n\nI\u2019ve created a [quick form](https://goo.gl/forms/R6zcc0DkEpxFC64f1) to give some basic information.  Please do not submit any personal information.  If we\u2019re a good fit to work together, I\u2019ll get back to you at the email address you provide with a way to verify who I am and what my credentials are.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.  I\u2019ll try to answer as many as I can.",

They are merely the developers and spokespeople for a much larger movement. I urge everyone to go onto the Libra Association website, where you'll find that huge-name companies like Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, Uber, Lyft, ebay and booking holdings have signed on. So have Andreessen Horowitz, which has investments in more than 700 companies, and Union Square Ventures, which has around 270 investments. With so many influential companies that have so broad an impact on society, Libra really is poised to disrupt the world's financial system in a major way and is probably cryptocurrency's best chance of becoming mainstream (even though I do have reservations about the way it is structured). Using just their existing partners, one could use Libra to book their hotel and airline tickets, pay for a Lyft from the airport to their hotel, pay for dinner using Mastercard or Visa, etc. Once the currency gets approval from governments, I suspect that even more companies will sign on, making it all the more convenient for the general public.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese companies are too large, and frankly too reputable, to circumvent the law if Libra is banned in any country. I suspect that it will be banned in Venezuela and a handful of other places. However, these companies have tremendous power over the world economy, which can manifest itself in a good deal of political power as well. I suggest that governments start fostering a good relationship with the association now to ensure a stronger economy when this thing takes off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also think that it's going to become increasingly essential for the crypto wallets and exchanges of the future to support this new currency. I have major concerns about Coinbase and Anchorage (both of which have signed onto the Libra Association currently) and Facebook's proposed wallet Calibra. I'm never a fan of custodial wallets (due to concerns about hacking, surprise fees, asset freezing, etc) and given how Facebook has botched data privacy over the past few years, I would never willingly open a Calibra wallet. The only fully noncustodial wallet that has announced plans to include Libra (that I know of) is TrustlessBank, but I suspect that more will follow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo I think that Libra will completely take over the financial system? Probably not. But it will give new legitimacy to cryptocurrency as a whole, and I think it will have a positive effect on Bitcoin in particular. If I have Libra but I need to send money to someone who is suspicious of it because of its connection to Facebook (I certainly wouldn't blame them), I could use a wallet supporting atomic swaps (at present, I know of Atomic Wallet, Cointorox's Atomic Swap Wallet, and TrustlessBank) to convert my Libra to Bitcoin and send it to them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, where do you guys see Libra in ten years? Disagree with anything I said? Have anything to add?",

First of all, I\u2019ll be getting that sweet post karma on Reddit, and, secondly, I\u2019ll increase the awareness for an exchange that I am planning to use and that I hold tokens of.\n\nI won\u2019t go really deep into technical aspects, because I am not a proficient developer, but I\u2019ll go over the main technical features of the exchange, since they really show why NEXT has a significant edge over competitors. These features are also the reason why I believe that NEXT will capture a sizeable market share from other crypto exchanges. So, let\u2019s start:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Decentralized nature of crypto-crypto trading + fiat ramp.\n\nEveryone knows about IDEX, right? I used it back in the days and it\u2019s been a great experience for me in search of moonshots until they introduced KYC, but that\u2019s a whole other story. My point is that, even with their interface thats looking a bit dated, I felt very safe trading, since I used my Ledger as my exchange wallet, and I never had to worry about any hacks, because hey, decentralization right. That\u2019s what I really appreciate about NEXT - they claim to combine centralized infrastructure with decentralized features, thus having both easy trading interface and provide their users with access to wallet private keys. Sounds pretty nice to me.\n\nThey also state that they will provide fiat onramp through their banking partners Bunq and Klarna, which is undoubtedly great and will save plenty of time, since I won\u2019t have to go back and forth between Coinbase or someone else and NEXT to get my ETH/BTC to buy some altcoins, which is another win in my book.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Fair and sensible listing policy.\n\nNEXT is alleviating some burden off our shoulders, as the exchange itself will be doing due diligence and list only active and growing projects with teams that are willing to do KYC. Also, judging from their last [AMA](https://medium.com/nextexchange/july-ama-ceo-coo-d65cdefc3adf), the team really understand current market conditions and trends, so I expect them to list young projects that really need listings for exposure and that might be future 100x lowcap gems.\n\nAlso, team is pretty liberal with their listing policy (considering that the project is legit) and has shown a willingness to list a project if a sufficient percentage of community members will want it to be list on NEXT.exchange. Basically projects with active and growing communities will be given preference. I think that overall, this is a good practice, which really shows that the team is willing to listen to its people and be very democratic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Transparent & efficient fee distribution.\n\nThe cherry on top of the hybrid cake is the fee distribution. The model that NEXT will follow is that the trading fees accumulated by the exchange are distributed amongst NEXT holder (with the exception of necessary operating costs). The NEXT team have also developed their own blockchain, [NEXT.chain](https://medium.com/nextexchange/next-chain-insights-a8fe0b243e65), which supports Masternodes. The NEXT Masternodes are a pretty significant investment (several k USD iirc), but a lot of slots are already filled, around 85% or so allocated for the first year, according to their CEO. Because NEXT is based on its own custom blockchain, every successful order is a mineable transaction. Nodes mine that and get rewarded for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou should check out this [**calculator**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gSAmzInv7-4sPlJkbQCa6EOepfUlhr9jzTTqH7ACJ2s/edit?usp=sharing) to fiddle around with fee redistribution numbers and rewards. I hope you\u2019ll be as impressed as I was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ll finish this one on a sentimental note - human beings are prone to overlook exceptional possibilities. Many of us heard about Bitcoin when the price was in tens or even in hundreds, but most just remained indifferent.\n\nMissing Bitcoin at 150$, missing AMZN at 400$, missing taking my high school crush to prom (okay I made this up for comedic effect) taught me to treat the opportunities that come up around me differently.\n\nI am not saying that NEXT is necessarily the one, but it\u2019s at least worthy of a proper, careful examination.",

            "subreddit": "CryptoCurrencies",
            "text": "So, what is Algorand and why should you pay attention to it? Let's break it down. \n\nAlgorand is a public crypto blockchain and protocol that aims to solve the \"crypto trilemma\". That means Algorand fixes the problems other blockchains have with security, scalability, and decentralization. Pretty much every other blockchain fails in one of those three categories. Algorand doesn't. \n\nIt operates on a Pure Proof of Stake system, so gone are the days of high electricity usage. Algorand's staking system is so simple all you need is 1 Algo (the Algorand token) in the Algorand wallet (which is available for free on both Android and iPhone and is fantastic) to start staking. That's it. You'll earn Algos proportional to how many you hold in your wallet ***every 20 minutes***. Yeah, you heard that right. Every 20 minutes your Algorand wallet rewards you with new Algos that are immediately compounded. It's the best thing since sliced bread. You'll be earning nearly **6%** per year just by holding your Algos on your phone, it literally couldn't be easier. \n\nWhat else is awesome about Algorand? Flippin everything man. Algorand has a transaction speed of 1000 transactions per second. That means you'll have your transaction *finalized* in under 5 seconds. So say good bye to the days of waiting for 30+ confirmations before your transaction goes through and several hours before you know if it's truly been finalized. This blows Ethereum straight out of the water. \n\nFurthermore, Algorand transactions only cost .001 Algo, that's like 0.0012 of a cent. Really. I tried to use Uniswap the other day, you know how much Eth it charged me to make a single transaction? **$9 worth**. Seriously. And then the transaction **didn't go through**. I mean, come on. Ethereum's transaction fees are skyrocketing, vs Algo's which will always remain the same because they've solved scalability issues blockchains like Ethereum haven't. \n\nAlgorand has been designed by a team of geniuses, check out their team's profiles on the Algorand website, they're practically all big shot computer scientists from MIT and Berkeley with tons of awards backing up their credibility. This isn't some slapped together team of Romanian engineers fresh out of college, these guys are serious big fish with established careers, you literally can't find a more distinguished team behind a crypto today. If anything, you should invest in the team behind Algorand, they're absolute powerhouses.\n\nAlgorand has a venture capital firm working to promote its spread and adoption. That's big money spending money to make more money. Which means you don't have to, all you have to do is hop on board the gravy train to flavor town. Speaking of hopping on board, Algorand is now on Coinbase as of July of this year and you know getting on Coinbase means your coin is at the entrance to the cryptocurrency world for most new US traders, that fact alone gives a huge boost to Algorand going up. \n\nAlgorand launched on June 19th, 2019. Since then it's jumped to the 37th highest market cap in the crypto world. Seriously, in just a year and two months Algorand has gained a market cap of **$430 million**. If that doesn't tell you the train is chugging full steam ahead I don't know what will. \n\nAlgo is still cheap. Right now it's at 55 cents per Algo, that's chump change compared to what it'll be worth in a year or two, and the gains are just going to keep coming as Algorand just released (6 days ago) new features that help a ton with DeFi apps. These new features include stateful smart contracts that increase efficiency by storing certain information in user accounts rather than in the code. And Algorand now allows private rekeying, meaning you can now change the custody of wallets easily, a feature no one else has and one that will have massive positive implications for DeFi. Algorand is set up to become the leading blockchain in the DeFi space by providing huge improvements for developers over Ethereum. \n\nGet ready for salty bears to claim Algorand has already failed because their ICO price was $2.88 and then it dropped, that just means it's time to buy in ya dinguses. \n\nTldr: There's so many benefits to Algorand it's ridiculous. It's the strongest competitor for Ethereum in the Crypto space today and will ultimately eat a huge chunk of Eth's market share based on pure advantages over Eth, so get on board now before you miss out. \n\nAnd be sure to use the Algorand wallet and get those sweet, sweet staking rewards. Let your money make you money.",

I have been studying and getting really unto just for about a month, and I have been actively trying to learn more and more. I am working my ass off trying to understand as much as I can, but there is one thing I can't really figure out.\n\nCorrect if I am wrong, but from what I gathered it seems that the crash in 2017/2018 was unexpected. Then I was reading more about cycles, how about everything is cyclical and therefore is going to happen again, and people are trying to \"predict\" or at least guess when is going to happen again. Because it is sure that is going to happen. But why?\n\nI understand the concept of it, the halving, the cycle... but if everyone involved knows about it, doesn't that decrease the chance of happening? So many people are yelling HODL (not just here), therefore, logically, if a crash happens again, less investors are going to be scared and sell because they know more than before, therefore lessening (is that even a word?) the crash, therefore.... and so on and so on. Am I missing something extremely important or I am just to noob, or simply too naive in thinking that people won't panic? Or at this point is like a self-fulfilling prophecy kind of thing?\n\nI am afraid I missed already this bull, I practically have no wallet because as a student I have no extra money to invest, and I am kinda sad about it, so it won't really affect me either way. The only thing I have a is 1 nano, few empty wallets that I set up to get some free stuff (Binance, Coinbase, etc) but that's it. So I am more curious than anything, cause I feel like I am missing something.\n\nThanks to everyone, and sorry for my English, it ain't my first language",

[Who am I kidding?]\n\n1- **Are the COINS or Tokens we exchange somewhat analogue to stocks?**\nAltough this could sound incredibly stupid, when someone hears \"Bitcoin\" the COIN part sticks out: A store of value in a unit of whatever.\nHowever a lot of altcoins seem to work different. They seem to be ''projects'' of whatever subject, or new technologies that solve X issue. Lets take Lisk for example, \"Lisk is a Blockchain application platform, established in early 2016. Based on its own Blockchain network and token LSK, Lisk will enable developers to create, distribute and manage decentralized Blockchain applications\"\nHere's when I get lost: What is a Lisk token then? What is it for? Is it just me or it seems quite resemblant to stocks?\n\n\n2- **Where and how do the big exchanges get the coins they sell from?**\nLets say we bought 10 BTC from Bittrex/Bitfinex/whateverexchange, we pay for the BTC and we get them in said platform. To whom do those exchanges pay in order to get the BTCs they sell, afterwards, to us?\n\n\n3- **How do desktop wallets/paper wallets work or where can I read \"\"in-depth\"\" ?** [Not a technicall description]\n\n\n4- **Is there any good article/video describing the differences between the FOMO Investing we are currently experiencing in the Cryptocurrency market and that of the DOT COM Bubble? Are there any differences?**\nOr are the differences intrinsic to the markets involved, or to the economic context in each case? -you get the point, I wanna be informed in that matter-\n\n\n 5- **Can you recommend good books/videos on \"Trading\" and how to get started?**\n\n\n6- **Does ''Jaxx'' lack any kind of security?** [Except for that ridiculous 4 digit PIN]\n\n\n7- **Which is the best place to get information on the news regarding Crypto market?** Whether there is a fork incoming, some market phenomenon going to take place, a major company/investor signing X or Y involving Crypto market, etc.\n\n\n8- **If, like many claim, AT is pseudoscience do huge investors - Buffet for instance - use only Fundamental Analysis?** Or is there some truth behind Day Trading w/ Fibonacci, Elliot, etc?\n   Any recommended article that explains this subject?",

Support is not great. Crypto Pro (for Mac) is good too but it doesn't load trade information from exchanges, only balances - hence I cannot see Gains and Losses.\n\nAny other suggestions out there?

So, what is Cryptocurrency and where did it emerge from?\n-Satoshi Nakamoto, the unknown inventor of Bitcoin started the trend as a side product for another invention, though it was never actually intended to become a currency, its announcement in 2008 was heralded as a step towards \u201cA Peer-to-Peer Electronic cash system\u201d succeeding where many others had failed to do so. \n     \n But to strip it back further than that; Cryptocurrencies are by definition \u2018limited entries into database no one can change without fulfilling specific conditions and how is that so different from the typical electronic banking of today? Money is about a verified entry into a database of some sort which can only be changed or edited depending on the met criteria or variables- the difference is that instead of having physical cash or assets, the Cryptocurrency lives online! With cryptography, the entries into the databased are secured with math rather than people and avoid the \u2018double spending\u2019 issue (sending one asset to multiple people) by forming restricted network entries.\n     \n Entries themselves are what represents Cryptocurrency and this is where nodes and miners come in. Cryptocurrencies are formed by the network to incentivise peers (nodes/miners) who in turn work to secure the network and check entries, each network is individual and has a unique way of generating and distributing itself to peers. Miners solve the next \u2018block\u2019 of entries-The \u2018solving\u2019 is finding a hash that connects the new block with the old one and continues the construction of the network a.k.a  a \u2018Blockchain\u2019. The block represents the entries and the chain represents the hash. Hashes by comparison are a type of crypto-logical puzzle like a Sudoku puzzle in which peers or \u2018miners\u2019 can connect the blocks.\n\nMost Cryptocurrencies follow the same rules and so the following applies to most;\n\n-They\u2019re irreversible,\n- Anonymous,\n-Fast and globally accessible, \n-Built to be very secure\n-They have a controlled supply limited to their network\n \n        \nSo why after all this should you be looking at Electroneum? Electroneum is a currency developed to enable anyone; no matter their technical skill-set; to access Cryptocurrency easily! Install the Electroneum app and within minutes you\u2019ll see Electroneum currency added to your paper wallet via the unique mobile miner, without having to start out with specialist equipment. Unlike other well-known companies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum; Electroneum works entirely from a free app! Electroneum\u2019s unique features make it far more accessible for the average person, not only does it provide the same level of security and access you would expect from Bitcoin e.t.c; it also gives instant access to Electroneum with no card details or ID!\n        \nThe future market of cryptocurrencies is vast and full of potential, every day new currencies emerge, perhaps even one day Cryptocurrency may gain in its legitimacy as protocol for business transactions, micro payments and much more. Many consider Cryptocurrency the way out of escaping capital control-Is Cryptocurrency the hedge we need against fiat turmoil and inflation? Perhaps. But we can be sure of one thing, Cryptocurrency is here to make its mark as a revolutionary against monetary policy and we\u2019re excited to see where it leads.\n\nFor more information on Electroneum and how you can get involved, head over to the website; http://electroneum.com/",

I wondered why I could see my investments when I used the companies tools but never could see the tokens in my Ether wallet by Freewallet. As it turns out, when you send your coins from ANY Freewallet, the source account that actually sends the coins is an account that belongs to and is controlled by Freewallet. There are MILLIONS of dollars in tokens locked in accounts that users will never see or get back.\n\nIF you send investment money from any Freewallet, ALL of the future proceeds from that investment will go to and belong to Freewallet.\n\nHere is how you can see your Ether tokens. Go to the wallet you originally sent your investment from. In history, find the investment. Navigate to the blockchain viewer. Find the address your coins were sent from. Copy this address. Then go to myetherwallet.com. Under \"View Wallet Info\" check mark \"View with address only\". Paste the address your coins came from in the box. Once a valid address is entered, you will see a box labeled \"Unlock\". Click this box to see your true worth.\n\nGood luck trying to get any of those tokens back from Freewallet. Thus far the support team has sent me three emails telling me how I can PURCHASE tokens using there new wallet and they have completely IGNORED my repeated request for help in getting my tokens out of their control.\n\nHere is where they have you. You can prove you made the original investment if the address you sent your coins to sends coins back to that same address. Then it is up to Freewallet to acknowledge that direct connection. They may or may not. But what if you sent money to an investment company as I did. One that automatically invest in ICO's and other cryptocompanies for you and deposits your proportional shares of the resulting tokens into the account that sent the coins to the investment company originally. In that case you will NEVER be able to make a direct connection between you and the tokens. Therefore, Freewallet gets to keep and control any such coins both past and future deposits. Since, most of these arrangements are completed by smartcontracts, there is NO WAY to change the sending address after the fact.\n\nMajor lesson here: NEVER USE FREEWALLET PRODUCTS TO INVEST. In fact, I would recommend that no one ever use Freewallet for anything. If you can not prove you sent money from YOUR OWN address, how many other things in the future will you NOT be able to prove using the blockchain ledger.\n\nWhen I started, I like many of you, knew very little. I got Freewallet from Google and saw many different Freewallets for different coins. I have several of them. I have now lost HUNDREDS of Thousands of dollars in cryptos because I always thought I had the keys to my Freewallet. Another major lesson: Free almost NEVER IS.\n",

Again, staked fairly recently, yet to claim any rewards.\n\nI have setup my Trezor, transferred little ETH to test. I have already tested wiping it off and recovering with my seed. I feel confident enough now to be able to transfer most of my holdings to it.\n\nNow my questions are:\n\n1. How should I go about transferring, to incur as little transfer fee as possible? Should I transfer each coin directly from their respective source (Exodus and Coinbase), or should I transfer them to Coinbase first (and move to Trezor wallet from there) .\n2. For staked coins (ADA, ATOM & XTZ), can I stake them even after moving to Trezor?\n3. Last, and a bit unrelated question. How does one keeps monitoring the portfolio if then holdings are in a hardware wallet? I understand I need to connect my Trezor everytime I need to see my portfolio?\n\nThank you in advance.",

            "text": "KUCOIN EXCHANGE / KCS - 90% REVENUE REDISTRIBUITED TO HOLDERS!! A COMPREHNSIVE ANALISYS OF KUCOIN EXCHANGE AND KUCOIN SHARES\n\n**If you'll find this helpful, please sign up using my invitation link:** [https://www.kucoin.com/#/signup?r=E3iEp_!](https://www.kucoin.com/#/signup?r=E3iEp_)\n\nQuick disclosure, nothing in this article should be considered as financial advice, this is purely my opinion and my research alone, take it with a grain of salt.\n\nIt\u2019s an up-and-coming cryptoexchange that is like an integration of COSS and Binance. The problem with COSS is that there is little incentive for investors to use it, the UI is lackluster, it lacks proper charting tools, the previous CEO was known to be part of pyramid schemes. Binance, a similar Hongkong exchange is something that we can also compare KCS to, the BNB token offers the utility to reduce fees, but again there\u2019s little incentive to actually have BNB tokens are use the Binanance exchange. I elaborate further on the advantages the Kucoin will have over other exchanges.\n\nKucoin has similarities to COSS in that 50% of fees that they charge are returned to the holders of KCS everyday at 12am. Holders of KCS get access to other perks such as trading fee discounts similar to BNB, customer-service fast passes and more. I also need to highlight that the 100m that is being with-held for 4 years and 30m of which is locked up for 2 years belonging to the founders/investors respectively ARE NOT subject to the 50% re-compensation of fees which normal traders/investors earn. Which means that only the current 100m supply for the next 4 years is eligible to receive the *dividends* from KCS.\n\nKucoin has a long-term goal of becoming a decentralized exchange(DEX) or integrating as much of it as they possibly can within their ecosystem, a point that I\u2019d really like to highlight is that recently there has been a lot of news/FUD around exchanges like Bittrex and Bitfinex banning users, Finex have already disabled US citizens access to trading on their platform, and Bittrex is a US exchange, so who knows when they\u2019ll have to close their doors to US citizens, they\u2019ve even gone so far as to ban people from middle-eastern nations, however decentralized exchanges are on-chain and there is no governance or need to store funds on centralized exchanges to risk being hacked, as well as lawmaking bodies having no jurisdiction over them. There are currently withdrawal limits on accounts but the developers will be removing those very shortly, Kucoin has extremely fast transfer times with lower amounts of confirmations for speedy deposit/withdrawal, low transaction fees of 0.1% with special events where some coins are free to trade, such as WTC/HSR as of now.\n\nThe user interface is amazing compared to most exchanges out there, they enable trading view charting which is much better for traders to use compared to charts such as on Bittrex or Binance which have a very limited selection of charting tools, there are some kinks on the website such as the orderbook, however I have had a talk with the developers and they said that they were looking for \u201cmore elegant ways\u201d to display the orderbook than just a scrollbar, they were also looking into producing a nightmode which is a god-send for night-dwelling (night-traders).\n\nThe Kucoin team are extremely active and have nearly 24/7 support, you can go into their telegram and ask them any question and they\u2019ll answer you hastily and earnestly.\n\nThey also have an invitation bonus which is as a referral compensation program, basically for every person that YOU invite, you get 20% of the trading fees of the person you invited as an INCOME, and then 12% of the trading fees of the people that they invite. (I know you think that this reeks of a pyramid-scheme, however, I need to highlight that the KCS team do NOT benefit at all from this referral program as they actually LOSE money if OTHER people/users are using these referrals.) It is an attempt to bring more volume and traffic, but traders/investors only stand to gain from this, we have absolutely nothing to lose, the more friends you invite the more income you can have. (Some people are calling this a pyramid scheme, however it\u2019s simply a marketing tool, I brush up on this in the second half of the article)\n\nRight now, KCS is flying under the radar, it hasn\u2019t even been added to CMC yet (they are getting it added very soon) and once it does we do expect to see a lot of hype, there will be a very huge in-flux of traders who would come to the exchange, I see this as the death of COSS, no one will go back once they try out KCS.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the valuation of KCS, currently there is 200m supply cap, eventually over a long period of time the KCS team will buyback KCS (optional to sell to them) with the profits made from trading fees to the burn the supply until there is only 100m left, don\u2019t be alarmed by this, there won\u2019t be a sudden supply restriction of 100m over one night, its something that will probably take a decade to achieve, if not even longer. Who knows for sure, right so moving on; KCS is currently valued at approximately $0.6USD at 200m supply thats around $54m USD market cap. It\u2019s only been out for under a month and the ICO price was $0.3USD(5000 satoshis) or around there, so it has doubled and a medium-high marketcap of $54m but lets compare the price to Binance, which is currently $1.27 through all of the FUD/FOMO on Bitcoin/bitcoin gold/2x. Token supply of 200m like, similar to KCS, was valued at its peak approximately $2.58 per BNB reaching a total market cap of around $270m, and it doesn\u2019t even have the same features as KCS. So, KCS is currently valued at $0.6USD, with all of its amazing features, team, dividend payout, referral program; I believe has the potential to grow even larger and maintain its price. If not more. I do see this as a huge long-term project, it\u2019s the mainstream exchange killer, it\u2019s like the oneplus versus Apple and Samsung, if we actually evaluate the coin and the Kucoin exchange itself within its ecosystem it has nearly unlimited potential.\n\n**One of the common misconceptions and concerns is that traders have is, is Kucoin a MLM/Pyramid scheme?**\n\nWhat we have here is one of the posters on their website promoting an invitation/referral compensation program. The initial impact of the image makes one think that it is a pyramid scheme, but if you actually look closely you\u2019ll understand that in actual fact Kucoin themselves don\u2019t really benefit at all, they\u2019re giving 90% of all of their fees to the referee as compensation while they only take 10%. This isn\u2019t a pyramid scheme or some shady MLM, it\u2019s a marketing tool to attract more traders and liquidity to the market. The only people who really benefit are the traders.\n\nGetting straight to the point, it has a picture of a pyramid, but it isn\u2019t a pyramid scheme. I need to highlight that the referral system is completely optional, you don\u2019t need to invite anyone or spam your link, I understand that it does get annoying for people. It is a marketing plan aimed at being a liquidity attraction tool to try to hook more traders into using the exchange, but people are so stigmatized to the shape of pyramids that they fail to see the truth behind the curtains.\n\nI\u2019d like to go through the business model and ecosystem of exchanges, and as objectively as I can compare the difference between each exchange.\n\nSo for this example I\u2019ll use 3 exchanges:\n\n    A. Bittrex\n\n    B. Kucoin\n\n    C. GDAX\n\nI\u2019d like to make a fair evaluation of these exchanges based on three things.\n\n    1. Trading fees\n\n    2. User friendliness\n\n    3. Trading tools.\n\nFirst, some more assumptions Kucoin is still in its early stages of launching as an exchange, I\u2019ve talked to the developers and they will be adding in \u201cmore elegant ways to see the orderbook\u201d and stoploss/take profit systems.\n\n5-point evaluation: very good, good, mediocre, bad, very bad.\n\n    A. 1. Mediocre-Bad (0.25%) 2. Good 3. Mediocre-good.\n\n    B. 1. Very good (0.1%) 2. Good 3. Good\n\n    C. 1. Mediocre-Bad (0.25%) 2. Good. 3. Mediocre\n\nSome other underlying assumptions are that each exchange has the same amount of trading volume daily; $100m. Each have the same variety of coins listed.\n\nGiven that information, which exchange would you personally as a trader gravitate towards; try to be as subjective as possible. If my evaluations are wrong, let me know and I will amend them.\n\nYou would inherently choose B. Correct? There is a recurring argument that the token offers no utility, the truth in the fact is that very few tokens offers anything at all, BTC is simply a speculative asset with no intrinsic value, and that\u2019s it. I haven\u2019t introduced the token dynamic just yet, so hold up.\n\nGoing back to the MLM/Pyramid scheme aspect of it. For something to be a pyramid scheme it has to have an initial buy-in where the grunts at the bottom purchase a product, and it has to directly benefit the upper echelons id est the developers/the exchange.\n\nDoes Kucoin meet any of those requirements? Not really. The referral program doesn\u2019t require anything, you don\u2019t need to hold Kucoin to be eligible for the 20% of fees that you\u2019re earning from people you invite. It\u2019s completely optional with no buy in, no product to sell. You can just use the exchange, or even invite people to get the referral bonus, then forget about it, and as they trade on the exchange you earn a % of those transaction fees passively. In fact, the Kucoin team loses from this marketing. Because they\u2019re essentially giving a cut of the fees which they should earn back to its traders. Bittrex/GDAX don\u2019t offer anything at all, they simply take 100% of all fees they have and put it in their pockets.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n    A. Bittrex pockets all transaction fees it earns from traders on its exchange without any compensation to traders.\n\n    B. Kucoin offers an optional referral promotion whereby referees earn a % of fees that are incurred by the referred to the referee as compensation to help bring more liquidity to the exchange. This is actually detrimental to kucoin as they earn less income from transaction fees by giving it to the referees.\n\n    C. GDAX pockets all transaction fees it earns from traders on its exchange without any compensation to its traders.\n\nIf you believe that this statement is incorrect, or overly subjective please speak out.\n\nNow, the issue with the token. Some people are saying that it has no utility; I\u2019m going to prove that it does have utility.\n\n    A. Bittrex does not offer a utility token which reduces fees, or returns any portion of their income to traders. Of $100m trading volume they pocket $250K a day.\n\n    B. Of all Kucoin token holders, 50% of all transaction fees earned by the exchange are transferred nightly at 12AM to Kucoin token holders. Of $100m daily trading volume they pocket $50k, while the other $50k is transferred to its token holders.\n\n    C. GDAX does not offer a utility token which reduces fees, or returns any portion of their income to traders. Of $100m trading volume they pocket up to $250K a day.\n\nIf there\u2019s a problem with my calculations, please let me know.\n\nNow I need to ask, is there value in holding the token? It is a speculative asset, which provides utility in generating returns for the holders of the token on the exchange. As far as tokens/coins go I\u2019m fairly certain that this token has utility, it doesn\u2019t just offer a cut of the 50% of daily trading volume as income but can also act eventually as fee discounts similar to BNB, as well as simply holding it will grant you support-fast access(Give that their support team is already very fast, that\u2019s something to consider).\n\nThere is also no inherent need for the token, Bittrex/GDAX are already largely successful even without utility tokens, so why is Kucoin going out of their way to even lose up to 50% of their income?\n\nThe answer lies in liquidity, and competition; the utility token, the referral compensation system, they are all liquidity attraction tools. Exchanges make money based off how much transaction fees they can incur through the amount of daily trading. How does a new exchange compete with big wigs like Bittrex/GDAX? These are huge giants who have been in the game for a long time, but they\u2019re some-what obsolete. They\u2019re greedy and only care about themselves, have horrible customer-service and poor communication within their community. Kucoin offers more than that, you can go talk to its active development team in their telegram, bombard them with any stupid question you like, and they will respond.\n\nThe token, the referral system are liquidity attraction tools, even if they only get 50% of all trading fees as income, if they can attract more liquidity than other exchanges and become competitive they can also be big, furthermore we as investors holding the token don\u2019t lose anything at all, in fact we get a cut of the 50% of the trading fees they earn. I\u2019ve already received my first dividend last night at 12am, it was basically nothing but that is considering that they only have a trading volume of $1.1m a day approximately, if not less. If that was $300m, the number of dividends anyone would get would be 3-fold.\n\nWhat to take away from this; it seems like an MLM/Pyramid scheme on the surface, but the developers do not directly benefit from giving traders a huge cut of their profits, their main goal is liquidity and competition. The token value is also a long-term goal, I should reiterate that there is currently only a total supply of 200m which will over a course of a very long time will be reduced to 100m, but that will be a very long time from now, 100m of the current supply is locked up for 4 years for the team/2 for advisors. As well as, being locked up they aren\u2019t eligible to receive any of the 50% cut of the trading fees until AFTER they are released.\n\nI see this as potential big opportunity, purely because in the future I can see the possibility of this becoming a very competitive exchange within crypto-space. This is without a doubt a shill, I\u2019m not partnered with them or anything, but I felt like I needed to clarify what a pyramid scheme is and the distinction between Kucoin\u2019s marketing model and an actual MLM like Amway.\n\n**The dividend model (50% of trading fees are given to the KCS holders)**\n\nI\u2019d like to also go through the dividend model, every night at UTC+8 12AM, they deposit directly into your wallet address your share of the 50% trading fees that they earned from transactions during the day. The current daily trading volume is around $1.1m, if Kucoin can achieve competitiveness and run up next to some of the biggest names; Bittrex with $350m daily trading volume, you can expect that all of the dividends you earn will go up 350x as well. I\u2019d like to also point out that the more popular the coin is the more transactions there are thus; you are always earning income in the most popular coin, no matter what it may be.\n\n**More on the utility of Kucoin (White paper abstract)**\n\n*To improve user involvement and exchange vitality, Kucoin is going to award incentive bonus, which equals to 50% of the total trading fees charged by the platform, to users who hold KCS in their accounts. Please note that this award proportion could be adjusted based on the actual situation in the future. The initial amount of KCS is 200 million among which 100 million owned by the team and angel investors would not be taken into account when calculating the bonus. In addition, we guarantee that at most 100 million KCS be calculated in the bonus plan during official buy-back and destruction. To obtain the daily bonus, users would need to deposit their KCS into Kucoin Platform. Then the platform will conduct accounting and award bonus based on to the KCS holdings in user\u2019s account at 0:00 (UTC+8) that day and all the trading fees charged to the platform on the previous day.Then the bonus gained by users will directly put to their Kucoin accounts in the corresponding currency. For instance, If ETH-BTC cryptocurrency pair rate is 0.063 on the platform and the daily exchange volume is 30,000 BTC; based on the 0.1% rate from each side, the platform shall charge 30 BTC and 476 ETH as trading fees. The bonus for every 10,000 holdings would be 10,000 by 100,000,000 (0.01%). So that the daily bonus from this very cryptocurrency pair is 0.003 BTC and 0.0476 ETH (1 BTC and 17 ETH annually). Please note that this is ONLY the ETH-BTC exchange pair BONUS. Other than ETH-BTC, there are still various cryptocurrency pairs on the platform, which creates the trading fees in the corresponding currency and bonus based on the description above.\n\nTRADING FEE DISCOUNT When placing orders to trade, holding a certain amount of KCS in Kucoin account can lower the trading fee. Details will be published through announcements.\n\nOTHER EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS When KCS holding reaches certain levels, users can enjoy special services like one-on-one investment consultation, customer service Fast-Pass, etc.*\n\n**Full transcript of my Q&A with the Operation Director Kent Li**\n\nTwo concerns were put fourth by some of my readers:\n\n    How do we know that we are actually receiving the 50% that you are guaranteeing us?\n    In the whitepaper it is stated that the 50% of trading fees traders on the platform will earn is subject to change, what is the reasoning behind this?\n\n    Kent Li\u200a\u2014\u200aKucoin\u200a\u2014\u200aOperation Director, [22.10.17 00:35]\n    Firstly, the users are actually getting 50%. The trading volume of each pair is transparent, people can get the data from the web page or through our public API endpoints. So there\u2019s nowhere to hide if we cheated on this, people can easily calculate their Kucoin Bonus based on the formula we described in the whitepaper.\n\n    Kent Li\u200a\u2014\u200aKucoin\u200a\u2014\u200aOperation Director, [22.10.17 00:39]\n    Secondly, many people have discussed our referral system. The reason why we design is like what you have said, to attract more people to come trade on Kucoin. Because we\u2019re new comers in this industry even in China, we have to do everything to attract new users and become competitive in the space, that\u2019s why we share 90% of our trading fees to the users. We want to survive. And we are working our asses off to achieve this.\n\n    USER, [22.10.17 01:15]\n    Thanks for that clarification! I\u2019d also like to inquire about the rate of dividends that investors earn, currently it is at 50% and in the whitepaper has been stated that it will be subject to change, how long is the 50% bonus going to last? Some of my readers had told me that it will only be for around 6 months, you intend on reducing the income as your exchange becomes more popular correct?\n\n    USER, [22.10.17 01:16]\n    Also, what is the purpose of the income page in the \u201cAssets\u201d menu, currently all fields are blank, what are your plans for that?\n\n    Kent Li\u200a\u2014\u200aKucoin\u200a\u2014\u200aOperation Director, [22.10.17 01:18]\n    Hi, we do have a plan to reduce the ratio of Kucoin Bonus. It will stay at 50% for at least 6 months, and it will be adjusted gradually, eventually it will be 15% after two or three years. As you know building and maintaining a high volume exchange will cost a lot of money. \u201cIncome\u201d currently contains the GAS reward if you hold NEO on Kucoin, Income is also passive revenue if users hold certain kind of asset on Kucoin.\n\n    USER, [22.10.17 01:19]\n    In regards to the calculation in the white paper, it may also be beneficial to have a dividends tab in the assets page to show users how their dividends are being earned and the calculation behind. (I understand that this is a lot of work, and you guys are extremely busy, these things definitely do not get done overnight so do not feel pressured at all)\n\n    Kent Li\u200a\u2014\u200aKucoin\u200a\u2014\u200aOperation Director, [22.10.17 01:20]\n    Ah, actually we have a better plan\n\n    Kent Li\u200a\u2014\u200aKucoin\u200a\u2014\u200aOperation Director, [22.10.17 01:21]\n    There will be a dashboard or report page for users, it will display their profolio on Kucoin, their daily gains & losses, sort of this kind of things\n\n    USER, [22.10.17 01:21]\n    Thank you for that clarification! I\u2019d know like to move onto some suggestions from my readers on the exchange, talking to a great many traders, they all agree that the exchange is better than up to 80% of the exchanges available. It\u2019s intuitive, innovative and user friendly.\n\n    Some points that were brought up were; the non-existence of a \u201cscroll bar\u201d for the order book, which one of your other developers already said you were after more elegant solutions. Others would be including the placement of the chart, some people were saying that it was a little too small.\n\n    USER, [22.10.17 01:22]\n    If you would like to share any plans with me, I would love to include it in my article, and if you could retweet it or pin it on your twitter. I\u2019m sure it will bring a lot of people piece of mind.\n\n    USER, [22.10.17 01:24]\n    It\u2019s definitely understandable that making sudden changes to the UI of the exchange isn\u2019t something to be done over a night, so I\u2019ll definitely highlight that, I think this is just an important step in gaining the trust of the community.\n\n    Kent Li\u200a\u2014\u200aKucoin\u200a\u2014\u200aOperation Director, [22.10.17 01:25]\n    Yeah, things have to done step by step\n\n**If you'll find this helpful, please sign up using my invitation link:** [https://www.kucoin.com/#/signup?r=E3iEp_!](https://www.kucoin.com/#/signup?r=E3iEp_)",

HOGE is Doge, but DeFi - Fun, Deflationary, and may soon be a top 100 coin on CMC. I have never seen such energy, excitement and diverse talent from a community surrounding a crypto. Yes, this coin just did a 50x. But yes, I think it has another 50x in it. The community is nothing short of remarkable. About to be listed on its second exchange. Sponsoring a live race. Donating to animal shelters. NFTs. GameLabs. Like... no other coin has this much action or excitement surrounding it... HOGE took the #4 spot on most popular coins on CMC two days ago, behind BTC, ETH and ADA (1 spot higher than DOGE!). **Yesterday it was #3, above Ethereum.** This is nothing short of amazing for a coin with this small marketcap. It's only $125 to be a HOGE millionaire right now, and holders are increasing rapidly (from 1800 last week Monday, to over 7000 today). We are going to the moon and I hope you come with us! **It's still early.**\n\nFor your enjoyment, here is one of my favorite meme vids so far: https://twitter.com/HogeFinance/status/1368380538814406659\n\n## Details & Socials\n\n- Main Website: [hoge.finance](https://hoge.finance)\n\n- It's ERC20 and trades on Uniswap and WhiteBIT exchange.

The two OG devs are in the Telegram and still involved, but they are really only responsible for the contract (which as others will be quick to point out is a straightforward clone of RFI contract). The website (hoge.finance), gamelabs (hoge.fun), mint (hogemint.com), foundation (legal entity for fundraising & charity), exchange partnerships, rally sponsorship, graphic design, meme competition, etc. are each organized by separate individuals... I guess that is what enables there to be so much diversity / so many things going on at once. For example, I myself have been pretty involved w/ Reddit & Twitter outreach, and moderating a few of the Telegram channels. I also reviewed the website draft, whitepaper draft, and other parts of the HOGE materials thusfar. There are at least 30 folks w/ actual skills that are more involved in this project than I am. \n\n## Combatting the FUD\n\nThe #1 repeated FUD on HOGE is that HOGE is an RFI clone that introduced no new technology, and that most RFI clones are Pump & Dumps. This is true, but it doesn't mean anything... HOGE is not about the technology in its contract, but about the community effort surrounding it. And the community is strong -- they raised $15K out of their own pockets back when HOGE was worth nothing to finance the first exchange listing, and have been developing a TON of supporting content that is completely separate from the original contract. There was already a PnD run by an external group in the early days of the token (first week), but that has been overshadowed completely by the recent run-up, so anyone who was in it for a PnD is out now. All dumps of this coin have been eaten in a matter on minutes... and the price seems to have short-term stabilized at ~0.0001.",

I know how to mine, use faucets and invest in a few coins using websites like kucoin, Kraken, coinbase and of course how to use my wallets but I still don't really understand the key terminologies and what they mean so I find it hard to really get excited about new projects or crypto news when I don't really understand what it means in the first place.\nI've asked a few questions every now and then about certain terms etc. but the replies normally just involve even more words that I don't understand. So, what are some good sources or websites that I can use to broaden my knowledge and get to be more familiar with cryptocurrency? Thanks.",

You may write them on a paper and put it in a safe place only you know, or maybe create a document with all your keys... Although I wouldn't recommend this unless you store that file protected with a password and mainly open it offline.\n\nSome people have backups offline in external devices. That could be another good choice.\n\n\nCustody: a choice that matters.\n\nLet's say you buy some crypto whether because you want to hold or trade them. So you register in an exchange of your trust, put your payment data and buy a bunch of crypto.\n\nNow, here's the key part: what do you do next?\n\nDo you hold your crypto in the exchange or do you transfer them to your private personal wallet?\n\nIn other discussions, a few days ago, the importance of custody was addressed, and the article emphasized: watch out with holding your crypto in an exchange with centralised custody.\n\n\nWhy?\n\nSimply because of the topic mentioned at the beginning of this article: exchanges can be hacked and you can lose all your funds. Thing is the majority of exchanges have a centralised custody system, meaning that you don't own your exchange's wallet private keys. And what happened if you don't own your keys...? Exactly.\n\nTo summarize, be sure you keep your funds safe. Whether it's on your private wallet, or trading in the new generation exchanges that have a transparent custody system, meaning that only you can access your funds and they will be safe in case there's a hack to the exchange.\n\n\nTell me: What's your strategy to secure your funds?",

I\u2019m currently using Bitcoins Vault\u2019s Gold Wallet and it\u2019s really helping me out especially with shopping inconveniences. Also, this way I can get cash back on my cryptos. This isn\u2019t possible using a regular credit/debit card with fiat money.\n\nIn a world where we are progressing towards leaving old ways of payments but still haven\u2019t fully integrated crypto into the market, I think crypto cards would serve as a great transitional way of payment. It will also help push the market into accepting crypto as payments at a faster pace which I\u2019m all in for.",

Luckily I got them to temporarily refund my crypto, they then came back a couple weeks later and wanted to take back my refund. I told them to F off, I already closed my account.\n\nBitpay was better, because I had to load up with bitcoin, they couldn\u2019t just drain my crypto account to pay for unauthorized charges. Still plenty of issues with bitpay, these companies are relatively small, and seem to make plenty of amateur mistakes.\n\nDebit cards in general are not safe.

A lot of value is created through scarcity, tangiblity and usability. \n\nTo create value you must have a market waiting to buy your stuff, or someone who'd be interested. Beeple for example was an already established digital artist that had some of the most unique images in on the internet, he had an audience, his NFTs were obviously gonna gain some worth because there was demand behind them. \n\nMost NFT projects don't have much uses or utility, they have the potential to, but for now they don't. So they're running off of scarcity and mainstream attention from how hard the communities that form around them push them forward. Since the value of NFTs at the moment is not based on artistic finesse or creativity. You can make the best art imaginable and it probably won't gain value on the blockchain unless it's picked up by a community that's passionate about it as much as you are. \n\nCryptopunks for example are considered valuable because\u00a0they represent the first NFT collection ever to be created on the ETH blockchain. The images themselves may not be the prettiest, but the fact that there are only 10,000 Cryptopunks means that very few people can own one. \n\n10 thousand is still a large number considering the NFT collections being sold nowadays, but that market of Cryptopunks was established since they were the original broad project that users could own. And there's value, history and scarcity in that. These brand new \"Celebrity nft\" projects and influencer pushed projects are probably never gonna gain any real value. \n\nWhen venturing into the market, it's wise to not gamble on shady projects. Always check if the team has done anything else before and how that did and so on, before taking a chance and if it's their first project it could be risky, always check if they're backed by an insurance fund like on launchpads such as solprime to insure your safety in case of any rogue tactics or rug pulling like what happened with doodle dragons for example. \n\nOverall, keep a realistic expectation on the projects you're getting into. Anything can be turned into an NFT and there's value in that, but be careful not to overpay for something promising to be the next big thing.",

Most scams are done with shady coins on shady platforms and the victims are usually people who are on the gullible side of the spectrum.\n\nThere are staking options that are pretty safe and can rack in a lot of profits in the long term.

But over the past 2 years it seems like it\u2019s been slowly declining.\n\nHowever I\u2019m starting to see some blockchains focusing again on DeFi development.\n\nProjects like Hedera are bolstering their DeFi development plans yet again with multimillion dollar grants and allocation. HBAR foundation even allocated $155 million just for that purpose and staking will be launching soon as well.\n\nThis has me thinking\u2026 will we experience another mega pump in the DeFi sector towards this upcoming summer?\n\nI\u2019d love to see something like this. Development in the DeFi sector is very important for the future of individuals trying to escape the grips on financial institutions.",

Is there any real risk to posting your wallet address or could these free NFTs somehow contain malware? And as a receiver of these free NFTs do you need to pay gas fees (hopefully polygon anyway).\n\nI would appreciate everyones' thoughts on this topic.",

I want to understand that when I say \"Why pay for a Jpeg , when I can right click and save it\" and people say why does OG monalisa worth billions but fake ones worth pennies.\n\n Well my point is OG Monalisa or any expensive and renowned painting has it's own paint of that time each stroked by an artist. When I take a pic it's a pixelated form of something  that exists in hardcopy and if someone else paints a replica , He is using colours of different brand , texture , combinations  etc which is completely different from the original. \n\nBut in case of a NFT , Hear me out , An artist creates a work , He saves it in HIS DEVICE , Now when he mints it , Does his created work vanishes from his device and places itself in the blockchain. Which implies , the minted work is a copy to begin with. Now when someone buys that NFT and sees it in his device is that the actual digital work made pixel by pixel in the creator's device or is it just a copy of original jpeg. So how is it different if I right click and copy it. If you consider that NFT as original , that begs the question , isn't each and every other person who sees it in his device having an original work. You just only hold the entitlement. \n\nThat's how I consider an NFT different from MONALISA PAINTING.  MONALISA PAINTING's value emphasizes on the creator,  No body cares who holds it , It shall always be MONALISA MADE BY LEONARDO DI VINCI. You can't mix it with another painting to create a MUTANT MONA LISA. It shall always be a masterpiece that was once touched , held , brushed by a Legend. And compring an NFT or JPEG is like comparing a faithful man/woman to a hoe, like A person saying that \" THIS WOMAN SLEEPS WITH MANY DUDES , BUT SHE IS ONLY MY \"WIFE\" \".\n\nSo at the end of the day NFT itself is a first copy of original piece and is just another jpeg but with a self satisfying tag of ownership. Collecting it or selling it is not a scam and No one should stop you from doing it, afterall people collect spoons and pepsi bottle caps. But it's nothing more than a jpeg(A copy )  that has been hyped by the industry. If you are smart earn from it , be rich from it . But it shouldn't be compared  to \"ACTUAL \" and \"ORIGINAL \" MASTERPIECE . \n\n( This opinion of NFT is only limited to holding digital artworks and gifs and photos , I understand that the scope of  NFT is extremely vast and undeniably has importantant purposes in upcoming future )",

The NFT is the token - the code that lives on the blockchain using asymmetric encryption to verify it's legitimacy. Some of these tokens have links to images or whatever - that's what you're thinking of. Whether the image is embedded on the blockchain or linked via IPFS or whatever - it's not the image that you own, it's the token. The token cannot be right-clicked and saved, it has a transaction history backed up by math. The image is absolutely irrelevant to how the NFT works. There is no copyright protection on these tokens - you prove your ownership mathematically on the blockchain. Anyone in the world can save the image your token links to, but they can't take the token.",

The problem is that it\u2019s flawed because it\u2019s a comparison of *physical* content to *digital* content. You have to compare an NFT to *another digital asset* in order to have a true comparison.\n\nNow, at the end of the day NFTs don\u2019t have the same ownership protections and regulations as traditional digital intellectual property, but neither did traditional digital intellectual property when it first came about. The fact that the law hasn\u2019t recognized something *yet* is not a justification for anything. The internet will always move faster than the law. The law *still* hasn\u2019t figured out how the hell to handle copyright and ip yet and the internet is already starting to move on.\n\nNFTs have value for the same reason cash has value or the deed to your house has value. Do you own your house because you have a paper that says so, or do you own your house because you protect it with physical force? If someone threatens you with violence to leave your property do they have a legal right to your house anymore? No, of course not, because the *made up paper* still says it\u2019s yours.\n\nOwnership is messy. Possession is 10/10ths of \u201chaving\u201d something, but that\u2019s not the same as \u201cowning\u201d something.",

You can sell, rent, royalties ...\n\nImagine you created a video that is used in commercials, news... and every time someone sees it, you get money, all transparently, no middle man ...\n\nOr that you create a famous level in minecraft and people pay you 1cent to access it.\n\nArtists will stop being ripped off. Normal people will be able to become artists.",

I feel stupid as until recently I  only knew about her from the stupid gossip press she had in the past,  while she's demonstrating being a serious professional and doing her part in crypto.\n\nThere were in fact [many things I didn't know](https://medium.com/originprotocol/paris-hilton-joins-origin-as-investor-and-advisor-68482acd5ae7)  including she was one of the first ones selling NFTs and is apparently  in crypto since 2015/2016 (?!) \n\nI guess this is a beneficial move for both parties as [OGN's platform](https://www.originprotocol.com/en/litepaper#nftMarketplace) will make it easy for her to launch her NFTs and she'd contribute quite a lot not only with her business experience but also on their mission to bring crypto and NFTs to the masses also thanks to her popularity.\n\nI  guess now that the biggest wave of sensational hype over NFTs has basically gone, we can see what's remaining, the real future use cases  (these are just some example, I've seen real estate and many other sorts of use cases) and how the NFTs are here to stay and will be increasingly a part of our crypto and soon non-crypto life (I think i.e.  NFTs will be soon commonly used as concerts tickets, to buying digital goods for videogames etc).\n\nHere the [news article from the NY post](https://nypost.com/2021/06/08/paris-hilton-invests-in-nft-platform-origin-protocol/)",

            "text": "GET protocol is blockchain ticketing company that has already sold 600k tickets and ticketing companies in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Sout korea use it\n\nHere's my take on why GET protocol's smart and blockchain registered tickets becoming NFT's will revolutionize the ticketing industry.\n\nTicketing + NFT = a match made in heaven. And here\u2019s why:\n\nAs every ticket on the blockchain will become a NFT and thus unqiue, it will allow non custodial ownership of the ticket asset. This gives many interesting advantages but 2 stand out for me personally: P2P ticket trading & DeFi event financing.\n\n**Benifits of NFT tickets on GET Protocol**\n\n* **Merging of the primary and secondary market avoiding scalping and allowing event organizers to receive royalites from resales in the secondary market**\n* **Defi event financing**\n* **Attaching extra premium features to tickets for increased fan engagement, an NFT for attending an event, free poster, single or album with the ticket**\n\n**Mark Cuban already advocated the benefits of NFT ticketing. He sees it as the mass market disruptor**\n\n[https://cryptoslate.com/forget-overvalued-artwork-mark-cuban-sees-nft-ticketing-as-the-mass-market-disruptor/](https://cryptoslate.com/forget-overvalued-artwork-mark-cuban-sees-nft-ticketing-as-the-mass-market-disruptor/)\n\nThis will be the first and only nft ticketing system that will allow ticket trading while at the same time making scalping impossible. Regulators have been struggling for a long time to solve this problem and what seemed impossible to achieve will be made possible by smart contracts! The impact of this will be huge and will change the ticketing space for the better.  \nAdditionally and not unimportantly it will give the event organizer an extra revenue stream. The money that right now for a large part goes to scalpers (the secondary ticket market is worth $15B) will be tapped into by the event organizers.\n\n**Event financing**  \nWithout a doubt one of the most promising and exciting things to look forward to in 2021 is the introduction of decentralized event financing to GET Protocol.  \nEvent organizers often struggle to get financing for their events. This doesn\u2019t only apply to starting artists, but even to famous stars. The artists need to have a lot of capital in advance as they have to pay for the venues, organisation, upfront while only receiving the money after the show is over. Enter GET\u2019s DeFi solution!\n\n>*The pre-financing of events for event-organizers is not a solution looking for a problem; it\u2019s a widely known and used tool that enables event organizers to make the investments needed to get their shows or festivals off the ground.*  \n*In the past we have encountered Event Organizers who select their ticketing partner solely based on the amount of money and loan conditions that they are offered up front.*\n\nThanks to getNFT tickets you\u2019ll be able to pre-finance events of your choice. You can choose to finance new artists (more risk/more APY) or established kpop stars (less risk/less APY).\n\nThis is how it will work:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/d9uxit01xje61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=093877afe2f5b1931c7d2bc4511c946285b2f27d](https://preview.redd.it/d9uxit01xje61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=093877afe2f5b1931c7d2bc4511c946285b2f27d)\n\n*If the concept seems complicated, here\u2019s what you need to understand about GET\u2019s decentralized financing solution:*  \n*1.) Event organizers will be able to easily pre-finance their events. (Something they desperately crave.)*",

            "text": "FINDING GOLD IN THE GLITTER \u2013 HOW NFTS ARE GOING TO IMPACT TICKETING\n\n**GET Protocol's Olivier Biggs cuts through the NFT hype to outline how the live business can harness non-fungible tokens**\n\n It\u2019s not too difficult to draw a comparison between this mountain and the recent NFT hype.\n\nIf you have been consuming any type of media, social or other, chances are you will have heard the term \u2018NFT\u2019 several dozen times over the last few weeks. From Kings of Leon [**releasing their album as an NFT**](https://www.iq-mag.net/2021/03/kings-of-leon-nft-2-million-sales/#.YFIAcLT7Rjc) to sports mogul Ted Leonsis [**naming the benefits of NFTs**](https://twitter.com/TedLeonsis/status/1371824109261352964) in sports to digital artist Beeple [**auctioning off an NFT artwork**](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million) for $69 million through esteemed auction house Christie\u2019s.  \n\n\nNeedless to say, there is a lot of hype around those three letters right now, as everyone begins sticking their shovels into this newly discovered mountain of gold. There seems to be no end to what it can provide; common dirt clusters are suddenly invaluable gems.\n\n>\u201cNFT TICKETING IS A USE CASE WORTH TAKING VERY\u00a0SERIOUSLY\u201d\n\nThe obvious counter-response to a new trend that seems to be making everyone and their mother ridiculous amounts of money without any significant friction is to question its legitimacy.\n\nHowever, simply dismissing NFTs as a fad or a money-grab would be a wasted opportunity. There is indeed merit to it, especially as its application and use cases are developed and fine-tuned.\n\nFor everyone in the entertainment industry, and especially the ticketing business, reading up on the possibilities and potential implementations of NFTs should be required homework.\n\nI\u2019ll explain why we\u2019ve been working on an NFT ticketing approach over the past year at [**GET Protocol**](https://get-protocol.io/), and how we see it shaping the future of events.\n\nBut first, some basics. What is an NFT?\n\n*\u201cThe term is short for non-fungible token and, in plain English, refers to a small digital file \u2013 such as a drawing, a short video clip or even a tweet \u2013 that has been registered as one of a kind, or one of a limited batch, using blockchain software.\u201d* \u2014 [**Decrypt**](https://decrypt.co/60808/so-you-bought-an-nba-top-shot-nft-what-do-you-actually-own)\n\nOver the past few months NFTs have proven themselves useful in allowing digital content creators to take ownership over their craft and content. An artist now no longer relies on intermediaries such as agents, galleries or publishers to get their work in the hands of their (potential) fans.\n\nWhile the headlines are filled with astronomical bidding wars and overnight millionaires, there\u2019s a lot more to it than hot shot auctions and digital art, where most of the hype has originated from thus far.\n\n>\u201cDISMISSING NFTS AS A FAD OR A MONEY-GRAB WOULD BE A WASTED OPPORTUNITY\u201d\n\nNFT ticketing is a use case worth taking *very* seriously. When applied correctly, it enables ticket issuers a variety of benefits that impact and drastically improve the ticketing experience. Both for the fan and the organizer or artist.\n\nHere are three benefits of NFT tickets we are embracing and will be offering to the ticketing companies using GET Protocol. Feel free to copy, tweak or critique them at your own discretion.\n\nA. **Perpetual revenue**  \nSince NFT tickets are programmable, it is possible to introduce a built-in \u2018royalty split\u2019 for any resale on the secondary market. Profit sharing can be tweaked to the liking of the ticket issuer and written into the smart contract code.\n\nFinally, those who actually deliver the value can profit from secondary ticket sales, instead of greedy touts or resale platforms. All without any need for complicated accounting or external parties.\n\nB. **Tickets as collectibles**  \nThis might seem gimmicky, but the sentimental experience of fandom should not be overlooked. Think of a digitised version of sticking the ticket to an unforgettable night on your refrigerator, only with way more possibilities to maximise the memories and cultivate a longstanding connection with a fan.\n\nAs NFTs, tickets can turn into proof-of-attendance badges (we are partnering with [**POAP**](https://www.poap.xyz/) for this purpose) which can be shown off online and even traded. It can also allow you to find and reward your diehard fans who go to every show, for example by sending exclusive content to those fans in possession of a previously issued ticket. The possibilities and variations here are limitless.\n\nC. **Pre-financing of future events**  \nWe are working on a \u2018DeFi\u2019 (decentralised finance \u2013 don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll save that for another blog) approach that will allow event organisers to use their ticket inventory as collateral. This will enable organisers to offer up their (NFT) tickets for investment prior to making any organisational costs.\n\nThis type of crowdfund investing can help organisers mitigate (part of) the risk of setting up a new event. Especially in a post-Covid world, this can be a welcome change. [**Read more about this functionality here**](https://medium.com/get-protocol/decentralizing-event-financing-liquidity-x-defi-x-nfts-975f028135f5).\n\nIf you want to know more about the technical workings of our NFT ticketing approach, I highly recommend this blog: [**Tokenizing the right of entry \u2014 Using NFTs to solve ticket scalping**](https://blog.guts.tickets/tokenize-the-right-of-entry-using-nfts-to-solve-ticket-scalping-b7d241190b10).\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not all rainbows and sunshine. As with all new developments there are certain doubts and downsides being propagated which are worth mentioning briefly.\n\nThe two major counter-arguments heard right now are:\n\n* \u201cIt\u2019s a bubble.\u201d Certainly not every artwork is going to be sold for 69m dollars, nor is every initiative currently being founded and funded going to make a difference in the world. If you are looking to make a quick buck by speculating on NFT artworks, there is an ever-increasing chance that you might be too late and will end up taking a loss. However, if you approach the innovations that are taking place with a curious perspective, you will uncover \u2018game-changer\u2019 elements in many shapes and sizes.\n* \u201cIt\u2019s bad for the environment.\u201d The most (loud) opposing voices use this argument to disqualify NFTs outright. While excessive energy consumption certainly is a factor worth monitoring and combating, there seems to be a lot of misinformation and confusion fuelling this particular train of thought. On top of that, there are several eco-friendly NFT initiatives already out there, and many more on the way. If you want to get a somewhat balanced sense of what this discussion entails, here are two recommendations: [**#1**](https://nonfungible.com/blog/ecological-impact-nfts), [**#2**](https://medium.com/merzazine/cryptoart-and-nft-addressing-environmental-issues-1bfefe6915fa).\n\n[https://www.iq-mag.net/2021/03/finding-gold-glitter-how-nfts-impact-ticketing/#.YFNm7K9KhPZ](https://www.iq-mag.net/2021/03/finding-gold-glitter-how-nfts-impact-ticketing/#.YFNm7K9KhPZ)",

Of course a lot of people were so desperate that they started to buy up those tickets too which has resulted in massive outrage, legal-illegal disputes and tons of loss for both the team and the fans. I would love to see this getting solved and then I didn't mention the proof of ownership in other heavily scalped products, like the new gen consoles or GPUs etc...\n\nAnd before someone wouldn't like that I have mentioned GPUs or consoles, one of my friends is the IT manager in a hungarian hospital and they don't have the money to buy hardware for crucial life saving equipment due to the inflated prices. Right now scalpers buy EVERYTHING up which has any significant demand, doesn't matter what it is. Also \"not in the first world or west\" laws don't really control retail companies either about their prices, so they do their best to match the scalper prices, so you can't really have it cheaper anywhere right now.\n\nIt's not just about gamers and miners, sport fans whatever, but schools, hospitals and such which are also having a very hard time.",

Also by what I read from both team members' statements it looks like they're cooking together something cool for the future.\n\nThese projects have both [strong fundamentals, goals, long-term plans](https://www.originprotocol.com/en/litepaper) and exceptional teams coming from top-notch Silicon Valley giants (that some of them have literally contributed to build).\n\nI  had a blast following the last NFT live auction where bidders were 'fighting' in order to overbid each other during the last minutes of the auction, it went from like under $100,000 to over $760,000 in a bunch  of minutes.\n\nThis is cool already but I think is only starting to show the surface of a much bigger potential for their NFT tech use cases and it's great these excellent teams are working together.\n\nI am confident we will hear about them both many times again and for a long time in the crypto space. Brave as the greatest Browser and the first with a great rewards system for their users through BAT and Origin Protocol as NFT leaders and among DeFI top 10 projects (OUSD worth a mention here, look it up if you don't know it, it changed completely my view on stable coins).\n\nThe [TABONG auction](https://tabong.brave.com/#/) will start next week, the 9th of June at 12pm PDT and will last only 30 mins so check when it happens on your time zone ([more info here](https://medium.com/originprotocol/brave-launches-origin-powered-store-8288d9ce8fd0)). As of now, apart of one or two items, the prices seem something also small investors might be able to afford so i might try to bid, you never know, although I know that can escalate very quickly as it happened during some previous auctions.\n\nI  am setting a reminder and if you're intrigued by the future of NFTs and these projects I suggest you do that too to watch how this works. It's good eeven just to get familiar with the process, soon this could be the standard  for many NFT product sales.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cWe\u2019ve  been able to bring some excellent web3 utility cases to market through   our partnership with Origin; from crypto payments with BAT and ETH   through the Brave Store, to NFT sales through our BAT Community. We\u2019re   very excited to collaborate with Origin on the *TABONG* NFT sale, and look forward to collaborating even more with Origin on future projects.\u201d \u2014 **Luke Mulks, VP Business Ops, Brave**  \n\u201cWe\u2019re ecstatic to deepen our partnership with Brave with the *TABONG*   NFT sale. As the NFT market rapidly expands from cryptocurrency early   adopters to more mainstream audiences, we\u2019re excited to work with Brave   on bringing innovative NFT use cases to Brave\u2019s 32M+ user base.  Brave\u2019s  commitment to a privacy-centric and decentralized web are  perfectly  aligned with our aspirations to enable creators to engage and  interact  directly with their fans and collectors through NFTs.\u201d **\u2014 Matthew Liu, Cofounder, Origin Protocol**",

            "text": " NFT, a concept that created hype around Digital Art, is ready to move forward, of course taking art with it. One such destination is an event market where NFT can bridge the best parts of physical and digital ticketing.\n\nMany of you might remember old school tickets that people used to collect. Each ticket was unique, bringing up special memories whether it was a large music festival in California, an opera night in Vienna or maybe a World Cup in Brazil.\n\nDigitalization made tickets functional but boring with just simple QR codes without any story behind them. Tickets started missing the memory part, something that people wanted to store and even take with them when they travel or move. Memories that they reflect on remembering every special moment from past events. NFT is coming to the game to make tickets memorable and even more functional.\n\nYou can lose a paper ticket, it can get wet, old and ruined. It's also hard to travel with it and such memories are being simply lost. Organizers are also not getting enough security with paper-based tickets as they can easily be faked. QR codes seemed to be a good answer for organizers to make ticketing effective but not as good for the guests purchasing them. With NFT there's no need to compromise as the technology enables both making tickets memorable and functional.\n\n**NFT technology allows organizers to:**\n\n1) Validate the authenticity of every ticket and verify the owner (especially for private and VIP events where a ticket should be linked to the specific guest).\u00a0\n\n2) Create art-like tickets representing the event's story and brand that people would love to collect.\n\n3) Access powerful data to make subsequent events better.\n\n4) Include special perks and engage with the community, give additional incentives to those frequently attending events.\n\n5) Pre-sell drinks, food, and other packages to minimise the waiting line.\n\n6) Send outstanding event invites to VIP guests and members.\n\nThis list will continue to grow as NFT technology enables simpler and edgy ways to interact with event guests and sponsors.\n\n**It also opens new opportunities for guests:**\n\n1) Store art-like tickets safely to keep all memories close.\n\n2) Engage and feel a part of favourite event organizers' communities\u00a0\n\n3) Receive special perks and incentives from organizers.\n\n4) Sell valuable and rare past event tickets that other people would love to collect.\n\n5) Easily sell tickets for upcoming events that you suddenly can't go to.\n\nLarge festivals can now issue tickets in collaboration with digital artists to bring a greater value to their guests and community.\n\nSport organizers also benefit from the new way of ticketing. Imagine your favourite football club issuing a ticket with some memorable moment from the game or maybe featuring a famous player. Such tickets become collectable with extra value and are now available to fans everywhere even if they couldn't attend the game themselves.\n\nNFTs can also make invitations for family events special. Imagine turning your 5-year-old's drawing into an NFT invitation for her birthday party. Marvellous, isn't it?\n\nThe market is definitely awaiting some interesting changes with art-like tickets being a part of them.\u00a0",

And their numbers are doing pretty well... So the idea is already there and being implemented.\nSo why won\u2019t the major gaming companies get on the same train ? It\u2019s a win win for everyone.

It's been a good ride for them since that time, hitting multiple partnerships, bringing in more investors and creating a totally different play to earn narrative.\n \n**Recently**:\n\n\u2713The Exeedme platform hosted the Polkastater CSGO tournament which featured four projects battling it out in CSGO combat.\n\n\u2713Hosted a 24hr league on it's platform powered by SPIDER DAO.\n\n\u2713Exeedme partnered with Beefy finance; hodlers and liquidity providers can now automatically farm XED on pancakeswap.

            "text": "So as a principle, I want to invest in projects that are building for the future as well, not those hyped temporarily.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe ones I have in mind are:\n\nADA (Cardano), you all know it I suppose, doesn't need much introduction, I will just say it has got some very interesting [partnerships with some countries'](https://cryptobriefing.com/cardano-expands-influence-africa-sparking-new-interest-ada/) institutions lately and not many can say the same, these guys may really be with us for decades. Though now it is on an uptrend for some time already and I am a bit afraid entering at this stage. On the other hand, thinking long-term, could be just about deciding yes or no, rather than when.\n\nOGN (Origin Protocol), a less known one but a well-respected project that's building very interesting and innovative products in DeFi (OUSD, a stable coin that makes you earn just by holding it in your wallet with no further actions required from users; a connected debit card plus mobile app was announced as [future products in their litepaper](https://www.originprotocol.com/en/litepaper)), in NFT (NFT launchpad for artists and celebrities [already successful](https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/origin-protocol-3lau-nft/) and NFT marketplace for everyone is on its way) and in E-commerce (a decentralized Shopify that cuts out middleman fees) which is already a big thing itself, considering how big is getting the market for that. The core team all come from first-class internet/tech companies (Yu Pan, PayPal founder with Elon Musk, is their founding engineer, just to name one as the cherry on the cake) and seem working hard to deliver, no frills. It also looks like the team is recently working kind of silently on something and so, the price retraced quite a bit from their last ATH (which also came with the next news after a long silence) and, unlike for how it is going now with Cardano, it could be a good entry point. I really see the products they're building as products that could be part of daily lives in a few years.\n\nThe last one I am considering for this investment is CHZ (Chiliz), these guys are those that launched the football (soccer) fan tokens BCN, JUV etc.). I do not even follow football but I think it could get big since football is already enough big even just considering only EU, but seeing they're expanding to other sports (they already announced getting also in [UFC](https://www.chiliz.com/en/ufc-and-chiliz-announce-global-partnership/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=666cad5d22f0262fc377064e79c3cb9932f08998-1620646219-0-AeeMcUxBooTsIXGc8WRKcnF0OlehxEbVmWY7cvlkcyC8oveK2b7dn-uIavypREDSxPGf5kFRGCnxfOjr0XTVUZu5fnMR6lrIGLYL3XTZxf3ofuNL7nVHlg04b8F2NqQ-m8F7shpTVfaHktmRODueqkrOqwBcPJXRSjUILjROlr6P6wPHwC2oaflZZG8g8pLPkFMRFGNq6hHIHlDuPSWoA1_eWz4lEWUuWf8-9YdFsMqN7Yk4hs9UPEt_tCcCEwkOhKvST5PMs5lM5ibFScjuKTxECjH0b7odzsjwaodVJ1a98Ue0C-diKlpgz2hhojR3mAnJxhC6EDKFY1jR1HpK0qPxqh-IVvuPeychgSX7eWkTWK0LRb2iJugJL47DQjMBMQOKoD_UOvp0SQ94X-D_wUaqmz6h-1RFNFic6YA9TTFi_ErcLtVke4w2t9Ok4J_Gd1cdXN1BvKklYyxoc2cEJkk) and F1), I suspect at some point they'll announce partnerships with some american football/baseball/basketball team or entire leagues, and then it could really skyrocket. Please note those are all sports for the masses, supporters of these teams are willing to spend more than what they can just to go to the matches or just watch them on TV, imagine when they discover they can influence their fav teams' decisions by buying their tokens and then voting knowing that the more tokens, the more power of course, and they love to have a voice in their team's decisions. Am I watching correctly at this one?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know there are many projects but these are the ones I am considering at the moment so please let's focus on these ones only (MEANS ONLY THOSE I MENTIONED!

            "text": "I hope this isn\u2019t too tech heavy and I\u2019ll answer any questions as best as I can. [BogTools](https://bogtools.io/) is a BSC protocol which provided oracles. These oracles are fully decentralised and work on-chain, and every time someone buys or sells the native token $BOG, it triggers the oracles to execute the code in their smart contracts. This means they can be used in a number of ways:\n\n* **DEX Limit Order Trading**: Being able to set a certain price for your BSC buy or sell order to execute and set \"Take Profit\" or \"Stop Loss\" -\\*orders for any BSC coin on a decentralised exchange like PancakeSwap, not aware of anyone doing this on BSC right now. This will be available April 2nd!\n* [BogRNG](https://docs.bogtools.io/getting-random-numbers): The way this works can get confusing, but it's essentially a random number generator which developers can use to build on-chain casinos, lotteries and games that need randomness.\n* **BogCharts**: Using the oracles to get price data, the devs have already launched a [beta](https://www.reddit.com/submit#price) version of this for the BOG/USD pair and are aiming to create a free-to-use chart service for any and all BSC coins that displays truly live prices.\n* **NFT Marketplace**: Yep, they're also doing NFTs. Their goal is to try to integrate \ttheir NFT marketplace with the oracles and use them to execute contracts allowing for the NFTs to have a use and to be gamified rather than just having speculative value.\n* [BogARG](https://bogged.finance/): Alternate Reality Game. More on gamification, the devs have made the trading and staking of BOG into a game called Bogged. Every time you sell BOG your wallet gets stained with a shame token, $NGMI (Never Gonna Make It) which is permanent, as in it cannot be traded. This will bring the holder in a disadvantageous positions in further phases of the ARG.\n\nYou can find the tokenomics and the rest of the details and facts either on [BogTools](https://bogtools.io/) or on the ARG website [bogged.finance](https://bogged.finance/), I just want to make a reference to the market cap at the time of writing to compare with other projects.\n\nSo the native token, $BOG's **market cap** is currently just above **$20M, and a circulating supply of \\~2,390,000 BOG**. In terms of competitors, I guess Berry Data can still be considered BOG's competitor. However, when one takes into account that BOG has released more fully functioning oracle products in 2 weeks of life than BRY has in over 6 months, not to mention that yesterday BOG surpassed BRY's market cap and then some easily, you'd start to think that BOG doesn't really have any competitive challengers on BSC.  Comparisons can be made with ChainLink as well, however the fact that ChainLink is running on the ETH network makes using their services several times more expensive than using BOG's oracles, with BogTools having a much more ease-of-use approach to the whole ecosystem. ChainLink obviously has the backing of institutional money at this point, but that is irrelevant to the quality of the product itself.\n\nIt\u2019s still a small community so help us build it together while we revolutionise BSC.\n\nFor more info and resources check [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BogTools/comments/mbc7wb/bogtools_introduction_links_and_resources/).

They had a fair distribution and airdropped 45% of their supply to 500 people without any presale, while allocating another 45% for staking rewards. Total supply is 28,000 $NDR.\n\nIt is a cyberpunk themed blockchain game, where Heroes must fight Villains to regain control over the fallen world. Project's website and visuals are really good.\n\nSame as with $MEME, you farm Hero NFTs by providing liquidity, but Node Runners added staking and gamification elements to it, like fighting Villains. When you beat the Villain, you claim his card and stake it too to earn even more $NDR (native token).\n\nThey also added LG feature from $CORE - 90% of ETH received from NFTs sale is used to buy back NDR from the market and lock liquidity forever.\n\nEach token transfer also has a 2% tax/fee which is also allocated For NFT staking rewards.\n\nIt already has about 100k in liquidity on Uniswap and NFT cards are already being minted by Liquidity providers with staking beginning this Monday.\n\nLooks like a really cool project to me and something that is likely to do well.\n\nKey points\n\nStaking rewards: 45% of the total supply (or 12,600 $NDR)\n\nStaking rewards #2: each $NDR transaction includes a 2% fee which is allocated for NFT staking rewards\n\nJust over 100k circ.m. cap as of now\n\nIf anyone has any thoughts about this project, let's discuss\n\nHere is a link to their Medium For more Information : [https://noderunners.medium.com/](https://noderunners.medium.com/)  \nRoad map: [https://noderunners.medium.com/node-runners-roadmap-2e65897a7b26](https://noderunners.medium.com/node-runners-roadmap-2e65897a7b26)  \nWebiste: [https://noderunners.io/home](https://noderunners.io/home)",

Luckily the Cointelegraph made it easier for us:  \n\n\n\"Origin released its official \"Litepaper\" on March 17, and the document details how the Origin NFT launchpad **will allow users to build their own marketplace with custom landing pages and dynamic auction formats.**\n\nThe protocol claimed to have successfully auctioned the **world\u2019s first tokenized album** by Electronic music producer 3LAU and the **sale generated $11.6 million in 24 hours.** \n\nOrigin also\u00a0tweeted an NFT drop on **Origin\u2019s NFT Launchpad by Grammy Award-Winning  Multi-Platinum Musician Lupe Fiasco that will go live on April 12.**\n\nIn an AMA session with Binance China, Origin\u2019s co-founder Matthew Liu said the protocol plans to include **NFT drops and bonuses for OGN holders in the future.**\n\nIn addition to NFTs, the protocol is planning to develop **payment apps and launch an Origin USD debit card.** \n\nThe  launch of OGN staking on Binance from March 4 and the recent **inclusion  of OGN as a collateral asset on Cream Finance** could also be attracting  investors to the project.\"  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ny7rpbo4ncq61.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=52cf02cf286a4fc1aac450e7c387a1afd7aef289",

            "text": " \n\nGET protocol is blockchain ticketing company that has already sold 600k tickets and ticketing companies in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Sout korea use it\n\nHere's my take on why GET protocol's smart and blockchain registered tickets becoming NFT's will revolutionize the ticketing industry.\n\nSo what\u2019s a NFT exactly? NFT stands for non fungible token. This is a token that\u2019s unique on the blockchain and not mutually interchangeable. This in contrast to for example Bitcoin where it doesn\u2019t matter which Bitcoin you have (1 BTC = 1 BTC). Every ticket issued by the GET protocol will become a getNFT.\n\nEventhough GET\u2019s NFT\u2019s will be the most used, bought & traded NFT\u2019s in the crypto space the goal isn\u2019t to ride the hype. Ticketing + NFT = a match made in heaven. And here\u2019s why:\n\nAs every ticket on the blockchain will become a NFT and thus unqiue, it will allow non custodial ownership of the ticket asset. This gives many interesting advantages but 2 stand out for me personally: P2P ticket trading & DeFi event financing.\n\n**Benifits of NFT tickets on GET Protocol**\n\n* **Merging of the primary and secondary market avoiding scalping**\n* **Defi event financing**\n* **Attaching extra premium features to tickets for increased fan engagement, an NFT for attending an event, free poster, single or album with the ticket**\n\nThis will be the first and only nft ticketing system that will allow ticket trading while at the same time making scalping impossible. Regulators have been struggling for a long time to solve this problem and what seemed impossible to achieve will be made possible by smart contracts! The impact of this will be huge and will change the ticketing space for the better.  \nAdditionally and not unimportantly it will give the event organizer an extra revenue stream. The money that right now for a large part goes to scalpers (the secondary ticket market is worth $15B) will be tapped into by the event organizers.\n\n**Event financing**  \nWithout a doubt one of the most promising and exciting things to look forward to in 2021 is the introduction of decentralized event financing to GET Protocol.  \nEvent organizers often struggle to get financing for their events. This doesn\u2019t only apply to starting artists, but even to famous stars. The artists need to have a lot of capital in advance as they have to pay for the venues, organisation, upfront while only receiving the money after the show is over. Enter GET\u2019s DeFi solution!\n\n>*The pre-financing of events for event-organizers is not a solution looking for a problem; it\u2019s a widely known and used tool that enables event organizers to make the investments needed to get their shows or festivals off the ground.*  \n*In the past we have encountered Event Organizers who select their ticketing partner solely based on the amount of money and loan conditions that they are offered up front.*\n\nThanks to getNFT tickets you\u2019ll be able to pre-finance events of your choice. You can choose to finance new artists (more risk/more APY) or established kpop stars (less risk/less APY).\n\nThis is how it will work:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/d9uxit01xje61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=093877afe2f5b1931c7d2bc4511c946285b2f27d](https://preview.redd.it/d9uxit01xje61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=093877afe2f5b1931c7d2bc4511c946285b2f27d)\n\n*If the concept seems complicated, here\u2019s what you need to understand about GET\u2019s decentralized financing solution:*  \n*1.) Event organizers will be able to easily pre-finance their events. (Something they desperately crave.)*  \n*2.) Investors will be able to invest in events of their choice, at a risk & reward level that they feel comfortable with.*  \n*3.) The $GET token is an integral part of the financing process, as it is required for \u2018skin in the game\u2019 from*\n\nThe advantage event financing for GET token holders will bring is again twofold:\n\n1. As a GET holder you\u2019ll be able to finance events and share in the profit of the ticket sales. This means that GET will allow you to profit without selling = passive income. An important note is that this is profit without inflation. While other DeFi projects give you returns by increasing the supply (and thus decreasing the value of the token) the returns here will not increase the GET supply, as the returns come from real profit(ticket sales).\n2. As the GET token will be an integral part of this process, it will:  \n\\- increase the buy pressure of the GET token (everyone who wants to participate will need GET)  \n\\- decrease the supply (everyone who participates will have to locks his GET tokens).\n\nFor a deeper insight I recommend the blog below:\n\n[https://medium.com/get-protocol/decentralizing-event-financing-liquidity-x-defi-x-nfts-975f028135f5](https://medium.com/get-protocol/decentralizing-event-financing-liquidity-x-defi-x-nfts-975f028135f5)\n\nand checking the website\n\n[https://get-protocol.io/](https://get-protocol.io/)\n\nAvailable on uniswap:\n\n[https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)",

            "text": "Hello everyone, I have been reporting on the state of a selection of crypto-assets for a while and thought I would share my insight with you all on the upcoming week for Litecoin.\n\nIn my research and reporting process, I seek to clarify the fundamental value that underpins an asset and then I use Technical Analysis and hard-data in the form of certain metrics to help me identify converging or diverging information points.\n\nI have a background in data-science and work hard to provide a fair, impartial and unbiased report.\n\nI am not here to rub egos or soothe nerves but I am here to provide the data in a way that offers a meaningful insight that can be actioned accordingly if people find it useful for their particular portfolio situations.\n\nOn that note, let's get down to it.\n\n\\--------------------------\n\nFundamental Analysis:\n\nThere is only one fundamental piece of information that I seek to ascertain whether a project has legitimate value and that is to find out if the project has a real world application.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nIf a project has a real world application then it often has a marketable underlying value that can be fiscally exploited and so, in this case, we look at Litecoin and we have to ask, what is the most simple fundamental piece of information that we can see that shows us that Litecoin has value?\n\nThe answer is quite simple, it's a value-store platform and so, it is basically a digital bank without the bells and whistles where a person can store their wealth in LTC tokens and trade those tokens in a speculative move on the open market if they wish to do so.\n\nMost projects fall in to only a few categories and they are:\n\n1. Value Storage - It says it in the name, a provider of storage where you can store your fiat in a digital crypto format.\n2. Service Provider - Exchanges are service providers as they provide access to the markets for \"end users\", this applies to centralised crypto-exchanges and DEXs.\n\nAnother form of a service provider are gambling organisations that allow you to risk crypto-tokens on games of chance and so, these too are service providing projects.\n\nYet another form of service provider can be found in the burgeoning NFT sector, these projects are most often gaming platforms that use cNFTs that provide an in-game economy/ecosystem that still allows your assets to be exposed to the risk of the markets. A good example of this is ALICE (My Neighbour Alice) which is already listed on Binance but the game is due to launch in January 2022. Again, these types of projects all provide a service which directly benefits an end user and so they can be classed as having a real world use.\n\n3) Scam-coin - The oh so wonderfully notorious scam-coins that are often the \"go-to\" coin of choice for pump & dump groups, these coins have no value other than the fact they are used to \"legitimately defraud\" gullible traders of their money in what is nothing more than just a digital confidence scam. Sure there are more extreme cases of \"exit scams\" and digital Ponzi schemes.\n\nSo having established the three major groupings that projects can fall in to and since Litecoin has no clear service use, it falls under the \"value-storage\" grouping so we can now make a few assumptions such as it having the ability to always make money over the long-term.\n\nI can already hear you all now questioning my sanity on my previous statement but it's true.\n\nAny project that doesn't automatically find it's way in to being a pump and dump asset will invariably make a person money with the only real question being \"how long until the ROI is achieved?\"\n\nI assume you would like me to put a few supporting cases in place now eh?\n\nWhy not!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/evx4zl6wf0r61.png?width=2275&format=png&auto=webp&s=f773cff6da0e59ba4ef54f848345a93d556f11a4\n\nZIL/USDT\n\nZIL is one of those \"low end\" projects that has always been thought of as a \"dead-end\" and only there for the pump and dump or the low-cap traders/investors but if you had bought in on ZIL when it first launched and rode the derision of holding ZIL and being called silly amongst other things, you would be better off to the tune of 1010% at today's price.\n\nLet's find another project.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/keey2dywf0r61.png?width=2269&format=png&auto=webp&s=afd1738928bf5ee182b746c545b20bfe96cd1fc6\n\nVET/USDT\n\nVET was another project that had a reputation of being an asset that no serious trader/investor wanted a part of yet if you bought in on launch and sold at today's price, you would have netted a 331% return on investment.\n\nLet's scrape the barrel and find one more project shall we?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lvqtsdixf0r61.png?width=2269&format=png&auto=webp&s=572b30cee87478bb9d2ad1fc8ce83bfa2f743b57\n\nONE/USDT\n\nNeed I say much about this project? No-one thought it was going anywhere (yes the pun was intended and no I couldn't help it, I doubt any-one could resist....insert round of applause here).\n\nStill, if you had bought a bunch of these tokens and sold at today's price, it would have netted you 1224% on your investment.\n\nThe common denominator on these projects is not how bad or good they were, it was time and the fact that each coin fell in to the \"value storage\" grouping.\n\nOnce you have identified a project that you believe has potential and you've put money in to that project in the form of buying their tokens, it becomes a question of time to realise a profit and this is where 95% of traders fall flat and the reason why holding any and all crypto is always the most profitable strategy by far.\n\nNow I have hopefully shown you that projects, no matter how good or bad (unless they are scam coins) all eventually get their day to be a king, I'll end this section by offering one further piece of \"wisdom\". A majority of coins will accrue some kind of value over their lifetime and you will be hard-pressed to identify many projects that have been listed and crashed out of the market due to a complete loss of value with the caveat to this being that projects will usually be delisted because of a lack of liquidity/volume but the point still holds, I am not aware of any project that can be assigned to groups 1 and 2 that have lost all value and those projects that are de-listed on the basis of liquidity/volume are usually the projects that fall in to group 3 (scam coins).\n\nHopefully I have done a good job up to this point on showing you my rationale with regards to the markets and trading/investing.\n\nLet's get back to Litecoin shall we?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6u97sv6yf0r61.png?width=2273&format=png&auto=webp&s=53d9e8342a7397e9ede85ed3599b7491cdc00afe\n\nLitecoin has had a volatile number of weeks seeing the price move up and down but all of that action has been part of an overall uptrend as denoted by the fact that the price action remains very much above the median line of the Bollinger Band. For those that are not too familiar with a Bollinger Band, price action above the median line is considered an uptrend and price action below the median line is considered a downtrend. Alongside this, the floor and roof of the Bollinger Band act as mobile levels of support and resistance, a good example of this is the price action 6 and 7 weeks ago that exceeded the roof of the Bollinger Band, this is always seen as an over-extension of the price and this was heavily rejected 5 weeks ago which saw a loss of 75% of the momentum LTC had gained on the previous two weeks.\n\nAlongside the Bollinger Band, I have set up two lines (pink), the first denotes where the current level of support for LTC is at but this has yet to be tested and confirmed as solid, instead, it can be seen as a pivot point by being both a support point and resistance point with it only being confirmed as a solid point of support if the support level is tested in the new trading week.\n\nTo add to these chart lines, I also use a Fib Retracement and Extension tool with the retracement tool providing me a confirmation that the placement of the extension tool is correct.\n\nWhat we can see here is that the 0% to 23.6% range on the Fib Retracement and Extension tools creates a continues zone of trading that is essentially one large pivot point for the current price action where by if the price breaks back below $203 then we have a frame of reference in which to place our expectations at where the price will most likely be supported. However, if the price holds above $203 and continues to trade in the pivot zone then it is to be taken as a move of consolidation until it breaches the 23.6% line on the Fib Extension marker where it would then denote a move of the price in to a growth run which will most likely make the 50% marker at a minimum.\n\nAs it stands, the price action is close to what I call the \"reversal point\" whereby the price may slip in to a heavy form of retracement but with 24 hours still yet to go before the close of the week, the \"game\" is still wide open.\n\nNext up, I use the RSI and StochRSI indicators as part of a \"single\" indication setup where I can look for divergent or convergent action. A divergent state between the indicators exist if they both occupy opposite ends of the spectrum (overbought and oversold) as this is a strong indication of loss of momentum which results in a consolidation move where as if both indicators where in overbought or oversold territory then we would know with some certainty that either a \"buy-up\" or \"sell-off\" will ensue but as good traders will tell you, don't rely on single indications, the more indications you can get, the stronger the conclusion you can draw from the situation becomes and so, I will often use a MACD to confirm the insight provided by the RSI and StochRSI indicators.\n\nThe MACD does show a marked slowdown of positive trading pressure on the histogram as it moves closer towards a neutral setting in lieu of moving to a negative pressure setting and the two moving averages have constricted to the point that they are close to a crossover situation which would denote a change of momentum but as the MACD still retains a marginal positive structure, I would draw the conclusion that a move towards consolidation is the most likely outcome at this point in time.\n\nIt's worth quickly mentioning that I do have three moving averages set up as well to support my conclusions on trend trading and so these are set to 12, 26 and 52 weeks (3, 6 and 12 months).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Mighty Depth Chart](https://preview.redd.it/75ksgj3zf0r61.png?width=2270&format=png&auto=webp&s=10625090bef41de75dc9bb2ad3ece599de16d370)\n\nI use the depth chart to gauge the overall state of the market and the action closer to the active price point. Now, I can already hear people saying \"you're an idiot, you can't trust the depth chart\" and to that I say...well obviously you can't duh! However, the depth chart still provides some useful insights even though we know it can be manipulated by whales and only provides level one data which is data on live limit buy and sell orders and doesn't include the more technical orders like trailing stops, OCOs or even \"bot triggered orders\" and so, we have to use the depth chart as though we are half blind but even a half blind person can still see their surroundings and is aware of what is around them. This is the fashion in which I use the depth chart.\n\nOn the state of the overall market, the buyer to seller ratio is currently at 1.6:1 in favour of sellers overall which means that LTC has a bit of a fight on it's hands if it wishes to stretch further up the price ladder but having said that, there is more on an insight that can be gleaned the further we go in to the depth chart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rko5lp10g0r61.png?width=2273&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d4c669db28efeb5f53751778557c943682ae94d\n\nDespite sellers having overall control of the market, we can see that buyers actually are in control of the active price point by a somewhat decent margin, this generally denotes a strong resistance to any price pullback and so, in conjunction with our knowledge that consolidation is the most likely course of action, we can now say that the consolidation won't have any significant downward momentum but again, we must take this with a pinch of salt because the state of things can move fast and the data can be manipulated to a certain extent but again, I find this useful to reinforce any conclusion that I may draw.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y4868so0g0r61.png?width=1075&format=png&auto=webp&s=5400eca0596ebfdf6f67a5e3e925cc01ed86d89a\n\nNext on my list of tools is the price-to-sales ratio which gives a really good and quick insight in to the state of an asset's price. Any ratio over 1:1 is to be considered over-priced where as anything under 1:1 is to be considered under-priced. This ratio really is useful as again it adds to our overall conclusion and by knowing that the PSR is indicating that the price of LTC has stretched a little too far, it most likely means that a pullback/consolidation is the next most likely move over the coming week.\n\nLast but not least, we have my summary.\n\nTrade Action over the next seven days - $203 to $215\n\nLong-term Forecast - $463 by the end of December this year (derived by a simple linear projection based on previous price action, this get's updated with each major/significant move in price).\n\nMarket Condition - Bullish/Consolidation\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully some of you may find this useful/helpful and just so you guys and gals know, I also run reports for seven other projects which includes: BTC, ETH, BNB, 1INCH, LINK, DOT and UNI which I release via my Patreon page so if you think that you may benefit from some of the insights I provide then please feel free to come on over and join me on my Patreon at [https://www.patreon.com/isce](https://www.patreon.com/isce)\n\nThank you for reading and I hope you all have a profitable end to the trading week!",

I personally find it very convenient (ok that wasn't difficult, it just increase in numbers in your wallet by doing nothing, unlike DAI, USDC or anything else AFAIK).   \nAnyway lately with the gas price getting more and more expensive, some people were saying it was too expensive to mint and use OUSD, and I guess the team listened to the users call and just [released a new litepaper](https://www.originprotocol.com/en/litepaper#ousd) that explains new plans for OUSD other than other info on their Dshop and their governance token OGN. \n\nI minted as much OUSD as I could since quite the beginning and honestly I do not understand why I'm not reading about it everywhere, maybe need more marketing and I hope this helps spreading a bit the voice and I think once the cross-chain plans are done and the payments on traditional platforms are out, this can easily be the most used stable coin. I mean again, i kept my gains often for months in other stable coins, once I even forgot some in a wallet for a year or so...well I'd have gotten some free money from that and without the need of any lock period, like when you forget some $$$ in your winter jacket and find it the next year lol. But nope they were not OUSD, will not make that mistake again, but now I am digressing I guess. And as for the payments on traditional platforms, I'd be able to buy stuff online with those forgotten money, just perfect.\n\nNow, I am not a merchant, but if you're, you really should have a look at what they do as these guys are getting you all covered with either a decentralized commerce platform that sets you free, much more convenient payments system and many other benefits.",

So it's **NFT + DeFi + gaming**, quite cool if you ask me.  \nThis week they are releasing their **updated NFT staking contract**, which will **allow for partners' NFT staking**  \\- for example, MEME holders might be able to stake their NFTs and earn  $NDR; this essentially gives additional utility to the partners' NFTs!  \nNode  Runners NFTs are gaining momentum - on Friday they revealed a new  Legendary Hero Satoshi Nakamoto, only 7 copies, all of which were sold  out in under 60 seconds.  \nThey also have $NDR farms, 4 of them, with **APY ranging from 350% to 500%**.  Partnership with Matic Network has been secured to make fighting  Villains free of gas, which is also a great perk. Lots of cool stuff  about this project, and the team is very responsive and productive -  DYOR.  \nSome numbers:  \n**Total supply:** 28K with 14.7K still locked in staking rewards  \n**Mcap:** still under 400K  \n**Liquidity:** 90% of all NFTs sales proceeds are used to buy back NDR and lock liquidity  \n**Team tokens:** 5%",

What I found was the keyword **NFT**.\n\nThe increase of the price began at the end of Feb, start of March and to have a clear picture of that, here is the chart taken by tradingview.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ivg5k5akqjr61.png?width=1246&format=png&auto=webp&s=38c63881d46612ffb87faee135a1d766cd71d479\n\nAs the price was stable and the token was traded at around $0.15- $0.22 you can see that a huge bull run started and I tried to found out what happened at this project at that period of time.\n\nWhat I found is that a bug artist named 3LAU made an auction for some unique NFTs of his album with the help of Origin Protocol and raised around $11.7m. Of course the increase from that point is also aided by the momentum of the market as everything is going up during the last month.\n\nTo conclude with, I just wanted to point out that this was just a \"pump\" of just one auction in an NFT protocol like Origin's. Maybe other projects will also follow such growths in the future and OGN will be the example.\n\nDo you believe that this NFT auction was the real reason of this pump or it is something else that pushed the price  -not releated with the NFT Space?",

Maybe rather look at the next upcoming ones as the next artist is even much more followed than the previous, if we want to remain on the NFT topic.\n\nBut again, OGN is operating much more widely:\n\n\\- Getting among the leaders in NFTs\n\n\\- Still working on products with real-life use cases such as Dshop which is just at its beginning with that.\n\n\\- Keeping on improving their 'smart' stable coin OUSD and working in a way that all their products will bring benefits to OGN hodlers\n\nJust a few things off of my head...is NFT somehow related, it must be, but it's the solid long term and steady work IMO bringing lasting results also in terms of price.",

            "text": "**WHAT IS NFT?**\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are cryptocurrency assets on a blockchain in which each token is unique. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, NFT cannot be exchanged but can be used as Art. Hence the word Non-Fungible. They can be bought on the NFT market and can get tracked on their blockchains. NFTs are created by uploading a file to an NFT auction market which produces a hash of the file on blockchain as an NFT and can then be bought and resold with cryptocurrency. NFT usually has very little data stored in it. But it contains details which are links to where Art about it is preserved. As an NFT buyer, you do not have exclusive access to the work also, the original file will not be in your possession. Anyone can upload an NFT work. You do not necessarily have to be the original artist to upload a file. Even though NFTs would be favored for their authenticity, over a hundred copies can be made from it and then sold.\n\nThe NFTs artwork possesses similarities to autographed works because of its uniqueness. NFTs can be offered as collectibles in a digital form. Several popular brands have used NFT over time. In 2019, Nike created a system that would use NFT called Cryptokicks to verify a shoe's originality and translate virtual versions to customers. Nike's works proved that NFTs are not for digital arts only. They can also be used for regular utilities like;\n\nVideo games, 3D images, 2D images, event tickets, blog articles, cards, tokenized assets that aren't virtual like lands, buildings, music.\n\nAlthough there have been serious controversies about the use of NFT due to its high energy burning during blockchain transactions, NFTs are still very much in use today.\n\nThere are several ways you can make money with NFT. Let us start by showing you how to create an NFT.\n\n**How can you create an NFT?**\n\nThe technical word for creating an NFT is \"minting\" it. To create an NFT, you should:\n\nSelect your token standard- you can either use the ERC721, the token standard for the Ethereum blockchain, or ERC1155, the Enjin blockchain. The Enjin blockchain is very complex because of its properties which can allow for the creation of several NFTs. It also works well for the specification of NFTs. There are other blockchains that can be used like;\n\nBinance Smart Chain, Flow by Dapper Labs, Tron, EOS, Polkadot, Tezos, Cosmos, WAX\n\nMake sure you install a browser that uses any of the blockchains you select. Each blockchain has its own NFT standard, wallet service, and marketplace. For example, if you create an NFT with a Tron blockchain. That means you can only sell them on platforms that support Tron. This means you would not be able to sell them on platforms like VIV3, a flow-based marketplace or Open sea, an Ethereum based marketplace.\n\nSince Ethereum is the most used and has the most extensive NFT system, it's advisable to install an Ethereum browser like Trust Wallet, MetaMask, or even Coin base.\n\nBuy Ethereum. Depending on the browser you're using, you can buy Ethereum in several ways. You can purchase using the Luno app. Buy about $50-$100 worth of Ethereum.\n\nConnect your wallet and upload the file you want to turn to an NFT\u2013 there are 3 Ethereum leading marketplace, they are;\n\nOpenSea. - OpenSea is currently the largest Ethereum NFT marketplace, and here's how it works ;\n\n\\- Click on the create button\n\n\\- Connect your Ethereum based wallet\n\n\\- Enter wallet password\n\n\\- On the create button on your right, select \"my collection\".\n\n\\- Add a name and a description of the file you want to upload\n\n\\- Insert an image for your collection\n\n\\- Now click on the \"add new item\" button. You'll reach a window where you can upload.\n\n\\- Upload your image or file.\n\n\\- OpenSea has the option to include special traits in your NFT so include whatever you want to.\n\n\\- Once you're done, click on the \"create\" button at the bottom and sign another message in your wallet to confirm the creation of the NFT. The artwork should appear in your collection when you check.\n\n**What does it cost to create NFTs?**\n\nTo create NFTs on OpenSea, it costs nothing, but on some other Ethereum based marketplace, they charge a fee known as \"gas\" fee. The gas fee is simply the amount in Ethereum you would need to perform certain functions or carry out certain transactions on the blockchain. The gas fee depends on the network and traffic congestion. The more the people transacting at a time, the more the gas fee and vice versa. It's advised to conduct transactions very early during the day or late at night. The gas fee is also considerably low on weekends.\n\n**How To Earn With NFTs**\n\nYou can earn with NFT by either buying or selling NFTs on several marketplaces.\n\nBuying And Selling Of NFTs\n\n***\\* How To Buy***\u2013\n\nThere are certain things that you need to consider before rushing to buy NFT;\n\n\\- The marketplace you intend to buy It from\n\n\\- The wallet you would download to connect with the platform and buy\n\n\\- The cryptocurrency you would use to fund your wallet and buy NFT.\n\n\\- If the NFTs are being sold at a certain time\n\nCertain NFTs are not as available as others. You would have to buy them from specific platforms. You will need to create an account with whichever platform such NFT is and try to determine if it's sold out. NFTs such as these are usually scarce. And are only available for a specific period. The \"pack and art drops\" system is used for really short NFTs, and it helps generate more money. So buyers would fund their account prior to the availability of the product and then try to buy it once it's available. This is because pack and art drops tend to end quickly. And it can be over in less than a minute. There are several NFT marketplaces all over the world. Here are some of them;\n\nOpenSea, Rarible, Nifty Gateway, Axie marketplace, Super rare, VIV3, BakerySwap, Foundation, NFT ShowRoom.\n\n***\\* How To Sell\u2013***\n\nTo sell your NFTs, you have to locate the \"my collections button\", click on it, and then click on \"sell\". When you click on this, you will be taken to a page for pricing where you can determine whether to run an auction or simply just sell at a fixed price.\n\nYou can sell your NFTs for Ethereum or any other cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Although some platforms only support tokens, they are based on. So you can sell for the platform-based token.\n\nRoyalties allow NFT creators to earn a commission, thereby generating a standard income every time the asset is sold to a different person. This has the potential to create passive income streams for artists and other content creators automatically using a smart contract for life.\n\nOn some platforms, there might be a need to pay a certain fee in order for you to list your NFT.\n\n**What are the Problems with NTFs?**\n\nAs with any new technology, NFT has its own downsides and drawbacks. They are:\n\n1. Theft: Due to the lack of restrictions on copyright, there can be a significant theft issue. Artists and sellers can find out that their Art is on a marketplace and sold without their permission or knowledge. In the art world, however, the owners of NFTs (which, in most cases, are digital artists and fine artists) have very little control over how and where their work is sold. The primary value of NFT is that the proof of work makes sure that your original piece has a unique token attached to it, which means that the owner knows that they have the 'original'. But the main problem is that someone can take a JPG and upload it on a different platform and then claim there's no original copy. To avoid theft or being ripped off, artists should dig into platforms that actively promote original work and curate the pieces they sell.\n2. Money flows barriers: it is harder to move money around with NFT.\n3. Environmental Restrictions: operating in the same environment and platform becomes outdated. Artists would need a better way of making sales and getting paid. The whole Ethereum decentralized system works well enough but takes time to be activated. Also, electricity and carbon burned to complete a transaction is really high and might cause environmental health issues.\n\nNFTS has been sold for far costlier prices than other techs. These are the 3 most expensive NFTs ever sold:\n\n\\- February 25, 2021, Trevor Jones sold 4,157 editions of his painting Bitcoin Angel for $777 each over just seven minutes.\n\n\\- Mad Dog Jones topped Beeple's December drop when two open editions NFTs brought in $3.9 million, selling for $2,500 and $5,000 apiece.\n\n\\- Claire \"Grimes\" Boucher entered the NFT arena with splash, dropping \"WarNymph Collection Vol. 1,\". The entire series was sold out within 20 minutes.\n\nLet me know what you guys think?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This article was originally posted here](https://sites.google.com/view/makemoneyonlinegoal/what-are-nfts-and-how-can-you-take-advantage-of-it?authuser=0)",

The hour is upon us. We will be launching the project in 2 hours 30 min!\n\nDxSale link for the presale will be posted here TODAY at 21:00 UTC.\n\nTelegram Chat: MooncoinDeFi\n\n**So what is Mooncoins (MNC)?**\n\n***The world\u2019s first hyperdeflationary savings & payments cryptocurrency...***\n\n**Vision:** A future where a significant percentage of financial transactions flow through Moonwallet and are transacted in terms of Mooncoins!\n\n**Description:** Mooncoin is a deflationary cryptocurrency designed for rapid and sustainable growth. It builds on proven DeFi tokenomics which tax transactions, burn coins and add to locked liquidity. In addition, Mooncoin adds novel tokenomics that rewards its use for savings and payments, giving it fundamental utility and promoting value lock-in for sustainable long-term growth.\n\nMooncoin incentivises hodling and discourage dumping via two two key technologies: Moonwallet \u2014 an investments/savings solution for Mooncoins, and Mooncard \u2014 a low-cost payments system for personal and business users to spend Mooncoin with 0% tax. This promotes sustainable growth in TVL (Total Value Locked) and thus long-term wealth creation for the Mooncoin community.\n\nOnce the project is out and initially funded we\u2019ll go to work on marketing, building out partnerships and pushing Mooncoin out into the financial services world.\n\n**Immediate Next Steps for Mooncoin (MNC):**\n\nTokenomics: Finessed \n\nRebranding: Finalized \n\nTechnology: Tested \n\nWebsite: Out \n\nLight Paper: Out \n\nPresale/PCS Listing: TODAY \n\nFurther Milestones:\n\nCoin Collector - Mooncoin reversible NFTs (min value = cost of minting)\n\nWallet & Payments Card\n\n**Launch Date?** We are pre-launch and our team is working around the clock to bring a high growth utility coin to BSC and expand to the retail masses. We will announce pre-sale, listing dates and other news on our TG and twitter.\n\n**Non Fungible Tokens (NFT) and their utility:**\n\nWe intend to use the community to continually validate both our product roadmap as well share some early designs for the NFTs.\n\nEach NFT will have a certain set value in Mooncoins that are burnt to mint the NFT. The NFTs can be unminted to return Mooncoin but also have a rarity associated with them which the market determine to be more valuable than the raw coins used to mint. For more info check out or TG.\n\n**Wallet & Payments Card:**\n\nThe Mooncoin payments system, via the Wallet and Card, is the primary goal for utility in this project. We are launching in the BSC community and will take advantage of low cost of transactions. We will expand out to Ethereum via a token bridge and sidechain at a later date! We\u2019ll share more on this as we make progress.\n\n**How to find out more and announce?**\n\nOur mods are very responsive so feel free to ask any questions you might have in the TG group.\n\n**As always DYOR!**",

The public testnet is opening this weekend, and from the private testnet 80+ ZTS tokens were deployed. Pretty soon there will be a new wallet update released and new partnerships are going to be regularly announced. Even with price fluctuation I'm comfy as heck with my bag because I know this will blow ETH 2.0 out of the water.  \n\n\nAnyway, share me your bags! What has potential and why are you sold on it?",

In doing so, they have created a new industry, \u201cm$ports\u201d (money   sports). We are thrilled to announce a partnership to integrate their **PRISM** **NFT technology (Protocol Rules for Interoperable Standardized Metadata)**.   Through this partnership, our upcoming NFT series will become fully   interoperable with the AnRKey X gaming ecosystem and allow our community   to participate and benefit from utility rewards, staking APY reward   boosts, and much more.\n\nA month ago Ferrum joined the [DeFi Gaming Coalition](https://medium.com/anrkey-x/defi-gaming-coalition/home)   that AnRKey X launched. We were honored to join the DGC, a network of   industry leaders experienced in Decentralized Finance, Gaming, and   innovative strategies to usher in mass adoption. The concepts behind   Ferrum\u2019s NFT strategy align perfectly with the AnRKey X and we\u2019re   excited to be in great company with innovative projects like AnRKey X\n\nThrough   this partnership, Ferrum\u2019s community can participate in AnRKey X NFT   drops to gain VIP access for new staking pools, earn extra   voting/governance points, and early access to project updates. AnRKey X   is continuously working on more features and tech upgrades so we can   expect more benefits as they are being developed.\n\nNFTs   are growing at an unprecedented rate and helping introduce the masses   to blockchain tech and DeFi. This is the mass adoption opportunity  we\u2019ve  been waiting for to help the space grow sustainably. This is a  great  opportunity to engage, educate and retain existing and new  communities  to our ecosystem. We look forward to mutual growth  alongside AnRKey X  with NFTs and more integration within DeFi Gaming.\n\n[Source](https://medium.com/ferrumnetwork/ferrum-network-and-anrkey-x-enter-into-a-partnership-7862ef5493b1)",

We've developed an entire ecosystem of fantasy sports ownership and growing to encompass international events of every sport in each level of play, not just pros!  Grow and manage your sports franchise or simply participate in player scouting and fan games. We wish to invite you to grow the league from anywhere in the world and represent your sport with a truly unique cryptocurrency asset driven platform.\n\nMost fantasy sports platforms simply track your players to help you understand how many points your lineup was awarded based on the performance of the players on the field. But UFF Sports provides you the ability to be more than a general manager by providing digital asset ownersip of players, franchises, and draft rights. You own the players, as digital assets (NFT's), and rights to trade them.  Fans and scouts can register up and coming players, or franchise owners can battle for superior players in our dynasty mirroring fantasy drafts.\n\nTypical fantasy sports leagues compete against thousands of other teams. Instead, UFF Sports has built a completely new game model where only an elite few will have rights to compete as franchises in their respective sports",

Everyone will be able to sell their NFTs on marketplace of VANCAT Token. VanCatToken allows users to easily deposit BEP-20 tokens (ANY tokens) into an NFT. A scarce NFT (e.g. Art, Collectible, Virtual Real Estate, In-Game Item, etc.) can now be transformed into a basket holding a number of other tokens. VanCatToken platform is a new protocol layer, enabling a new world of NFTs. For our public launch, we\u2019ll also be releasing the first decentralized application (DApp) on top of the VanCatToken Protocol, focused on Art/Collectible NFTs.\n\nInitial DApp is developed to be used with the growing crypto art market, with plans to rapidly expand with additional DApps covering more of the NFT space in the coming quarters.\n\n**Why CryptoArt?** Well, CryptoArt is huge right now (and likely will get a LOT bigger), and we want to give Artists a tool to do more (dare we say, make more \u201cinterest-ing\u201d) with their Crypto Art.\n\nDApp allows users to Mint / Create an NFT and then deposit the asset of their choice into this and create their own NFTs. In our v1 web application, we\u2019re only supporting NFTs that are created using the VanCat NFT Minting Station. We\u2019re doing this to ensure safety for users on the platform. Users can mint their own NFTs or choose to purchase others created by VanCat Token platform users. If you\u2019re interested in being one of the artists featured in the launch, please let us know in telegram!\n\n\\-In Q3 , $VANCAT aims to launch a IOS game which users can earn tokens while playing game.\n\n\\-In Q4 or earlier, $VANCAT is targeting to launch a NFT LAUNCHPAD for NFT projects.\n\n\\-There will be a auction every week for famous artist\u2019s NFTs.

            "text": "Non-Fungible Tokens which are popularly called NFTs are becoming the new gem in the digital assets industry, as it is one of the most sought after assets in the industry today. \n\n These NFTs which are often developed as ERC-721 standard tokens are considered to be unique and so are not mutually interchangeable like other regular cryptocurrencies in the industry.\n\n This means that these NFTs are not divisible in any way, considering the fact that they have identifying information stored on their smart contract, hence, the inability to be replaced by another token. \n\n Non-Fungible Tokens are often linked to digital assets as they are even used to prove the ownership of digital assets. \n\n But being deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain as an ERC-721 token has in a way become the limitation of the Non-Fungible Tokens, seeing as it is making this digital asset class seem inefficient, probably because of the surge in the gas fee of the Ethereum network. \n\n **INTRODUCING YOU TO THE MATIC LAYER 2 NETWORK AND ITS BENEFITS**\n\n Matic Network is a reliable system which has been developed to provide a solution to the inefficiencies of the Ethereum Blockchain simply by making available the scalability which is currently lacking on the Ethereum network. \n\n By doing this, Matic Network facilitates speedy financial transactions, with guaranteed transaction finality, all at a reduced cost, through its use of improved technologies. \n\nIt does this with an improved version of the Plasma combined with its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) side chains, to make transactions cheaper and faster, as well as the capability of processing multiple transactions at a time, with ease. \n\n**NFTs DEPLOY ON THE MATIC NETWORK**\n\n Since the problem of high gas fee faced by users on the Ethereum network has made it increasingly difficult for different systems to develop and launch their NFTs on the network, as it will not only be expensive to its users, but slow due to the congestion of the network, thereby making NFT transactions to be unproductive. \n\n So, the need for a reliable Layer-2 network on which NFTs can be deployed increased greatly and a close look at the Matic Network shows that it is the perfect system for the job. \n\n Due to the massive scale brought to the Ethereum Blockchain by the Matic Network, it definitely has everything needed for the efficient performance of NFTs on its system, that's why different NFTs have resolved to deploy on the Matic Network. \n\n This Layer-2 network (Matic), now gives the users of NFTs which has deployed on its system the ability to send out and receive ERC-721 NFTs with ease, at a very low cost and an increased speed, making it very profitable for its users. \n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\n Matic Layer-2 network is one of the very best systems for the deployment and efficient functioning of NFTs, considering that it has all it takes to facilitate NFT transactions at affordable rates, in turn giving great value to the users. \n\n NFTs are no longer subjected to the limitations posed by the Ethereum network, as Matic has solved these problems through its improvement of Ethereum and also supports the deployment of NFTs for the benefit of the global users. \n \n[Source ](https://www.publish0x.com/tochi-blog/matic-network-and-nfts-xnqnrrw)",

            "text": " \n\n\ud83d\ude80   First I will post a quick rundown of what R34P is and then I will  write  about the Farm/NFT shop we are about to launch and how they  interact  with each other \ud83d\ude80\n\nR34P   is the first and only legitimate deflationary token which sends rewards   in the form of tokens and ETH directly to holders and liquidity   providers \ud83d\udc02\n\nTOKENOMICS\u2699\ufe0f\n\n\\-    R34P (R34P) token benefits every holder with a low-cost charge of 1%    fee in every transaction on the blockchain, redistributes to every    wallet holder automatically based on the amount of R34P token in their    wallets and another 1% will be sent to 0x000 wallet that will    automatically burn and reduce the circulation/ total supply.\n\n\\-R34P    sends rewards directly to liquidity providers and holders with out  the   need to claim allowing the holder to constantly increase the % of  the   total supply they hold which in turn makes their rewards bigger,  at the   same time the total supply/circulating supply is being burned,   creating a  compounding effect which results in an exponential growth   curve.\n\nTHE FARM \u2699\ufe0f\n\nWe   have decided to create a farm in order to promote the health and price   appreciation of R34P.  The deflationary reward token you earn from   staking lp tokens in the farm contacts is called GR1M.   Pairs available   for staking are R34P-ETH lp token,  GR1M-ETH lp token, and GR1M-R34P  lp  token.  The rate of return you achieve from these farms as well as  the  burn rate of GR1M is dependent on how many R34P and GR1M you hold  in  your wallet,  how early you got into the pool, how long you have  been in  the pool, and which exclusive NFTs you hold!!\n\nNFT INTEGRATION  \u2699\ufe0f\n\nThe   exclusive NFTs available in our shop and as rewards for interacting   with the farming and game contracts are original pieces of art created   by professional artists that are extremely limited and only available   through swapping GR1M for them in the NFT Bazaar or interacting with our   contracts. The beauty and originality of the art alone makes these  NFTs  worth collecting and trading, but people who know R34P know we  don't do  anything unless it's ground breaking and we are going above  and beyond  all expectations.\n\nOn   top of the artistic, collectable and investment value of our NFTs you   also unlock special abilities allowing you to interact with and benefit   from the farm and GR1M contracts in different ways by holding specific   exclusive NFTs.   For example holding  a rare NFT from our shop may   reduce the burn rate of your GR1M token from 3% to 1% allowing you to   collect more rewards!!  While another NFT could send your % of the GR1M   tokens which would other wise go to a burn address, into the liquidity   pool to be locked allowing you to continue to reap rewards from farming   it instead of those tokens getting destroyed through a burn address.   In  this way we are adding more gamification to the system, as wall as   giving secondary and third use cases for our tokens/NFTs!!\n\nA NEW MODEL OF GOVERNANCE \u2699\ufe0f\n\nEvery   individual will be able to use the NFTs they purchase to get the   maximum value out of our contracts given their investment strategy.    When enough individuals are acting on these contracts using the NFTs to   reach their farming goals it essentially becomes a governance model   where the whole ecosystem and be bent and shaped to the will of the   stakers and NFT holders!  It's really an exciting opportunity to be a   part of  \ud83e\udd73\n\nIN CONCLUSION \u2699\ufe0f\n\nThere   is so much more I need to cover about the tokenomics of the farm &   GR1M, the details of how all the different NFTs can be used,  the  launch  process, and further development which include a casino which  has  already been built but I wanted this to be an introductory post  about  what we are launching in the next couple days!  In a follow up  post I  will go into greater detail about everything!!\n\nNOW   IS THE TIME TO GET INTO R34P!!  The 48 hour countdown and the link to   the farm will be made public tomorrow.  When this is done a massive   promotional push will be made including youtube interviews, AMAs with   large promotional/research groups,  calls made by the largest influences   in the space, and posts/targeted ads going up on every major social   media platform.

            "text": "You know Monero, Zcash, Dash are all billion dollar companies and rightly so. I mean what\u2019s more important than privacy and ultimately security? The use case for these coins was doubted in the beginning but they have time after time proven the critics wrong. \n\nPrivacy is here now guys and will be here to stay. NFT\u2019s, Cookiedoughswapfarm and other similar kitchen based projects may well grow but I am definitely more certain that privacy is the biggest sector for growth in the medium to long term in the cryptosphere. \n\nSomething that needs addressed is private coins are essentially non-existent on decentralised exchanges - reason being that they are largely written on a different codebase making it impossible to work with on standard ERC-20 exchanges. You can acquire these coins through places like Binance and Kraken but they are as centralised as they come so it almost defeats the purpose?? Also imagine if a Government of power (\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8) decides to outlaw privacy coins.... who thinks that Binance and Kraken are going to defy them and continue to trade?? Not me... \n\nWE NEED A TRULY UNTRACEABLE DECENTRALISED EXCHANGE!! \n\nI\u2019ve been researching this area because I\u2019m super bullish on it and it\u2019s a gaping wide goal ready to be scored by an ambitious, forward-thinking and risk taking project. To be honest it\u2019s such a void space in crypto and I\u2019ve really only found one team with the minerals to get it done (and it\u2019s a big if - but what new crypto project isn\u2019t?) \n\nPoltergeist Exchange (which in Beta looks super slick) is potentially the answer. They are pioneering the tech and in a super early Beta phase that it\u2019s hard to tell what will happen. Either way it\u2019s f*cking exciting! They launched about a month ago and have ambitions to create the golden bullet solution of an untraceable Dex that will enable trade of Monero amongst other privacy coins totally anonymously. \n\nSo the Poltergeist team is headed up by Josh Case who is the founder and an accomplished Dev. He is backed up by Mate Tokay who is the co-founder of bitcoin.com. They are also backed up but also in a very distanced way by the notorious John McAfee who for all his critics did run a very successful multi million $ enterprise spanning decades. \n\nThe tokenomics are interesting. 46M $GHOUL (Poltergeist native coin) in circulation and only a market cap of ~$8M. The burn address has also removed 39% of the supply. \n\nAnother point of note is that 100% of ALL trading fees go to holders of Ghoul coin. And if you\u2019re a holder you have reduced trading fees as low as 0.015%. I\u2019m still to find another exchange that offers this.\n\nThe roadmap is exciting with airdrops, private chat release and Dex launch with Main Net towards end of 2021. \n\nPeople I have spoken to have such mixed reviews about this project (different opinions are what makes the \ud83c\udf0e turn) - whether it be due to the fact it\u2019s so new which is either too risky or worth the risk due to the potential rewards or John McAfee is either too controversial or a PR god. \n\nPersonally I am interested in the tech and the use case. That\u2019s the logic I have used to buy every single coin I have ever bought. I might be wrong with this one but by removing emotion and applying logic to the crypto space and where future demand may well lie, I feel this is worth a small proportion of my $. \n\nPlease comment, tell me how wrong or right I am. I\u2019m thick skinned so don\u2019t hold back \ud83d\ude05 \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWebsite: https://poltergeistexchange.com/ \n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PoltergeistDEX\n\nMedium: https://poltergeistexchange.medium.com/",

(OTCQB: BTCS) (\u201cBTCS\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a  digital asset  and blockchain technology focused company, announced  today the  appointment of a new independent director, Carol Van Cleef,  to its Board  of Directors.\n\n\u201cWe  are extremely pleased to  welcome Carol to our board,\u201d stated Charles  Allen, Chief Executive  Officer of BTCS. \u201cShe has already provided  invaluable support as an  advisor to BTCS in our early years in 2014 and  2015. In addition to the  vast wealth of experience and wisdom she  brings as an industry expert,  Carol\u2019s appointment as our second  independent director will help us  further strengthen our corporate  governance, a key element in our  planned uplisting to a senior  exchange.\u201d\n\nAn  internationally  recognized authority on and pioneer in legal issues  involving  cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, Ms. Van Cleef is  Chair of  the Blockchain and Digital Assets practice at Bradley Arant  Boult  Cummings LLP. With a focus on regulatory, compliance, and  enforcement  matters, Ms. Van Cleef has built a global reputation as a  leading  attorney, counsellor and problem solver working extensively  across the  financial services industry and throughout the cryptocurrency  and  blockchain communities. She represents virtual currency exchanges,   blockchain developers, NFT creators and platforms, and various types of   financial services and fintech companies.\n\nIn   addition to her legal practice, Ms. Van Cleef serves as CEO of  Luminous  Group, a blockchain technology, growth advisory and risk  management  solutions company that also develops and delivers anti-money  laundering  and sanctions compliance training through the AML Training  Institute.  She also serves as an advisor to a number of early-stage  companies in  fintech and blockchain-related technologies.\n\n\u201cI   am excited to join the BTCS board,\u201d commented Ms. Van Cleef. \u201cI  believe  my background and legal experience will be an asset to BTCS as  it  continues to grow its operations. BTCS was the first U.S. public  company  to mine bitcoin in 2014 and the first to launch a digital asset   treasury strategy in 2017. I look forward to working closely with   management as they continue to execute on their vision for long-term   success.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe plan to appoint a  third  independent director shortly,\u201d continued Allen. \u201cA third  independent  director would make the majority of our board independent, a  key  requirement to list on a national securities exchange such as  Nasdaq.\u201d\n\n[Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/01/2203275/0/en/BTCS-Welcomes-New-Independent-Director-to-Strengthen-Corporate-Governance-in-Preparation-for-Planned-Uplist-to-Senior-Exchange.html)",

The former Federal Reserve chair presents to a college class when a student played by Pete Davidson asks her what an NFT is.\n\nNFTs have captured the spotlight in recent months with eye-catching sales. In the past month alone, crypto art sales have brought in over $1 billion, according to NFT marketplace\u00a0CryptoSlam.\n\nEarlier in March, digital artist\u00a0Beeple made history when he sold a crypto art piece for $69.3 million. Other high-profile figures including\u00a0Grimes, Steve Aoki, and\u00a0Jack Dorsey have also sold NFTs for millions of dollars.\n\nNFTs operate as unique digital assets that can be bought online using cryptocurrencies, including ether and WAX. The tokens can include anything from art to sports highlights, cat videos, memes, and even individual tweets.\n\nWhen you buy an NFT in most cases you\u2019re not buying content,\u00a0but rather a token that connects your name with the creator\u2019s art on the blockchain. If someone buys an image or meme, they can own it on the blockchain, but they have no control over rights to its distribution.\n\nLearn more about the SNL skit here: [https://marketbuzz.ca/saturday-night-live-nft-parody/](https://marketbuzz.ca/saturday-night-live-nft-parody/?fbclid=IwAR19HebwYCBzHc0NY9NGkIZJHQYhLVsF5jTI5uUGaocLvrFIgQpAQ4_Wb0k)",

The auction market provides an eBay-like platform where you can create and post auctions anytime for anyone to participate in. The Bounce auction market is where supply and demand for scarce assets (such as tokens and NFT\u2019s) meet each other, and reach mass audiences.\n\nNow, we are on the road to the second milestone.\n\n## Introducing Bounce Store\n\nIn addition to a free and decentralized auction market, we have noticed a growing demand for a designated auction space dedicated to individuals or institutions.\n\nWe are excited to introduce Bounce store, where you can build your own decentralized auction space and showcase your products, cryptocurrency assets, digital art or any kind of non-fungible token, to a broad audience.\n\nUsers can increase the quality, user experience and visibility of their range of assets by configuring various types of auctions to be traded in their own space. For example, digital artists can have their own space where only their own art is showcased and auctioned off.\n\n \n\n**Launching Bounce Stores in two phases**\n\nPhase one: Bounce stores are launched and will be operated in a centralized way. The Bounce team will team up with relevant blockchain builders to create their designated stores. The purpose of this first phase is to gain a better understanding of the users needs and optimizing the general user experience.\n\nPhase two: In this phase anyone can create their own Bounce Store and configure their own auction environment.\n\nLet\u2019s [Bounce](https://bounce.finance/) in Bounce Stores!",
