Saylor on the other hand is going to get smoked if we continually trade under 30k and especially under 20 if he's even in the game at that point. I mean a median drawdown post cycle would put us 9 to 12 k. If we draw down less than usual and just test the 200 week that's what 20K?

In fact if Bitcoin doesn't crash this time you're going to have a hell of a lot less interest on the next halving. One of the reasons people get into crypto is because of the potential run. If that's set up isn't fair and we get stuck in some sideways range like forever 6k. You just watch the interest dwindle. Saylor needs to blow up some poor idiot needs to blow his head off from losing everything. Even more people need to become homeless and lose it all. Then we set up for the next cycle.

I've seen so many stocks squeeze I don't know what to think, while a lot of companies that are supposed to be dead, come alive, or companies like evergrand that for some reason never really died, even though it's dead in theory. In practice, Evergrand, the company that every time I read about it, seem to have lost another billion or two, just never seem to die. Someone doing an accurate shorting on that company (which I never thought to do, stupid me.) would probably think it should be fully declared bankrupt and not be purchaseable anymore, which it is in IBKR I think at least.\n\nInflation is sort of the same beast, it's an exponential effect through time, with a slow start. I've been invested in crypto for a long time, on and off although, but I had to sell most of my assets last year, because I had no money to buy food or pay rent, even though I bought the cordano a year before as a hedge against inflation. My belief is still this; we are paid shit, most of us, everything increased in costs, but most of us have gotten less hours (I left my job in hopes of a more stable one, although I didn't get any new job, and now I'm living on my savings.)\n\nThe people so far that benefitted from higher prices, they invested in stocks, especially when it has been a bull market and they feel safer with stocks than tokens, we will see a stable rise in crypto when more and more newspapers report on \"higher than before reported inflation\" and people begin to feel that these currencies actually work. So far, bitcoin is too clunky, etheruem too expensive, and cardano is not developed enough to offer anything as of right now. \n\nRemember; crypto is the LAST place people will put their savings in, when everything else fails, so first, everything else sort of needs to fail. That takes some time, like they say, \"Rome wasn't built on one day.\"\n\nIf you believe in crypto, think instead that NOW is the time to invest, it's almost a godgiven time, if an asset is cheaper now than when you first bought it, revise and see if the fundamentals actually changed, or if you just got granted another investing opportunity. For example, my cordano halved in value after I sold them, which made me a bit more happy now, because when I get my check soon, I can buy way more for way less. I still believe in Cordano, even though the market believes otherwise.",

People in crypto subs seem to want to demonize regulation and point to the banking sector as why regulation did nothing to help consumers during the financial crisis of 2008. If you actually looked closely at countries around the world, the ones with the tightest regulations on banks survived the 2008 times much better without any bailouts then the countries that don't regulate banks properly. The US and Canada are perfect examples of both sides of that, in the US the banks needed a bailout because the regulations in place let bankers make shady deals and give mortgages to people that couldn't actually qualify, but in Canada where there is much tighter regulations on the banking sector, the major banks didn't need any kind of aid package, since it was against the regulations to do those shady deals.\n\nTDLR: Regulation for the sake of control is bad, regulation to protect consumers from scams, rug pulls and honey pots is good.",

A sidechain is basically another instance of the chain with small changes in the parameters, like for example polygon has sacrificed decentralization to be able to process more transactions and it is using PoS instead of PoW.\n\nLayer 2 solutions on Ethereum as shown on L2beat.com are basically compression mechanisms for Ethereum which allows for much higher throughput. We are currently seeing massive innovation in both layer 2 solutions becoming better at compression and Ethereum as the layer 1 becoming better at supporting layer 2 solutions, this will lead to exponential scaling since if you get 2x improvement from the layer 2 and then also get a 2x improvement from Ethereum you total 4x improvement instead of just 2x if you didn't have the layer 2. Luckily we aren't just seeing 2x improvements but 10-100x on both layer 1 Ethereum layer 2s over the next couple of years. This is progressive prosess and currently scaling is outpacing demand.\n\nL2fees.info let's you see the tx cost on the different layer 2 solutions",

He thinks there is a possibility that governments could use the nascent technology to crackdown on dissent.\u00a0\n\n>\u201cIf Mark Zuckerberg shouldn\u2019t have the power to make epoch-changing decisions or control users\u2019 data for profit, Buterin believes, then neither should he send some people to other blockchains, or allow others to use his platform [Ethereum] in unsavory ways,\u201d\u00a0excerpts of the interview read.\n\nSeems like there's a major typo in here, especially in the second paragraph. That take appears to be literally opposite what Buterin stands for.\n\n\n>Times Writes:\n\n>\u201cTo Buterin, the worst-case scenario for the future of crypto is that blockchain technology ends up concentrated in the hands of dictatorial governments. He is unhappy with El Salvador\u2019s rollout of Bitcoin as legal tender, which has been riddled with identity theft and volatility. The prospect of governments using the technology to crack down on dissent is why Buterin is adamant about remaining decentralized crypto. He sees the technology as the most powerful equalizer to surveillance technology deployed by governments (like China\u2019s) and powerful companies (like Meta) alike.\u201d\n\nThis contradicts the previous excerpt. Who TF writes this poorly edited crap? Or us this some kind of deliberate attempt to confuse and scatter??

Every investment company, like Blackrock for instance, is audited daily at market close to make sure they are within investment percentages written into their mandate. It ensures portfolio diversity. For a newer asset class, first the compliance team has to be convinced that it will pass audit. Infrastructure in the form of audit programs had to be created for cryptocurrencies because the previously didn\u2019t exist.\n\nThis is like a double win. A major auditing firm has added bitcoin to its treasury. This paves the way for institutional adoption!! These companies manage trillions of dollars each. Imagine them taking a 5% allocation. Just the top ten investment firms by assets under management (AUM) alone manage $33 trillion dollars. A 5 percent stake of ONLY these is $1.65 trillion. Its a bigger deal than has caught on yet. There are hundreds of large investment houses, and thousands of smaller ones.",

And that's not including wasted formatting space, so probably 24 drives a year.\n\nNo, this is not realistic or scalable for \"users\" outside of IT home labs and data centers... sounds like centralization... hmm",

This means that they have to spend, just to play keep up. Polygon is now the inferior Layer 2, in fact they had to spend over a Billion just to get their Tech caught up (Mir & Hermez acquisitions), and MATIC gas fees are still more expensive than LoopRing (LRC).\n\nWhen a company has an Endless Marketing Budget, it also screams over valued. They are having to Pay money, to Pump their value. If they stop Pumping their value, people lose interest and will divest into other projects with more potential. \n\nUnfortunately this reminds me a lot of the ADA run up that went down this year. BILLIONS were pumped into ADA for marketing and partnerships to hit the $3 ATH. Then what happened? Massive Rug Pull. As soon as the DAPP capability was launched, and there was no new catalyst to market, Investors mostly sold off. I\u2019m worried the same fate might happen with MATIC.",

That period was absolutely critical for Litecoin gaining traction.\n\nCrypto for retail transactions is a solution in search of a problem, anyway.\n\nBTW, Litecoin wouldn\u2019t be as \u201clow fee\u201d if it were heavily used, and it is slow in its current incarnation. Maybe there will be a future where the LN tide lifts both BTC and LTC, but I can just as easily see LTC being a little used relic even in that scenario.",

I just wish it was easier to transfer between my bank. Pretty decent list of coins and you can lock them away to collect earn and prevent panic selling.\n\nThe crypto earn doesn\u2019t compound, interest goes into your trading account and is too small an amount to stake on its own, so it sits idle until it\u2019s time to restake.\n\nI\u2019ve also used Coinbase, Gemini, and BlockFi (which is for holding not trading).\n\nCoinbase and Gemini both eat away at profits with fees. \n\nCoinbase Pro should solve that issue, but I haven\u2019t used it yet. It cuts fees dramatically and works more like a stock exchange with the ability to set orders for specific prices. \n\n(EDIT: u/BeneficialFly5857 pointed out that Gemini Active Trader doesn\u2019t have those fees, but it is browser based.)\n\nIf I were to try day trading crypto that\u2019s *probably* where I\u2019d do it? That or just use a stock broker. They mostly work in IOUs but if you\u2019re day trading that seems fine.\n\nGemini is the Winkelvoss exchange so if name recognition is a thing there\u2019s that. They can take a while pulling your crypto from Earn to your Trading account -  sometimes days - but it\u2019s not totally locked like Crypto.com. Earn pays out and compounds daily.\n\nBlockFi is great for a crypto savings account. I have some in stablecoins collecting 8-10%. You aren\u2019t locked at all, but they pay out monthly.\n\nI\u2019ve tried and been unable to verify myself on Celsius and Binance, although the latter eventually worked but by then I saw no reason to actually use it. \n\nThe Celsius app doesn\u2019t have a button to take the photo of my license for some reason and I am so confused. There\u2019s one on the \u201cnational ID\u201d page\u2026 probably me doing something wrong with an ad blocker or VPN?\n\nI have also used the Crypto.com and Coinbase debit cards. The red crypto card gets you \u201cfree\u201d Spotify and the $400 worth of CRO I had to stake went up nicely to $700 but that\u2019s obviously not guaranteed. \n\nIt\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d because they reimburse you an equivalent amount of CRO, and then you have to top up your debit card.\n\nCoinbase makes it real easy to just buy USDC funded straight from your bank and you don\u2019t have to top up the card. I bought tacos the other day with it and it was pretty neat.\n\nBlockFi has a Visa credit card that gives Bitcoin with use and increases the interest return on your coins.. I haven\u2019t tried it.",

A currency is also influenced by network effects but it is weaker due the fewer use cases. However, you shouldn't forget that the market value is also based on speculation and hype. So, a currency that might be better from a technical and utility standpoint could potentially give back lower returns than another one. In my opinion, platform-based cryptocurrencies will outcompete traditional ones like Bitcoin when the adoption by the economy and the population really begins.",

While scams and rug pulls exist in crypto, people scream \"fraud!\" and \"rugpull!\" as soon as a coin starts under preforming. Mostly inexperienced investors. It's annoying. it's like people want to blame something other than themselves for picking a failing project. I've made bad picks, but I don't pick rug pulls. Maybe I'm just lucky.\n\nThe problem I think, is people not being able to spot the tell tale signs of a scam, or how to spot honest projects. People either have that sense, or don't. I've always had a keen sense for spotting bullshit, and fraudulent coins stand out to me quite easily.  I've never got rugged or scammed and I've been in and out of probably 100s of coins. But yes the insurance is a nice option, but again i think that's more for if the coin fails, not \"here's insurance in case we rug pull you\" lol. Or who knows, maybe that's a scam. How did your process of picking this coin differ from all the times you seem to have been scammed?",

That means there is no chance I can send money home besides via Western Union which have around 10% tax. I cannot also deposit cash to my bank account even if I present my ID and bank account number. My only chance is by Revolut but I still need someone to pay me in revolut, then I can send some money to my account. If it's a working day the money probably will be there by the end of the day, if it's not they will arrive in the first working day. The whole banking system is too slow and out dated to put it in a light words. I hope that someday there will be widespread crypto terminals where I can convert fiat to crypto, but who knows when this will be available...",

People in crypto subs seem to want to demonize regulation and point to the banking sector as why regulation did nothing to help consumers during the financial crisis of 2008. If you actually looked closely at countries around the world, the ones with the tightest regulations on banks survived the 2008 times much better without any bailouts then the countries that don't regulate banks properly. The US and Canada are perfect examples of both sides of that, in the US the banks needed a bailout because the regulations in place let bankers make shady deals and give mortgages to people that couldn't actually qualify, but in Canada where there is much tighter regulations on the banking sector, the major banks didn't need any kind of aid package, since it was against the regulations to do those shady deals.\n\nTDLR: Regulation for the sake of control is bad, regulation to protect consumers from scams, rug pulls and honey pots is good.",

Much easier this way than to produce anything of actual value.\nEventually, the coins with actual use cases will get more and more adopted and the useless coins will fall into obscurity, the volatility will settle down, and the get rich quick crowd will look elsewhere. It will take some time though. But that's why big players like BTC call every coin a $h1tcoin because if more new people don't put their money into BTC, the hodlers won't get the big pay day they're looking for. The entire space is just the greater fool theory personified.\nSure you can get rich betting on some random coin and hope you get lucky, but I personally stick to projects with actual real world value and daily use case other than trading and speculation. Hopefully this nonsense will all be a thing of the past in 5 years.\n\nGood post, op.\nu/chaintip",

Me driving my car, in fact the entire total of all the cars driving around in the world, is a drop in the bucket compared to the CO2 and waste produced by the MANUFACTURING of cars, and manufacturing plants in general. So me running one computer with a couple of GPUs is like nothing, it uses barely any more power than just running a normal computer all day.\n\nAre you a monster for enabling the industry by participating in it with trading? How is that any different from buying a car, or eating meat, or buying/using any product that was built in a factory? This doesn't make any of these things okay, but where do we draw the line? \n\nCrypto only seems to stand out because it doesn't generate anything of intrinsic physical value, but in my mind neither does the minting of physical money, which like crypto has value for its function in mediating a global trade system.\n\nThe problem here is that we've arrived at a \"well you're just as bad!\" argument which doesn't accomplish anything, and if you are invested in the future of crypto you actually SHOULD be critical of its environmental impact in order to force innovation. The system we have is far from perfect but that doesn't mean we should destroy it entirely, the core idea of crypto currency is a very good one it just needs (a lot of) work on the execution.",

It was always a bit of a dull roar in the background, but now it seems like \"cryptocurrency\" has become synonymous with \"scam\" in the popular view. There's thread after thread of people raging about companies trying to make use of blockchains in various ways, and whenever I try to simply inject a little technical information (not even promoting anything in specific, just explaining \"this is how such-and-such works\") I get downvoted and excoriated as a scammer or a \"cryptobro.\"\n\nPeople enjoy righteous indignation. They love being part of a mob that's persecuting a deserving target. There's camaraderie, they're fighting the good fight, they're *heroes*. So if you try to point out \"hey, maybe you're wrong about some particular detail of what's justifying your rage\" you become the enemy. You're threatening to harshen their buzz.\n\nI mainly reassure myself by observing that this is a common, repeating pattern in human nature. Eventually the endorphins from repeated NFT-bashing will become stale. Eventually Ethereum will switch fully to PoS and the environmental boogeyman will lose his hold (sorry, Bitcoin). It's going to cost a lot of opportunities along the way, but if a blockchain application is truly advantageous then eventually someone will take advantage of it. I just found out that in November cryptocurrencies accounted for 3.7% of global equity, I really don't see the technology going away as a result of some ignorant anger on internet fora.",

It's the same effect that e-commerce had on commerce.\n\nBank lending discrimination could be solved too as a smart contract can be used to look at financial history aka numbers only rather than zipcodes, race, martial status, etc.\n\nAnd the myth that crypto helps criminals in any way, which it doesn't since your transactions are public & verifiable.

The market then rallied around this huge get-rich-quick mentality and now it's full of staking, holding, new coins which are just rug pulls, pre-mines, crazy scams and shady promotions. The original idea of decentralized peer to peer cash is mostly lost. The problem is that first world countries are first to learn about this tech, but remittances to and payments within money-insecure countries are where it's actually most useful. There are still some smaller communities focused on the original intention and the hope for what Decentralized finance can bring to the world, but most people here are speculators hoping to make more fiat and it casts the whole thing in a terrible light. NFTs are really interesting and have some cool use cases but the NFT market today is just get rich quick.

The only wallets in crypto that cost money are hardware wallets and they are the safest, so once you build up a stack, you should look into getting one.\n\nSome things to be aware of, each wallet will have a seed phrase or private key. NEVER give that out under any circumstances, if you do, your entire wallet will be emptied. Write the seed phrase on paper and store that in a very safe place. Write it on multiple pieces of paper and store them in separate, secure places if you can. Lastly, never store it electronically, not even a screen shot of it.\n\nIf you find cons in your wallet, that you didn't purchase, don't touch them, they are scam coins designed to entice you to try and swap them. If you do, they will compromise your wallet.\n\nIf you have to use your parent to on ramp fiat or off ramp fiat, make sure you pay for the taxes your gains will incur. The tax people in what ever country you reside in will know that a crypto transaction took place and will want your parents to pay any taxes that your trading or farming have incurred, make sure to budget for that so your parents aren't getting a nasty surprise at the end of the year.\n\nGood luck on your crypto journey and stay safe out there.",

This is life. This is how shit happens.\n\nTruth is, we don't really have anybody or anything to blame. From the time we arrive on planet Earth, till now, we've been making various decisions about things. (also taking actions or not taking actions) These decisions have led us to this exact spot. We have nothing to blame but our previous decisions (and actions/inactions).  If you want to blame something, I guess the blame could be placed on the lottery of parenting.\n\nWe randomly get a set a parents or caretakers (at least it would seem to be random). These parents have a certain way of thinking. There's good aspects to their thinking, and bad aspects. As a child, you're going to naturally end up with some combination of your parents or caretaker's thinking patterns. You'll benefit from some of these patterns, but you'll also suffer. It seems to be a bit of a lottery, so I suppose if somebody wanted to curse and blame something for their misfortune, that's where the blame goes. Because it's really your only legit excuse. \n\nWe get whatever good or bad thinking that we get from our custodians, and then we start making our own decisions about things, and it's these decisions and actions or inactions that really matter.\n\nYou've got to pull yourself up from your bootstraps and take charge of every aspect of your life, and learn the wisdom to understand what shit is out of your control. Keep working the job that you hate, but if you're not going to do anything constructive about this problem, then please stop complaining. What you'll likely need to do is learn some sort of marketable skill, in some subject area that interests you, but also has a pent up demand for those services. You're going to have to sacrifice huge chunks of your free time to learn this new marketable skill. Once you've acquired this marketable skill, then you can start looking for a job in that field, all the while still maintaining your shitty soul-crushing job in the meantime.\n\nEverything has a price. Pay the price or STFU",

I end up not using that \u20ac12.00 but the pound has now appreciated in value relative to the euro. Therefore when I change my \u20ac12.00 back into pounds I only get \u00a39.50. This would mean I lose 50p. Repeat the story but this time when I turn my euros back into pounds the pound has depreciated so I get \u00a310.50 from my \u20ac12.00. I\u2019ve now made a profit of 50p. Replace pound with your currency of choice and euro with your crypto currency of choice and it works in exactly the same way. (This is all of course minus exchange fees)",

By adding Metadata to transactions you can automate all kinds of transactions, the metadata will contain the public key of the recipient of the transaction, proving that that transaction took place in a particular block in the chain.\n\nthe benefits of this is you can prove ownership of something without a need for having much identifying personal information required from a practical or technical standpoint.\n\nas an example, event tickets could be sold as NFTs, owning the NFT ticket proves your ticket is real, your signature proves you are the owner. this would make scalping fake tickets impossible, it would also allow the reselling of tickets in online marketplaces very convenient, the issuer could even include a clause where each time a ticket is resold they collect a fee. this would reduce demand of customers who are buying tickets to speculate on them.\n\nvehicle titles. we could completely cut auto dealers out of the picture for buying and selling vehicles. ownership of vehicals could be verified on a blockchain. leases and auto loans could be completely transparent. we could have standardized terms that are chosen by market demand where anyone could list or purchase from anyone, anyone could provide liquidity for the loans and earn profits from them.\n\npretty much any their party dealer for anything we commonly use some service to find the best deals on anything, vacations, air travel, cars, deeds, leases can use a combination of smart contracts and NFTs that represent actual property could possibly become a peer to peer market that would allow both parties to get the most competitive terms by cutting out brokers, and anyone could benefit from it from any angle.\n\nemails can do this because while emails create records the servers they are on must be maintained and the information on them is not probably assured to be maintained permanently, and the information can be interacted with easily as emails are private and not instantly verifiable. \n\nthink of everything the internet has brought us, not think how crypto has the potential to remake all of it in a way that eliminates a need for a third party to facilitate verifying your personal information, storing your data and sharing that information only in approved ways.",

He is unhappy with El Salvador\u2019s rollout of Bitcoin as legal tender, which has been riddled with identity theft and volatility. The prospect of governments using the technology to crack down on dissent is why Buterin is adamant about remaining decentralized crypto. He sees the technology as the most powerful equalizer to surveillance technology deployed by governments (like China\u2019s) and powerful companies (like Meta) alike.\u201d\n\nThis contradicts the previous excerpt.

While scams and rug pulls exist in crypto, people scream \"fraud!\" and \"rugpull!\" as soon as a coin starts under preforming. Mostly inexperienced investors. It's annoying. it's like people want to blame something other than themselves for picking a failing project. I've made bad picks, but I don't pick rug pulls. Maybe I'm just lucky.\n\nThe problem I think, is people not being able to spot the tell tale signs of a scam, or how to spot honest projects. People either have that sense, or don't. I've always had a keen sense for spotting bullshit, and fraudulent coins stand out to me quite easily.  I've never got rugged or scammed and I've been in and out of probably 100s of coins. But yes the insurance is a nice option, but again i think that's more for if the coin fails, not \"here's insurance in case we rug pull you\" lol. Or who knows, maybe that's a scam. How did your process of picking this coin differ from all the times you seem to have been scammed?",

People in crypto subs seem to want to demonize regulation and point to the banking sector as why regulation did nothing to help consumers during the financial crisis of 2008. If you actually looked closely at countries around the world, the ones with the tightest regulations on banks survived the 2008 times much better without any bailouts then the countries that don't regulate banks properly. The US and Canada are perfect examples of both sides of that, in the US the banks needed a bailout because the regulations in place let bankers make shady deals and give mortgages to people that couldn't actually qualify, but in Canada where there is much tighter regulations on the banking sector, the major banks didn't need any kind of aid package, since it was against the regulations to do those shady deals.\n\nTDLR: Regulation for the sake of control is bad, regulation to protect consumers from scams, rug pulls and honey pots is good.",

Much easier this way than to produce anything of actual value.\nEventually, the coins with actual use cases will get more and more adopted and the useless coins will fall into obscurity, the volatility will settle down, and the get rich quick crowd will look elsewhere. It will take some time though. But that's why big players like BTC call every coin a $h1tcoin because if more new people don't put their money into BTC, the hodlers won't get the big pay day they're looking for. The entire space is just the greater fool theory personified.\nSure you can get rich betting on some random coin and hope you get lucky, but I personally stick to projects with actual real world value and daily use case other than trading and speculation. Hopefully this nonsense will all be a thing of the past in 5 years.\n\nGood post, op.\nu/chaintip",

The only wallets in crypto that cost money are hardware wallets and they are the safest, so once you build up a stack, you should look into getting one.\n\nSome things to be aware of, each wallet will have a seed phrase or private key. NEVER give that out under any circumstances, if you do, your entire wallet will be emptied. Write the seed phrase on paper and store that in a very safe place. Write it on multiple pieces of paper and store them in separate, secure places if you can. Lastly, never store it electronically, not even a screen shot of it.\n\nIf you find cons in your wallet, that you didn't purchase, don't touch them, they are scam coins designed to entice you to try and swap them. If you do, they will compromise your wallet.\n\nIf you have to use your parent to on ramp fiat or off ramp fiat, make sure you pay for the taxes your gains will incur. The tax people in what ever country you reside in will know that a crypto transaction took place and will want your parents to pay any taxes that your trading or farming have incurred, make sure to budget for that so your parents aren't getting a nasty surprise at the end of the year.\n\nGood luck on your crypto journey and stay safe out there.",

Obviously, DeFi is the financial system of the future. Here is what I suggest, include coins that would teach them the different aspects of the financial institution. For example a coin like **$BMI** for decentralized insurance would not only teach the kid about insurance, they would also get to learn about insurance with respect to DeFi. They would also learn about staking. So, I suggest you always consider the project. Encourage the kid to read about the coins, explain the whitepapers to them. This way, they would probably become masters of the crypto space by the time they're **18**. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, guys please add more suggestions here too.",

Your best better is to find an exchange that you can move it to, once you have enough ETH and sell it on the exchange, then buy something like XRP, XLM or ALGO depending on what EasyCrypto can handle and transfer that and sell it for your NZD. You will still pay gas fees to move it, but save the swap fees, and who knows, maybe it will go up more while you are setting this all up.\n\nEdit: I mention XRP, XLM and ALGO as they are all really cheap to transfer and commonly supported by a lot of crypto places but you could use anything with cheap transfer fees.",

You can pick any of the exchanges mentioned above, there is very little difference between them, some different fee structures but essentially it\u2019s all the same.  I think it\u2019s a good idea to have accounts at more than one, this is helpful when there is a lot of price movement, some exchanges have issues with buy/sell and or transfers so having the ability to purchase at more than one is helpful.  Other than going through KYC there is not cost to opening an account.  I have recently been using Strike a layer two lightning network solution for BTC that allows for free ACH fiat into your account and then you can pay yourself in BTC to an account outside of Strike, and only pay native BTC transactions fees. No exchange fees in the process!  I have been sending Sats to a Celsius account that gets me 6+% yield on my BTC holdings.  This is a good way to DCA small amount into crypto without bleeding exchange fees.",

The biggest advantage is in case one gets compromised for some reason the rest of your assets are safe. It also makes it harder for anyone to track your wealth as it's spread across wallets. It can be annoying if you need to make a purchase that is bigger than what you have in a single wallet but I don't think this is an issue at the moment for most people. But that should be easy to overcome as long as you are not on the ETH network and have to pay huge fees for every transaction. I think it all depends on how much you have and how you want to split things. For now I use 3-4 different wallets, excluding exchanges.",

Can you imagine yourself at the grocery store trying to check out and realizing you can\u2019t make the purchase because some billionaire tweeted and your Bitcoin crashed while you were shopping?\n\nResistance to change certainly is part of it, but for the average consumer, the benefit to using it has to go way up before it starts getting adopted.",

Then they're going to send OP a private message and get his PayPal info or whatever and send the guy 50k to cheer him up.\n\nI'm not sure what's worse, the fact that people really believe this shit might happen, or the fact that maybe it actually does happen?\n\nAnyways, OP, don't know what to say to you other than the fact that you're not the only person on planet Earth that has got themselves into a seriously fucked up pickle. This is life. This is how shit happens.\n\nTruth is, we don't really have anybody or anything to blame. From the time we arrive on planet Earth, till now, we've been making various decisions about things. (also taking actions or not taking actions) These decisions have led us to this exact spot. We have nothing to blame but our previous decisions (and actions/inactions).  If you want to blame something, I guess the blame could be placed on the lottery of parenting.\n\nWe randomly get a set a parents or caretakers (at least it would seem to be random). These parents have a certain way of thinking. There's good aspects to their thinking, and bad aspects. As a child, you're going to naturally end up with some combination of your parents or caretaker's thinking patterns. You'll benefit from some of these patterns, but you'll also suffer. It seems to be a bit of a lottery, so I suppose if somebody wanted to curse and blame something for their misfortune, that's where the blame goes. Because it's really your only legit excuse. \n\nWe get whatever good or bad thinking that we get from our custodians, and then we start making our own decisions about things, and it's these decisions and actions or inactions that really matter.\n\nYou've got to pull yourself up from your bootstraps and take charge of every aspect of your life, and learn the wisdom to understand what shit is out of your control. Keep working the job that you hate, but if you're not going to do anything constructive about this problem, then please stop complaining. What you'll likely need to do is learn some sort of marketable skill, in some subject area that interests you, but also has a pent up demand for those services. You're going to have to sacrifice huge chunks of your free time to learn this new marketable skill. Once you've acquired this marketable skill, then you can start looking for a job in that field, all the while still maintaining your shitty soul-crushing job in the meantime.\n\nEverything has a price. Pay the price or STFU",

The NFT is the token - the code that lives on the blockchain using asymmetric encryption to verify it's legitimacy. Some of these tokens have links to images or whatever - that's what you're thinking of. Whether the image is embedded on the blockchain or linked via IPFS or whatever - it's not the image that you own, it's the token. The token cannot be right-clicked and saved, it has a transaction history backed up by math. The image is absolutely irrelevant to how the NFT works. There is no copyright protection on these tokens - you prove your ownership mathematically on the blockchain. Anyone in the world can save the image your token links to, but they can't take the token.",

That doesn\u2019t stop the \u201cowner\u201d of the YouTube video or art station image or SoundCloud song from \u201cowning\u201d the original content just because I can right click save as or screen capture it.\n\nThe analogy to Mona Lisa is a good one but it\u2019s flawed, you\u2019re right. The problem is that it\u2019s flawed because it\u2019s a comparison of *physical* content to *digital* content. You have to compare an NFT to *another digital asset* in order to have a true comparison.\n\nNow, at the end of the day NFTs don\u2019t have the same ownership protections and regulations as traditional digital intellectual property, but neither did traditional digital intellectual property when it first came about. The fact that the law hasn\u2019t recognized something *yet* is not a justification for anything. The internet will always move faster than the law. The law *still* hasn\u2019t figured out how the hell to handle copyright and ip yet and the internet is already starting to move on.\n\nNFTs have value for the same reason cash has value or the deed to your house has value. Do you own your house because you have a paper that says so, or do you own your house because you protect it with physical force? If someone threatens you with violence to leave your property do they have a legal right to your house anymore? No, of course not, because the *made up paper* still says it\u2019s yours.\n\nOwnership is messy. Possession is 10/10ths of \u201chaving\u201d something, but that\u2019s not the same as \u201cowning\u201d something.",

Scary really, I feel like we'll all end up like the film Wall-E when we're all programmed into a virtual reality and you can see or do whatever you want...

Some of what I say may be more about how I see NFTs operating in the future as opposed to how they actually work now, so please don't nitpick over details and focus on the bigger picture. Why is the actual Mona Lisa so valuable while copies are worthless? Because it's the actual closest link between the artist and/or subject (whoever Davinci actually painted) that we have. Every copy is a layer removed from that. Even the actual Mona Lisa is a layer removed from the subject and the artist who are now long gone. Accepting this, let's imagine a scenario where the Louvre creates a single NFT of the Mona Lisa, embedding as much information as is available about it as possible (e.g. a digital version that allows you to zoom in to a microscopic level, chemical analysis of the paint, etc.). Then, what if the physical Mona Lisa were destroyed? Now the single NFT would be the closest link to it and thereby Davinci and the subject of the painting. The physical painting has value because it is unique and it has some important link to human history. An NFT could provide a digital next best thing in the event the physical object is destroyed.",

If you saw the painting without any context, not knowing that it was painted by a \u201clegend\u201d, would you even give it a second glance? I\u2019d probably look at \u201cStarry Night\u201d before I\u2019d look at the Mona Lisa. And with Van Gogh, his paintings were essentially worthless while he was alive. Then one day society decided they were masterpieces. Too bad no one told him while he was alive. \n\nI really don\u2019t understand the NFT craze myself, but I imagine there was probably a time when the idea of a painting of some chick smiling selling for millions of dollars would have been just as controversial as NFTs are now. \n\nPerhaps as we move into VR and the Metaverse, having an NFT of the Mona Lisa in your digital apartment will be just as impressive as having the real one on your wall.",

Sell gold, characters, after I'm done playing and ready to move on. RMT(real money transactions) are banned. Mostly because it takes money out of the developers pockets and exploits are used to farm items and gold to sell.\n\nNFT makes it to where if i invest money, do good, and the game does good. Well I can not only make my money back, but make MORE money by just playing. Not playing and selling my character. Just playing.",

They could be used in business for tracking assets.

These kind of games are very competitive and some of them have huge numbers of players.
