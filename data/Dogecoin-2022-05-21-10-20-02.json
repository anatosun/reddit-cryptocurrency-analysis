You can also get the private key for this wallet from the SoDogeTip website. You can transfer dogecoins into this wallet address and begin giving dogecoin to other people on reddit! And using your key you can also send coins yourself, even if the tipbot is down\nMaybe you see a meme that made you laugh? Give them a few dogecoin.\nMaybe you see an insightful post that helped you understand something better? Give them a few dogecoin.\nMaybe you see a charity you'd like to donate to. Do it with sodogetip. \n\nYou can also get the latest version of the dogecoin wallet (version  1.14.5) from www.dogecoin.com \n\n---\n\nHere are some links and topics that people have wanted me to post here.

                    "response": "You guys, I need Dogecoin to go to $2,629.107981220657USD because the man I love makes $14k daily and I only have ~$2k dogecoin and I feel like I am really economically behind him. Since I learned his earnings it is really sitting on my mind. I want to get on more equal financial footing. He has tried many times to help me build wealth but I ignore his suggestions because I am too focused on Purpose to focus on Finance\n\nThe most I have focused on finances is analyzing dogecoin, buying stocks (before I met him) and buying options (we talked about it but never agreed on positions) and I have had some luck with stocks but so far no good with options (I made a good call but the stock did a split so it didn\u2019t count) and I am trying to get better at options and doge. I need doge to see Etheruem numbers",
