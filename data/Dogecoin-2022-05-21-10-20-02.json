You can also get the private key for this wallet from the SoDogeTip website. You can transfer dogecoins into this wallet address and begin giving dogecoin to other people on reddit!

Give them a few dogecoin.\nMaybe you see an insightful post that helped you understand something better? Give them a few dogecoin.\nMaybe you see a charity you'd like to donate to.
