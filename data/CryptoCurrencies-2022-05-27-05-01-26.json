It would be catastrophic.\n\nThis is exactly why I believe that stablecoins are the ones that will end up being accepted in mass.\n\nWe\u2019ll soon see the rise of stablecoins into the mainstream alongside projects like E-money and other blockchain based payments platforms that support backed stablecoins.",
