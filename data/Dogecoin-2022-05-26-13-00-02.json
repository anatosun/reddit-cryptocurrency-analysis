Didn't give it another thought until recently when I began dabbling in crypto a bit.\n\nOld wallet was on an old computer, and couldn't get synced with the network. Downloaded Dogecoin Core on a brand new computer, loaded in the old wallet file, and have successfully done a couple of sends to an exchange. But I can't access the Dogecoins that were gifted to me. They show in the wallet, but I can't seem to get to them in order to send. Or withdraw. Or anything.\n\nSo, what do I do to get access to those coins? And can I withdraw to a bank account directly from Dogecoin Core?",

All you need is to instal, run it the first time so it builds its files, then quit and replace the wallet.dat. Make sure that the one you\u2019re swapping in is the most recent backup, because you must make a backup after every transaction, and if you didn\u2019t, some coins may be lost.\n\nSo, having gotten this far, go into the console and use the DUMPWALLET command to create a text file with all your wallets in it.\n\nThis text file becomes your wallet masterfile, and you no longer need core at all. Just grab a copy of the coinb.in website and put it and the text file on multiple removable media stored in safe places. There are also detailed instructions for this if you do some reading in here.\n\nThe text file contains a hundred or more wallets, in three sections.\n\nNamed wallets are the ones you know about, because you requested them or imported them.\n\nChange wallets you don\u2019t know about, and we\u2019re created whenever you sent coins, to receive any change. These are also the reason you needed to do constant backups.\n\nReserve wallets are empty, unused new wallets. If you look them up on bitinfocharts, you will get blank pages.\n\nSo, just look up the wallets on bitinfocharts to find their balances, and comment them appropriately in the text file. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThat\u2019s it. Those two files are all you need. And if you want to send coins, make sure you go offline to sign the transactions so as to never expose your keys to the internet.",

Just \"Dogecoin Wallet\" or something. To play it safe, I did get Core now. Took like 30+ hours to get everything all synced up. Insane.\n\nI can actually see the coins in there. Just can't seem to do anything with them.\n\nAlso, I did try this bitinfo thing. Says \"invalid wallet\" or similar.\n\nThanks again. Appreciate you guys all looking out for each other.",
