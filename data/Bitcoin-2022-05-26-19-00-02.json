None of this stuff is as hard as it sounds btw.\n\nLastly, I'd use a hard wallet, one that has a duress-PIN, like a ColdCard etc. This is a PIN that leads to a real but separate wallet from your main wallet. It's for when someone tries to rob you, but actually is for plausible deniability from the law, like if you're compelled by a judge to provide a PIN, are stopped at the border, etc.",

I\u2019m sure google would know better.\n\nEdit: I googled it, and it depends upon the manufacture of the Bitcoin ATM,  but it appears as long as you make smaller transactions they ask for ID. In order to stay as anonymous as you can, your going to want to buy a cold wallet with a prepaid visa and use someone else\u2019s address. Then you will want to use a vpn when connecting to a PC. \n\nThe only issue is when you want to someday cash out.",
