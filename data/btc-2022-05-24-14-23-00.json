That's like real work... ~~Well I guess if hayden did it at the north Queensland conference it's possible.~~\n\nEdit- I don't know who coordinated the NQ conference, but coordinating a conference requires entirely different skills than posting videos.\n\nAnother edit- I apologize for using a name without knowing the whole story. Obviously it takes a team to pull off a conference. Thank you all for making it memorable, as I only heard good things (and thanks for being the positive example of my point:).",

It would be big sad if it flops due to mismanagement after all the buzz it's created in the community.\n\nI'm eagerly awaiting the \"official\" announcement (and the extra details I'm hoping will be revealed - pricing, venue, sponsors, w/e) next week.",

It's no secret that Cindy Feng was the primary organizer of the last BCH conference and pretty much all credit goes to her. She handled all the planning, logistics, paperwork and organized various venues for the conference itself and side events. \n\nI worked directly with Cindy on a day to day basis and I personally contacted and organized most of the speakers and sponsors. I did all the marketing for the event, did media coverage for the event and built the website with Corentin Mercier. Additionally I will add that I coined the term \"Bitcoin Cash City\" when I made a video by that title on the CoinSpice YouTube channel. I also registered and own the domain BitcoinCashCity.com which was utilized for the conference. It was my idea to do the conference and anyone claiming to be \"Bitcoin Cash City\" today has no affiliation with myself or Cindy Feng, the primary organizers of that event.",
