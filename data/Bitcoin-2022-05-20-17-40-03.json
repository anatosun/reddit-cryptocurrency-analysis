Self-custody in five years will be way easier than it is today. Ease-of-use is a solvable problem, and we're not done solving it.\n\nWe won't be done solving it until usability is so good that it's virtually impossible to mess it up. Bitcoin needs to be easy-to-use and safe to the point that nobody feels anxiety that they might do something wrong and lose their money when they move send their Bitcoin. It will get there.",

If you really understood self-custody (as implemented today), you would know how unreasonable it is to expect most people to do it.\n\nYou don't get to \"be your own bank\" without taking on the responsibilities of a bank, namely handling redundancy and security (physical and digital). Banks invest a lot of money into this, so it's silly to expect that most individuals can cheaply fulfill the same duties for themselves.\n\nRedundancy: People routinely keep inadequate backups and fail to test the backups they might be making.\n\nDigital security: Yeah right. Most people think \"password\" is a good password.\n\nPhysical security: I'm not sure granny has the correct frame to fight off attackers nor the money to hire her own security.",

Otherwise offline miners with their machine sitting there might just launch a 51% attack.\n\nBitcoin currently use 110 terawatt-hour(tWh) per year. So 1 year mining reward need to be more than the cost of 55 tWh (50% of total).\n\nAssume energy price 0.08$/kWh, the minimum annual mining rewards need to be 4.4 billion dollars.\n\nBitcoin transaction fee is $500k/day right now, that is $182.5M/year, far from the required $4.4B/year.\n\nSo yes, this is a legit concern. Fee alone won't be enough to support 50% of all miners unless Bitcoin price 30x. And that is just current machines, new miners are still being produced, so we will need even higher rewards to lure 50% of miners.\n\nThe current block reward 6.25 BTC is around $9.6B/year at current price. If the price doesn't go up, after the next halving, $4.8B/year will be barely enough to secure the network.",

The reward reduces by 50% every 210,000 blocks (approximately every 4 years). The reward reduces to zero very gradually  \n\nDuring the long decades as the reward gradually gets smaller and smaller, fewer miners will mine Bitcoin. For-profit miners will gradually be replaced by hobby miners  \n\n> current transaction fees\n\nFuture fees will be less than current fees  \n\nAn estimate of future fees can be calculated based on the current parameters of Bitcoin and a reasonable scenario about Bitcoin's long-term stable usage  \n\nBitcoin minimum fees are 1 Satoshi per vbyte. A Bitcoin block can contain up to 1 million vbytes of transactions. As Bitcoin's use case settles, blocks might be 60% full on average. Future fees can be estimated as 60% * 1 million * 1 Satoshi, which is 0.006 BTC per block  \n\nRead about Bitcoin's controlled supply mechanism  \nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply  \n\nThe table in that wiki page shows that the block reward will fall to 0.00610351 BTC at the beginning of the 14th reward era, block #2730000, probably in the year 2060. Fee amount and reward amount will be approximately the same until the beginning of the 15th reward era, block #2940000, 4 years later. After that, the fee amount will be greater than the reward amount",
