But dont expect after 10 days u can get another 30%, at that time you\u2019ll either have to stake w them for the long term (they\u2019re making $ at 7%) or withdrawal to other staking platforms (and pay withdraw few which excess the 30% profit on 10 days) or again swap back to your prefer coin which is also fee.\nRegardless, sometimes binance has those deal to attract more liquidity or create fomo, and they take a loss on it, but you can only stake very small amount. So for me i always keep a small number on flexible saving (as for trade/swap/liquid etc) and if they have something like this for the coin that Im holding anyways, I\u2019ll go for it and stake the max they offer for the account. Otherwise it is not worth it tbh, moving coin is more expensive.",
