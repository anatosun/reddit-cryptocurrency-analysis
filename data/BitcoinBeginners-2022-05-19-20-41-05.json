So i went on 20x leverage trading btc for a few days. The price seemed to fluctuate between 29-31k for a while so all i had to do was short it at 31k and long it 29k, worked great for a whooping 2 days, then the third i longed btc 20x leverage at 29k only it didnt go up it went to 26k but i got liquidated at 27.8k and there it went all the winning and the initial profit. After that its a spiral that u need to win back what u lost and more. I never touched my main btc stash and i used a very small amount to do this daytrading stuff so it didnt hurt much but it gave me a full picture of what happens. U work hard for those small wins and can lose them in one bad trade, if u think to implement stop orders to cut your losses u will get rekt by fees. Bottom line DCA and hodl dont daytrade dont leverage trade.",
