Luckily soon there won't be any options for such rugs with greedy VC's like Kwon...AngelBlock is a innovative and needed solution that will totall reconstruct the way fundraising is made in crypto..They had the NFTmint today, sold out more than 50% of the NFT supply that was set up for sale today, in like under 3 hours lol..Ppl at veecon are saying they're the next BAYC in the making",

Terra was actually a pretty good L1 without UST.\nDidn't hold much UST myself but enjoyed using the Terra dapps.\nThat being said, if u buy the LUNA2 token directly you're fucking insane lol. I'm just saying that I plan on using the dapps cuz Terra defi is awesome.",
