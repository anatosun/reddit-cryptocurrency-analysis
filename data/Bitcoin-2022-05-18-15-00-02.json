Basically one of the first posts I read on this sub said \"imagine you have $1000 cash in your hand, now burn it. How does it affect your life? If it's something you won't die to lose then buy BTC.\" \n\nMy take is the last however many years it's always had a major dip, and then it always rose back up.. so why wouldn't it do the same this time? I finally had money to invest and can do without if I lose it. People are saying it will take longer for the price to go back to normal but if people can still use Bitcoin for illegal trading and black market stuff it's always going to have major value. There is only a limited amount available in the world, unlike fiat and in 2024 they half the rewards of mining so it will be even more rare.\n\nBasically the powers that be, the ones who hold enough Bitcoin to make a difference.. If they start deciding that Bitcoin doesn't matter then we all lose out. But I don't really see that happening with all the shady ways Bitcoin can benefit the people who don't want their money tracked.",
