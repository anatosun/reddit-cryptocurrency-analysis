It is for me at least, I love ordering a nice meal with BCH and telling everyone.\n\nToday we bought Sushi using BCH (via Menufy / Bitpay). Order went through in seconds, order was ready right on time. No problems with our little sushi place (we've ordered a few times from there so we know them.)\n\nMy bad order from yesterday - got the refund link from Menufy which authorizes and guides you through refund back to your crypto wallet. Super easy. Menufy and Bitpay work great, never had a problem until I tried that one restaurant we never tried before.\n\nHopefully by this time next year there'll be a few more local businesses accepting crypto directly since I always bug them about it. And you should too.\n\nCan't wait to hear other people's Bitcoin Pizza day stories!",
