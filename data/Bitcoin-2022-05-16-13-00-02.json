The first chapter compares the invention of bitcoin to the dawn of UFC - we finally have a suitable Octagon for all of our free market activities :p\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who has read it :)\n\nMSW - Data Analyst at CoinCorner (the best place to [buy bitcoin](https://www.coincorner.com/))",
