Those are the addresses & keys it will sign transactions for successfully.  So only addresses derived from the phrase you currently have loaded can be sent from.\n\nYou can easily restore a device using a second phrase, but then you can only send from addresses associated with that second phrase (until such time as you restore it using the first phrase, for example).\n\nNone of this affects your ability to see balances and get addresses derived from an xpub.  That's done by software and doesn't require your device to sign anything.  Does that help?",

I\u2019m new to crypto but have been getting down the basics, and recently I\u2019ve decided to accept btc as an option for some goods that I sell. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem:\nSo I decided to open a coinbase account for my crypto needs and use it for my first ever transaction. The account is verified in every way btw. Anyway, I was being sent 1.3k USD worth of BTC (internationally from US to CAD) from my customer through Blockchain, to my coinbase wallet. He is experienced in crypto and has made many purchases using it. \n\nHe sent me the transaction on May 5th, and now today it is may 11th and I have yet to received anything. He said btc transactions are usually \u201cdelayed\u201d but I feel 5 days is a little concerning. Should I be concerned? I asked for a receipt from him that says the transaction is pending but he says it \u201cdoesn\u2019t update until it\u2019s processed\u201d \n\nWhat do u guys think? \n\nTLDR: first time user of coinbase receiving btc from blockchain wallet international transaction from US to CAD. Been 5 days and no btc seen.",

However, there I didn't go into detail of what the drawbacks (and upsides) are of using a mobile phone as a cold storage solution.\n\nAs always, there are pros and cons to every solution. HW wallets are designed with one specific goal in mind and the teams behind them are usually small. Mobile phones are general purpose devices, so the attack vector can be a lot higher. But there are also many more people and security teams working on making mobile phones more secure (eg. enterprise environments).  \nSo ultimately, it's up to every person to decide what they see as more secure and less risky. I for one think that the security of a properly managed mobile phone (meaning it's factory reset, always offline, not used for any other purpose) is very high. Most of the exploits that affect mobile phones are usually introduced by browsing the web or installing malicious apps. But if your device is offline, it's almost impossibly for malware to enter the mobile phone unless there is a backdoor in the official stock iOS/Android firmware.\n\nAnother advantage of a mobile phone is that it has a big screen. This means that it is much easier to verify transaction details (eg. the amounts and recipients). It is also easier to show warnings and tips to the user. The usability is also much better because all the tutorials and explanations can be done on the device itself, so the UX is generally better in my opinion.\n\nMobile phones also have more computing power and storage, so more data can be stored that make transactions more secure (eg. you could store a blacklist of known scam addresses, or add contract information that allows you to decode contract calls, etc.)\n\nWhen using a mobile phone as a signer, the communication is usually done over QR codes, not over cables. This means that your key is truly air-gapped and is never connected to an online device. (Some HW wallets such as ColdCard can be used in an air-gapped fashion as well).\n\nAnd then a last point is the fact that the device is simply a mobile phone. This means that in case the device breaks, it's easy to get a replacement. There are no supply shortages because you are tied to a specific manufacturer, and you while some countries have restrictions regarding HW wallets, this doesn't happen with mobile phones.  \nThe fact that it's a regular mobile device is also great because it means if you ever travel through customs, or a thief enters your house, they will think that it's simply an old smartphone, they will not immediately think \"cryptocurrency\".\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!",

We like that our project is not tied to a specific manufacturer or HW wallet. This gives users the freedom to use whatever device they feel most comfortable with (eg. you can also run AirGap Vault on a desktop or laptop if you want).\n2. Creating a secure HW wallet is hard. You have to work with chip manufacturers, create your own (secure) designs, etc. At the current stage, we prefer to focus our effort on software.",

For Bitcoin, we have an option to use the BC-UR standard, so you can use AirGap Vault as a signer with a variety of watch-only wallets, such as BlueWallet, Sparrow or Specter.\n\nAirGap Vault itself never requires any internet connection, just like a HW wallet. The communication with the online device is done over QR codes, which has a couple of advantages compared to cables.\n\nThe project is completely open source and free. Our app is also reproducible, however, due to some recent issues where builds were randomly not reproducible, the status on walletscrutiny is currently \"not reproducible\" (if you read the analysis, it will state that the latest version is in fact reproducible, but until mentioned issue is addressed, it will stay \"not reproducible\"). We're working with walletscrutiny to resolve this and it looks like we have resolved the issue with the latest release, but it will take some time to verify it. (see [https://github.com/airgap-it/airgap-vault/issues/127](https://github.com/airgap-it/airgap-vault/issues/127)).\n\nLet us know if you have any feedback!\n\nEdit: I didn't state this explicitly because the question already contained it, but our solution should only be considered very secure if it is used with a dedicated, factory reset device that will always stay offline.\n\nEdit2: We have a tutorial on how a secure offline device can be set up: https://support.airgap.it/airgap-vault/setup/secure-cold-wallet-airgap-android",

You can use your phone to have a wallet that has no private key, no seed, and no password to lose, forget or be stolen by someone else. \n\nWhat you are really asking is how you can have a secure wallet in your pocket. What is more secure than a wallet that cannot be taken over by anyone else and used only by you. Think about it even hardware wallets can be restored by anyone who finds or gets your seed. Worse you could make a mistake and not be able to recover\n\nDisclosure: i am the CEO of such a wallet. But new progress in cryptography and MPC makes it possible to create a wallet without using the typical private key system and providing a distributed security system instead. That means that there is no single point of failure. No single secret that can compromise your wallet. \n\nTry it and let me know what you think about it.",

                    "response": "This is a bit too paranoid IMHO, most metal wallet backups are too obscure for anyone to really know what they are or what they are used for. \n\nIf you prefer you can simply make your own -\n\nUse 1/8 or 4mm at the largest stamp kit\n\nexample \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Piece-Letter-Number-Stamping-Set/dp/B006ZB9P4K/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=1%2F8in+Stamping+36-Piece&qid=1588981849&sr=8-1\n\n\nIs not intended to punch steel but brass or copper (do not use aluminum as that will distort and warp in fires). \n\nNow you may be thinking that Its easiest to preset the words before hand and place them in a vice, mold, or tape them together and than use a hammer to smack the whole word at the same time but you would be wrong due to \n\n1) It is much better you hit the stamps with a large amount of force  the first time, and the more your repeat the more chance it will slightly shift leading to double/tipple stamped letters (slightly blurry double vision result ) \n\n2) The letters are tricky to position the right way in a set because they are mirror images of what you intend to stamp and easier to do one at a time . Doing the letters one at a time seems like it would take longer but is quicker in reality\n\n3) The spacing is too much even if you have them side by side unless you do them one at a time \n\nP.S... the 6 and 9 is the same bit in these sets so you just reuse that \n\nP.S.S. technically you only need to stamp out the first 4 letters in BIP 39 backups as those are always unique , but with the 1/8 set you can stamp out the whole word so it looks better with the size of that metal plate above \n\n--------------------------------\n\n\n100mm x 150mm x 0.9 mm copper\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/0-8mm-100mm-150mm-99-9-Copper/dp/B07GGX3ZSL/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=100mm+x+150mm+plate&qid=1606673306&sr=8-1\n\n\n\n-----------------------\n\nOther tips - \n\n1) Never stamp your passphrase on the same metal plate as the 12 to 24 seed words. When using the passphrase feature found in certain wallets you want the passphrase to be recorded on paper or preferably metal separate than the backup 12/24 words for better security  (you are essentially making something similar to a 2 of 2 multisig)\n\nhttps://wiki.trezor.io/Passphrase\n\nhttps://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005214529-Advanced-passphrase-security\n\nhttps://coldcardwallet.com/docs/passphrase\n\n2) In the extra field stamp the derivation address used in your wallet or at least the wallet name that you used to create the private keys . \n\nHere is an excellent site telling you all the default derivation paths \n\nhttps://walletsrecovery.org\n\n3) Place the brass or copper on some soft wood while stamping it to absorb the impact and allow for better stamps \n\n\nOr \n\nhttps://safu.ninja/\n\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4590734\n\nhttps://estudiobitcoin.com/fabrica-tu-billetera-fria-con-arandelas/",

I'm worried about LN's inability to find a or the fastest/cheapest way through the network by itself. Instead, it just takes a nearly predetermined route through the most reliable nodes which will be the biggest and most funded nodes. From that point in time these nodes will suck up most traffic and will gain more over time. That way the payment traffic gets more and more centralized over time until the point where some nodes serve most part of the network and payments through it. I just dislike that idea very much.\n\nThat's how I got it",

Therefore I would never use a wallet-client that was not fully compliant with the BIPs.\n\nI consider the derivation path, gap limit etc recovery issues separate from the seed compatibility one discussed here.\n\nAs far as the OP specific issue goes, the full answer is, IF you want an interoperable Seed Recovery Phrase, AND you insist on using Electrum to generate your seed, THEN make sure you do not use their default proprietary (non BIP compatible) mode, and test the recover process in lots of wallet-clients that do claim interoperability, before using it to manage high value funds.",

Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. \n\nBitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. \n\n\nThere are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties\n\nYou are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft \n\nYou are exposed to exit theft \n\nYou are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit\n\nYou place Bitcoin as a whole under more systemic risk by tempting exchanges to use fractional reserve banking and giving them too much influence\n\nYou potentially reduce the probability that your investment will appreciate in value because no exchanges are doing provable audits and they might be fractional. The more Bitcoin you personally control the more likely it will appreciate in value.\n\n**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet, custodian , or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**",

Many exchanges have free  or very low cost withdrawals (look at the chart in the pinned FAQ) . When its time to sell your bitcoin (much wiser just to spend your bitcoin as you can avoid fees and save 3-20% off everything you buy with bitcoin ) you send your bitcoin back to the exchange and sell for fiat . Sending bitcoin onchain can be as cheap as 5-20 cents fee",

This is not possible for me under any circumstance since i travel a lot. I would either have to trust it to a multisig hardware setup with a person, a bank or travel around with it.\n\nObviously all of these scenarios are unaccepable. Even keeping it in a bank vault leaves counterparty risk and the fact that i have to literally fly to a different country to get my keys.\n\nAlso i wont be traveling around Mexico with my hardware wallet any time soon.\n\nWhat i would really like is a sort of online multisig setup. Now im no computer scientist but i envision that you could possibly set up some sort of secure custodial service online with multisig and encryption to keep it safe. I've seen this for large institutional investors but not for retail investors. I'm aware that theres counterparty risk in using and service and software also, but since i cant use hardware i dont see any alternative?\n\nThanks in advance for any help",

The passphrase would be backed up but kept separately from the 12 to 24 word seed.\n\nAlso there is a third problem with that term as it insinuates that there are only 24 word seed backups and the passphrase is the \"25th word\" which is also wrong.

I would feel reluctant to use a passphrase if I felt that a device that could have been tampered in a supply chain attack has stored not only my seed phrase but also its passphrase.

(I believe Rene did a 1 BTC transaction on LN)\n\nMaybe in the future, if you have more high-value channels, you can do 5 BTC transactions on LN for a lower fee.\n\nAnd if you do a high-value transaction, the safety or stability of the blockchain is more critical than confirmation time.

Coinbase then gives back $5 for setting up reoccurring purchase.  Coinbase also gives 5% interest for holding Cosmos.

Bitcoin difficulty dynamically adjusts both ways insuring efficient miners will continue to mine regardless the price.  During this time when bitcoin had no market price people were treating it as a collectable, the same thing would occur if it happened again but this time security would be much higher as many of us already own ASICs. Of course hash rate would be much lower due to the incentives for profit not existing and it being done by enthusiasts for fun and to support the network.\n\nThose that suggest 0 is even possible are reflecting deep levels of ignorance as even obsolete and \"dead\" currencies fetch a price however.

They might not be traded on any popular exchange but can still fetch a price. You can go on ebay or other sites and buy dead Nigerian or confederate bills. The same is true for many obsolete altcoins , there is a very long tail of value because cryptocurrencies are extremely divisible so can still fetch very small fractions of a penny in value \n\nThis is what I mean when I say it is very ignorant when people suggest Bitcoin can go to 0. Even many obscure altcoins that almost every person believes its a scam can fetch a price. That price might be difficult to determine because its being trading peer to peer but it often exists. \n\nFor Bitcoin to go to 0 would mean that ~160 million people would need to lose interest in it which is extremely unlikely to occur in the next 50-100 years  \n\nall it takes is 2 people to create a market price",

Every trading exchange quotes the price of the most recent transaction on that exchange. Nobody would execute a zero-price transaction on an exchange, so the price is never zero  \n\n###Bitcoin has value as a payment method  \n\nIf my shoe seller has been excluded from participating in the centralized payment gateways, I can send Bitcoin  \n\nThe value of Bitcoin is that it facilitated that shoe purchase because that merchant is no longer excluded from receiving payments for Internet sales  \n\nWhat numeric value does this transaction contribute to the world economy? Some amount greater than zero  \n\nWhat should be the price of Bitcoin to enable this shoe transaction? It doesn't really matter. If the USD amount I spend to buy the Bitcoin is the same as the USD amount the merchant receives for immediately selling the Bitcoin, then Bitcoin successfully facilitated the transaction  \n\nIf someone can spend 10,000 BTC to buy 2 pizzas, I can spend 10,000 BTC to buy a pair of shoes  \nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Laszlo_Hanyecz",
