However, there I didn't go into detail of what the drawbacks (and upsides) are of using a mobile phone as a cold storage solution.\n\nAs always, there are pros and cons to every solution. HW wallets are designed with one specific goal in mind and the teams behind them are usually small. Mobile phones are general purpose devices, so the attack vector can be a lot higher. But there are also many more people and security teams working on making mobile phones more secure (eg. enterprise environments).  \nSo ultimately, it's up to every person to decide what they see as more secure and less risky. I for one think that the security of a properly managed mobile phone (meaning it's factory reset, always offline, not used for any other purpose) is very high. Most of the exploits that affect mobile phones are usually introduced by browsing the web or installing malicious apps. But if your device is offline, it's almost impossibly for malware to enter the mobile phone unless there is a backdoor in the official stock iOS/Android firmware.\n\nAnother advantage of a mobile phone is that it has a big screen. This means that it is much easier to verify transaction details (eg. the amounts and recipients). It is also easier to show warnings and tips to the user. The usability is also much better because all the tutorials and explanations can be done on the device itself, so the UX is generally better in my opinion.\n\nMobile phones also have more computing power and storage, so more data can be stored that make transactions more secure (eg. you could store a blacklist of known scam addresses, or add contract information that allows you to decode contract calls, etc.)\n\nWhen using a mobile phone as a signer, the communication is usually done over QR codes, not over cables. This means that your key is truly air-gapped and is never connected to an online device. (Some HW wallets such as ColdCard can be used in an air-gapped fashion as well).\n\nAnd then a last point is the fact that the device is simply a mobile phone. This means that in case the device breaks, it's easy to get a replacement. There are no supply shortages because you are tied to a specific manufacturer, and you while some countries have restrictions regarding HW wallets, this doesn't happen with mobile phones.  \nThe fact that it's a regular mobile device is also great because it means if you ever travel through customs, or a thief enters your house, they will think that it's simply an old smartphone, they will not immediately think \"cryptocurrency\".\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!",

For Bitcoin, we have an option to use the BC-UR standard, so you can use AirGap Vault as a signer with a variety of watch-only wallets, such as BlueWallet, Sparrow or Specter.\n\nAirGap Vault itself never requires any internet connection, just like a HW wallet. The communication with the online device is done over QR codes, which has a couple of advantages compared to cables.\n\nThe project is completely open source and free. Our app is also reproducible, however, due to some recent issues where builds were randomly not reproducible, the status on walletscrutiny is currently \"not reproducible\" (if you read the analysis, it will state that the latest version is in fact reproducible, but until mentioned issue is addressed, it will stay \"not reproducible\"). We're working with walletscrutiny to resolve this and it looks like we have resolved the issue with the latest release, but it will take some time to verify it. (see [https://github.com/airgap-it/airgap-vault/issues/127](https://github.com/airgap-it/airgap-vault/issues/127)).\n\nLet us know if you have any feedback!\n\nEdit: I didn't state this explicitly because the question already contained it, but our solution should only be considered very secure if it is used with a dedicated, factory reset device that will always stay offline.\n\nEdit2: We have a tutorial on how a secure offline device can be set up: https://support.airgap.it/airgap-vault/setup/secure-cold-wallet-airgap-android",

This is not possible for me under any circumstance since i travel a lot. I would either have to trust it to a multisig hardware setup with a person, a bank or travel around with it.\n\nObviously all of these scenarios are unaccepable. Even keeping it in a bank vault leaves counterparty risk and the fact that i have to literally fly to a different country to get my keys.\n\nAlso i wont be traveling around Mexico with my hardware wallet any time soon.\n\nWhat i would really like is a sort of online multisig setup. Now im no computer scientist but i envision that you could possibly set up some sort of secure custodial service online with multisig and encryption to keep it safe. I've seen this for large institutional investors but not for retail investors. I'm aware that theres counterparty risk in using and service and software also, but since i cant use hardware i dont see any alternative?\n\nThanks in advance for any help",

I would suggest selling those Bitcoin IOUs you have on Robinhood and withdrawing the fiat, sending the fiat to an exchange listed in the FAQ and than buying bitcoin you can actually use , spend, control. \n\nBitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. \n\nBitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. \n\n\nThere are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties\n\nYou are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft \n\nYou are exposed to exit theft \n\nYou are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit\n\nYou place Bitcoin as a whole under more systemic risk by tempting exchanges to use fractional reserve banking and giving them too much influence\n\nYou potentially reduce the probability that your investment will appreciate in value because no exchanges are doing provable audits and they might be fractional. The more Bitcoin you personally control the more likely it will appreciate in value.\n\n**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet, custodian , or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**",

Those are the addresses & keys it will sign transactions for successfully.

When using the passphrase feature found in certain wallets you want the passphrase to be recorded on paper or preferably metal separate than the backup 12/24 words for better security  (you are essentially making something similar to a 2 of 2 multisig)\n\nhttps://wiki.trezor.io/Passphrase\n\nhttps://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005214529-Advanced-passphrase-security\n\nhttps://coldcardwallet.com/docs/passphrase\n\n2) In the extra field stamp the derivation address used in your wallet or at least the wallet name that you used to create the private keys . \n\nHere is an excellent site telling you all the default derivation paths \n\nhttps://walletsrecovery.org\n\n3) Place the brass or copper on some soft wood while stamping it to absorb the impact and allow for better stamps \n\n\nOr \n\nhttps://safu.ninja/\n\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4590734\n\nhttps://estudiobitcoin.com/fabrica-tu-billetera-fria-con-arandelas/",

I\u2019m new to crypto but have been getting down the basics, and recently I\u2019ve decided to accept btc as an option for some goods that I sell. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem:\nSo I decided to open a coinbase account for my crypto needs and use it for my first ever transaction. The account is verified in every way btw. Anyway, I was being sent 1.3k USD worth of BTC (internationally from US to CAD) from my customer through Blockchain, to my coinbase wallet. He is experienced in crypto and has made many purchases using it. \n\nHe sent me the transaction on May 5th, and now today it is may 11th and I have yet to received anything. He said btc transactions are usually \u201cdelayed\u201d but I feel 5 days is a little concerning. Should I be concerned? I asked for a receipt from him that says the transaction is pending but he says it \u201cdoesn\u2019t update until it\u2019s processed\u201d \n\nWhat do u guys think? \n\nTLDR: first time user of coinbase receiving btc from blockchain wallet international transaction from US to CAD. Been 5 days and no btc seen.",
