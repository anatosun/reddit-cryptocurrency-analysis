Why is it that Optimism and Arbitrum can be added to Metamask as separate networks while Immutable X and Loopring users simply have to connect to Ethereum mainnet?\n\n3. What are the gas fees on Arbitrum and Optimism currently like when transacting with them on marketplaces? Cents, fraction of a cent, 1-2 dollars, 5+ dollars?\n\n4. What bridge service do most people use to move Polygon & BSC assets to ---> Arbitrum & Optimism?\n\n5.
