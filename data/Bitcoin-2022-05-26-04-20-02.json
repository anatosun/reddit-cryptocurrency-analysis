Every second they aren't running they are losing potential bitcoin and potentially making a loss.\n\nA global, coordinated ban takes time. As miners switch off the difficulty will drop, if it drops far enough then GPU mining becomes viable again, you can't really ban that.\n\nI'm not saying it's good but it's not \"shit hits the fan\" bad. Miners are just paid security actors, they are useful tools for bitcoin, not essential to its running.",

Despite their outright ban they still contribute a large amount to the global hashrate.\n\nAnd, for the sake of arguement, if they do manage to do it, then under these exceptional circumstances concensus can be achieved about an alternative means of mining (like alter the pow algo to go back to GPU friendly means of mining, so that bitcoin can weather the storm, though this would be extremely drastic and I cannot stress enough how ugly that fight would be).",
