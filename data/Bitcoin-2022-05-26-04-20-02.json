The miners can be used to help stabilize demand. \n\nIt allows power companies to invest more into green energy as when demand is low but the green energy sources are producing, electricity its not \"wasted\". But when demand picks back up and the green energy sources are still producing they can turn the miners off thus powering more homes with green energy sources instead of coal/natural gas.\n\nIn my opinion bitcoin and power companies are a match made in heaven and it only makes sense for the power companies to want to stabilize demand as much as possible so they can over build with green energy sources.",
