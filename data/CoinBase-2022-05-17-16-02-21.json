This addition will help users purchase NFTs on several marketplaces including OpenSea, Solis, Rarible and Coinbase\u2019s own NFT platform; trade on decentralized exchanges including Uniswap and Sushiswap; and borrow and lend through Defi platforms including Curve and Compound.  \n\nThese features will be powered by Coinbase's new dapp wallet and browser. \nThe company said it's rolling out the new services in the U.S. on Android first to a limited subset of users, with plans to expand to all users and platforms soon.  \u201cOver 95% of the nearly 300 million cryptocurrency investors worldwide have not ventured beyond a centralized exchange,\u201d\n\n Andrew Thurman of blockchain analytics firm Nansen told CoinDesk. \u201cThis move by Coinbase has the potential to give a new wave of users the chance to explore the frontier of DeFi and NFTs.\u201d  I sincerely feel it's very smart for coinbase to do that now I don't have to use so many platforms when I can just use one for all. Any other coinbase users that enjoy the new update?  Source: \n\n\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/16/coinbase-expands-features-allowing-some-app-users-to-access-ethereum-based-dapps/.",
