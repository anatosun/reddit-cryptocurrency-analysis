            "selftext": "Okay, so first of all, full disclosure: I dont own BCH, i dont even like BCH, and I dont ask this as a person who is likely to change either of those things. I am strictly a Monero person, at this time. But I am curious, because BCH encompasses a higher market cap than Monero at this time, and a large portion of liberty-minded individuals. And its just a question Ive never thought to ask straightforwardly. (Also this doesnt have to be strictly about Monero, there were other coins at the time too like Dash, but I want to focus on Monero.)\n\nMonero was created in 2014, BCH 3 years later in 2017. \n\nIf this isnt a strawman, I believe the *sole* or at least *main* reason for forking was to increase the blocksize limit, to allow for onchain scaling. Okay. But Monero already solved this problem with the automatic blocksize limit. And this is a particularly novel solution, because it solves both sides of the equation: It prevents spam by keeping the ceiling close to usage, and it prevents consensus failure of increasing the limit in the future, since its automatic.\n\nNow I could just stop here, because the blocksize limit seems to be the main point of contention in BCH. If so, how did Monero not fix it? Why was BCH needed?\n\n(And its not like Monero is some random coin, its been *the* privacy coin, *the* darknet coin, and *the* cryptoanarchist coin for years. Fair distribution, adoption, and strong track record.)\n\nI dont want to go on a long spiel detailing every reason why i think Monero solves every importantly solvable blockchain problem ever, because im sure i will have plenty of time engage with such ideas in the comments. But I would like to generally know why 1) You did not want to join Monero instead of create BCH and 2) Why your preference still lies with BCH?\n\nHeres some examples of responses:\n\nA) Didnt know Monero existed (and still doesnt? idk)\n\nB) Ideologically opposed to privacy by default?\n\nC) It *has* to be Bitcoin? (Leftover maximalism type of feelings? Or emotional attachment?)\n\n\nIdk this really all that comes to me at the top of my head. Im having a hard time imagining what the reasons could be.\n\nFeel free to list 1 to 3 solid reasons. Nonnegotiables. Please no \"I like Monero too i just like BCH more\" responses with no substantiation, i would like cold hard data. If you have a criticism of Monero, give it to me hot. \n\nAlso please avoid long lists of negotiables, with no single strong reason (nonnegotiable) tying it all together. Creating a long list of loosely cohesive reasons for something is usually argument with poor structural integrity, aka coming up with reasons to meet parity with ones feelings.\n\nAnyways, interested to hear the responses.",

And i will have to disagree, an automatic limit implies it is natural.\n\n> and therefore an artificial prop up of fees.\n\nMaybe slightly, to reduce spam, but Monero transactions are still cheap, oftentimes under a penny.\n\n>  If it exists there will be discussions on the size and the same problem arises as above.\n\nWhat?!? No there wont. Its an automatic limit. You dont have to touch it ever. The Monero network will automatically scale as needed, while preventing spam.\n\n> And the more people use the chain the more expensiv it gets, cutting off the poorest of us.\n\nNo because the automatic limit would just expand dude.\n\n> Options are always better.\n\nPersonally i would not reccomend someone use a KYC CEX ever.\n\n> Besides the risk of hidden inflation bugs, there is the need for transparent transactions.\n\nI dont think there can be any hidden inflation bugs. The cryptography is testably verifiable. And Monero supports transparent transactions via view keys.\n\n> On BCH the privacy is optional but easy to achieve. I like this a lot more.\n\nIt doesnt have any decentralized privacy though.

Greed did not adequately explain the *very steep* emissions curve, resulting in an 80% pre-mine for me. However it makes sense if you want to be able to claim than it was invented before the shut-down of Silk Road. Controlling 80% of the transactions on the network would also allow a TLA to decode the transaction graph: since they would know which transactions are decoys most of the time. The NSA [loves doing shit where they have access, but can cryptographically prove others do not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG).\n\nUnlike others in this thread, I actually *like* the \"tail emission\", and would not be opposed to adding it to Bitcoin eventually. Some people are wedded to the \"fixed cap\" though.\n\nThere is also the matter of Bitcoin having better mobile wallet support. Though I guess light wallets are possible if you share a \"view key\" with the server you are using. In practice, any host serving your electrum based, or even SPV-based wallet will have your transaction history anyways.",

Cakewallet didn't exist (?).\n\nDownloading a full blockchain, while traveling, was the deal-breaker for me.\n\nIt looks like it's getting much better. And they seem like a good group of people.\n\nIn general, consider the practice of valuing anything by it's fiat market value. The Federal Reserve has increased the M3 monetary supply 50% in the last three years, and it CAN'T stop, because they're trying to print themselves out of a 40x leverage crisis. We haven't started to see the 24% inflation that comes from increasing the monetary supply 24% a year, it's on a three year lag.\n\nIf you want to be rich, identify structural problems in the market that cause certain assets to be over-valued while others are undervalued. \n\nYou know from Monerun that a large number of exchanges have lent their coins, presumably to shorts. The first project, or group of projects, that band together to exploit that structural problem will have more fiat value than could ever need\u2014if they wanted fiat whatsoever in a hyper-inflationary period.\n\nThe downside loss potential from shorting 100 XMR is greater than the current fiat market cap of the entire crypto market. \n\nPresently, the exchanges in question can simply suspend all XMR withdraws and stop a squeeze. They won't go to Kraken and buy real coins to cover their users because they know some Monero users decide to wait it out. \n\nConsider how BCH can be useful to the Monero community with it's current predicament. Does Binance, et al, allow BCH withdraws? Can users get assets off insolvent exchanges with BCH, LTC, BTC & ETH and then swap back using haveno?\n\nThe structural issue of naked-shorting in crypto is manipulating the price and it's not something that can be solved by one community acting alone.",

(Oddly, they didn't put this requirement on many subsequent forks!)\nSentiment was not in favor of a naked \"hashwar\" between BTC and BCH, potentially destroying the value of both in the process. Miners didn't want that, obviously.\n\nBCH also had to make provision for potentially having a lower hashrate (ie. being a minority hashrate chain), for despite having large community support, it's support among the mining pools was mixed. Definitely not a clear majority who were willing to put money into this fight of ideals.\n\nThe new name 'Bitcoin Cash' was proposed by a supporting exchange / mining company and accepted as a way to distinguish from the incumbent coin while drawing attention to the perceived function of this system.\n\nThe opponents tried to make life difficult by pushing the re-branding to 'bcash' which failed. Still, I think even some exchanges listed it as that.",

Think about your words. What makes it \"The\" Git repository? Its \"The\" Git repository because thats what the overwhelming consensus of nodes (including miners, users, and exchanges) are using. \n\nAt the end of the day, BTC kept the ticker because thats what the consensus of the community wanted, and it kept the higher price for the same reason.\n\nSatoshi nor Gavin ever had control of the Github.

The community just decided to follow, autonomously.\n\n> and booted out Gavin Andresen (a big blocker and the one Satoshi passed the torch to\n\nThis is a common lie told in BCH. Nobody booted Gavin out of anything. Nobody took any power away from him. He stopped being active and the community moved on without him. Its not like Bitcoin uses some democratic voting enclave that would allow developers to forcibly eject each other.\n\n> So even though BCH needed a new ticker, the change was simply to increase the block size which Satoshi said was inevitable and the person he handed the keys to wanted to implement.\n\nIronically, when the BCH fork finally happened, it didnt even have enough usage to warrant a 1 mb blocksize much less 8 or 32 megabytes. I guess it wouldve been pretty bad PR though to fork and not immediately increase it.\n\n> So yes, BTC is Bitcoin, but people here believe that BCH is also Bitcoin and at some point we will be able to drop the \"cash\" suffix.\n\nWill never happen. This would result in fraud, lost coins all over the board. You HAVE to specify what you are using. And theres no imaginable timeline where BTC just rolls over, dies, and stops existing. BCH could flippen it, but BTC would still exist. And if it did happen BSV and other scams will be fighting you for it.",

                    "response": "First of all, I've been lurking through these conversations. Thanks for making this post and asking these questions. It's too bad you are getting down voted so much because you've made some good points and have had a fair discussion.\n\nI was a Bitcoin owner prior to the block size wars. I didn't even know I was a big blocker until after the split. I couldn't weed through the propaganda and theoretical arguments so I just held steady until things worked themselves out. My goal was to have magic internet money that could be sent to anyone for a very low fee without being censored. If I remember correctly, even BTC promised that this was their solution with SegWit2x to increase transaction efficiency and block size. So I didn't now who to believe. Fast forward and it became clear to me that the BTC camp was wrong and BCH kept their promises. Turns out that I was a BCHer the whole time (even pre 2017).\n\nNow to answer your questions. I currently hold more BCH than XMR, but I am equally a fan of both projects. But I didn't get into XMR until recently. Why did I choose BCH?\n1. I didn't know about XMR\n2. When I finally did learn about XMR, I thought it was just for drug dealers. I didn't even know how to get it. (I used coinbase)\n3. One concern with privacy by default is I assumed there was a higher risk of being banned by governments. Still is, but I dont care about that anymore. Good riddance to them.\n\nNow onto the reasons why I am still pro BCH and not a Monero maxi. \n4. I think the ease of use of BCH is much better than XMR. 0-conf in BCH works just like PayPal. Transaction sent, phone pings, funds received, and you can send them again instantly. \n5. Scalability - BCH has SPV nodes which allows anyone to verify if a transaction is valid without relying on a central server or downloading the whole block chain. It is even more efficient than pruned nodes. If you aren't familiar with SPV nodes, check it out. I don't think this would be possible in Monero based on how the block chains work. \n\nEdit: 6. I forgot about tail emissions. When I first heard about tail emissions I immediately disregarded Monero as an inflationary scam coin. Years later when I finally decided to learn about Monero, I realized it isn't endless inflationary. It is fixed inflation that can be calculated and trends towards 0. I still don't know if I'd say fixed vs tail emission is better, but I think both options are reasonable so I'm glad we've got competing options to see which ends up working better.\n\nIn summary, I am equally a fan of both coins. I think there will be room for more than one crypto when this all shakes out, so I think they will both continue to complement each other. I think BCH wins the scaling and usability aspects and Monero wins the privacy aspect. But both can achieve all three of those aspects if you had to choose just one coin.\n\nI think our communities have a lot of common beliefs and goals so hopefully we stay friendly. Thanks again for your post!",

I think onchain scaling on Monero will roll smooth, and I do hope to see private and decentrslized L2s eventually...\n\nOn principle, I could never touch a surveillance coin (thats what i call non-privacy coin). Its equally terrifying as it is dangerous imo. It permanently etches your financial history into a public global ledger. Its doxxing, information govts and feds love to have. I dont trust coinmixing, it could have surveillance backdoors, and it only delinks two points in time. Plus theres tainted coins and how that could hurt innocent people, especially people using DEXes where tainted coins flourish most.\n\nI wish more people in crypto cared about privacy and fungibility.",

But there is a very important upside to a public ledger: a ledger that is public! Everyone can read it! Some use cases call for everyone (including code) being able to verify and trace what happened. The publicly readable traversable blockchain is like a framework, a platform,a scaffolding with visible verifiable handholds. \n\nPlease be open minded about this simple example. It's just an example I'm making up right now. Consider a lottery where everyone sends an amount of their choosing to a single receiving address, and then the one who sent the second most as of midnight (the winner) automatically gets the total balance of the wallet sent to them at midnight. With this game everyone can verify the winner is valid and that the winnings were sent to the proper winner. The public nature of the Blockchain in this case (and many more relevant cases) is an asset. Maybe a dev could express this more succinctly.\n\nTo enjoy the default nature of Monero privacy you must sacrifice use cases that require open readability. \n\nI like them both but one is not a replacement for the other.",
