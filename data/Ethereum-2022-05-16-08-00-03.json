The tip portion of transaction fees (the bit that isn't burnt) is going to miners and they are also able to get any MEV.\n\nWhen the Merge occurs the miners disappear from the system, the block rewards for stakers are unchanged, but they will begin to get the tips and have access to the MEV. In the short run this will probably cause a spike in rewards, though lots of people will probably then decide to start staking so in the long term a lower equilibrium may be reached.",
