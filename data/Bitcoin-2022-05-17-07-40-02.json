What was a +$2 trillion sector (before the crash) should have at least showed some signs of starting to fulfill it's intended inflation hedge purpose. This honestly should have been it's time to shine in many ways and it just didn't happen. \n\nIf it did hold up during this period, then it would have been a complete game changer. \n\nHowever I'm sorry, but there is no evidence yet to suggest that BTC is any sort of hedge against inflation. \n\nAt best, BTC has been a great investment because of speculation and little more. I think everyone can agree on that point at least. It hasn't really made an impact beyond that. \n\nAlso this whole El Salvador nonsense is a joke haha May as well say \"Antarctica now accepts BTC\".

E. Neither the meeting in Quito nor the one in El Salvador are general meetings of the AFI, just different specific working groups.\n\nSource : https://www.facebook.com/195596497157953/posts/5412469245470626/\n\nInterestingly, the DFSWG has the following planned deliverable :\n\nSpecial report to introduce members to CBDCs from a financial inclusion context, deliver an understanding of the underlying motivation, design choices and approach, risk mitigation options and provide insights into policy and regulatory implications to be considered in the evaluation of CBDC within an inclusive, sustainable, and secure financial system context.\n\nSource: https://www.afi-global.org/working-groups/dfs/",
