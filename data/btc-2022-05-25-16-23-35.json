Consider whether regulatory capture is a central tenet in the following scenarios:\n\n- When you are trading mechanical services for your neighbor's eggs.\n- When a transport or communications service facilitates your commerce with persons farther away than your neighbor.\n- After a territorial monopoly forms and uses the threat of undesirable consequences to impose its will.\n\nIn which of these scenarios can regulatory capture become an ongoing feature?  I say in the third scenario, after the territorial monopoly's picked winners in currency, communications, utilities, postal services, insurance, banking, etc, use business models which depend upon the undesirable consequences.  So in my view governments covering vast territories make regulatory capture possible.  Also, we are using the term capitalism, but I think it is a misleading term.",

Nothing more nothing less. \"Competition\" is a buzzword. Capitalists don't want competitors and smart business strategy seeks to destabilize, undermine, or acquire competition. Monopoly is profitable.\n\nSome industries do not benefit greatly from mass economies of scale, or are not impacted by network effects. These usually remain decentralized without regulation. Other industries benefit from centralizing effects like mass economies of scale or network effects. These centralize strongly without regulation.\n\nThe idea that unfettered competition always leads to a more decentralized and equatible business environment is a misunderstanding.  For example when radio deregulated in the 1990s the number of players in the market dropped from thousands to a dozen or so. In some markets one or two companies own every station on the dial.\n\nAdam Smith warned about the problems of market failures, and economics (past the 1st year survey classes) teaches us about the many problems of imperfect markets, but some people refuse to accept that markets aren't always perfect, and that leads to deep misunderstandings and bad policy.\n\nCapitalism can be a tool to serve society, or society can be a tool to serve capitalism.",

Communism takes that and changes from the \"worker\" to the \"government\"... Chinese infrastructure is ALL owned by the government. Chinese economy is FULLY controlled by the government.
