My average price was near ATH for a while but I've been slowly DCAing the average buy price down now I'm at like 40k I think and it's continually going down. But regardless of that I'm not upset because I'm thinking long term and BTC is at some point going back up and beyond ATH so I'm happy. It's way too easy when you have hindsight to complain.\n\nAlso, BTC was invented to replace the Fiat system not as an investment to get rich. Keep that in mind.

Maybe, for the utility it provides, it's not worth what you're still paying for it. Be careful, remember that your blind warm belief is someone else's cold hard profit.\n\nWhat you can do is reduce your exposure: diversify, and not into shitcoin, but in other uncorrelated assets (buy Euros, tobacco stocks, some gold exposure and a mortgage for a flat in Canada, or whatever completely isolated asset) so your mind is not ENTIRELY spinning around your mistake but can stroll around a variety of ups and down. I do that, and there's always something green, plus, you can rebalance.\n\nRebalancing, which only works if you're diversified enough, allows you to sell when one asset becomes outsized in your portfolio to buy an undersized asset. For myself I have stocks in all continents: sometimes the US stocks, which I want at 30% of my stock investment, become 35% because they grow too high in value: I sell and buy Chinese stocks, dumping because Jack Ma blurted an insult. Then the month after, it's the opposite. I sell when too high, buy when too low, stay at the same relative size but the pie grows.\n\nDo not consider bitcoin as a religion, an ideology, a goal for the world, a revolution or a technology. It's a way to make a buck for when you retire and can't work at McDonald's anymore.",

You invested in an asset class that has huge upside potential over the next 10-20 years. Your $40k BTC will 5-10X and you'll be happy with your portfolio. Just hodl a ride out the cycles.",
