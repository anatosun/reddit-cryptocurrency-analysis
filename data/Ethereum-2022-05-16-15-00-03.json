Far more complex systems and applications have been developed in a fraction of the time it is taking Ethereum developers to do whatever it is they are supposed to be doing.\n\nWhere is the accountability?

And you have to implement self-regulated mechanisms that allow for the different users to have aligned incentives, notably in terms of profitability. At all times, being malevolent must be unprofitable. \n\nAnd all that without any bug, of course. Let's just say that it's quite rare to see actually good devs, ones who value the activity of testing and who know that coding architecture has nothing to do with an \"architect\" telling you which lib to use, devs who know how to follow the SOLID principles.",

Not like the FED is just going to sit on it than just release something magically one day when they are claiming years out if they do one at all. \n\nI'm more concerned about how China and India banned other crypto once they dropped their own CBDC and how the U.S. will almost follow identical suit. A CBDC by the U.S. could be the deathnail to crypto. \n\nWasn't that long ago the dollar was under attack and they stole everyone's physical gold. Would have to be pretty delusional their endgoal is to incorporate.
