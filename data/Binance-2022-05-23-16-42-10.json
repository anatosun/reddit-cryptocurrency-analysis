Am I the only one that is unaware of how to use this voucher and receive the cashback?\n\nThe details of how to use it aren't helpful at all.\n\nIf someone is able to run me through it like a child that would be much appreciated!",

The cashback will be distributed to the user's spot account in USDT the following day of the user's trading.The maximum cashback amount of one user equals the face value of this voucher, which will be deducted each day according to the cashback distribution until depletion or the expiry of the cashback reward time.\n\n2.The voucher is valid until: xxxx. Reward time:14 days.\n\nActivation:\n\n1. Activate the Cashback Voucher in Reward Center.\n2. The cashback equals to the trading fee of the Spot each day will be distributed to your spot account in USDT the following day of your trading.\n3. You may visit Wallet - Transaction History - Distribution or click \u201cDetail\u201d on the voucher for more information on the cashback distribution history each day.\n4. If you activate multiple Cashback Vouchers at the same time, the vouchers will be deducted according to the order of redemption (first redemption, first burn). In addition to the expiry date of the redemption of the cashback voucher, you will also be subject to the cashback reward time, where you will not be able to apply or use the remaining balance of the cashback vouchers in any way once it has expired.",
