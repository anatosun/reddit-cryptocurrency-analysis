He is polished, articulate and well educated. Just think if just half of those 44 countries adopt bitcoin as a legal tender, the amount of bitcoin being purchased not only by their central banks but by the 100s of millions of people in those countries that may be exposed to bitcoin for the first time would be unprecedented!!",

Without going to much into the details, there is a type of service being provided by one party for a general user that should be able to pay for the provided service, within the app.\n\nUsers need to be able to top up their account, pay for the service and withdraw from the app (those, who get paid for the service provided).\n\nOne of the ways would be to simply implement google/apple native pay interface (fiat world) but I was wondering... would it be possible to integrate payments in sats within the user base of the app? In such case, where should I start?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks a ton!",
