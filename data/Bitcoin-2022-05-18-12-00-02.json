Instead, services connected to their businesses were breached. With trezor mail chimp was breached exposing email addresses. Ledger e-commerce database got hacked due to careless opsec. Neither had jeapordized funds of users. \n\nBoth though supplied enough info for at least all of its users to be flagged as crypto holders. Which sucks, but not devastating for most users.",

Trezor is open source, which is cool, but you have to have your Trezor plugged in and activated to pull up the app on the computer and see your balance...I don't like that.  With the Ledger, you can pull the Ledger Live app up without your wallet connected and check your balance, the price of Bitcoin, and you can even pull a receive addy without your wallet.  So I like to use Ledger day-by-day.  But I trust Trezor a bit more, as it's open source.  \n\nDid have one issue with Ledger Live app, just once.  I withdrew some BTC from my sports betting account, and it suddenly displayed some crazy stupid balance in my wallet, which I knew wasn't accurate.  I cleared the cache and re-synced it, and it then displayed the correct balance and worked properly.  Otherwise it's been perfect.  I like it.",

It was Ledger\u2019s customer database that was breached which included names, emails, phone numbers and home addresses after the attacker found a vulnerability with one of their poorly coded API\u2019s. This information got dumped in plain text on to the internet.\n\nAttackers have been using this information to attempt email and phone phishing, as well as mail and even tampered hardware scams.\n\nLedger devices are not necessarily less secure. The issue is that their firmware is closed source - meaning that although their code is not readily available for black hat hackers to tinker with, it also cannot be reproduced to verify that there are no back doors or other vulnerabilities, so there\u2019s a level of trust needed which many Bitcoiners who appreciate OPSEC are not willing to compromise on.\n\nThe Trezor isn\u2019t perfect either. There is a known physical attack vector targeting the STM32 microcontroller. Trezor have offered solutions - increased pin length to improve entropy on seed data which is stored (encrypted) in flash memory to limit the risk of a brute force attempt, or alternatively - the use of the 25th word passphrase which is not stored in memory. So if you aren\u2019t already I would recommend at least using a passphrase for that added layer of protection. Although the risk of physical access attacks occurring would be low in my mind, it\u2019s not zero. \n\nhttps://walletscrutiny.com/ is a great tool for comparing wallets and their transparency around security.",
