            "selftext": "Man, this is so frustrating. \nCase #11988313. \n\nPayment failed because it tried grabbing from checkings instead of savings. I get an email. No problem, I'll just transfer enough funds to cover.\n\nHowever, coinbase app asks me to relink bank. I try, and it says the account already exists/has been linked. Reached out to customer service and jumped through all the loops. Note: Bank #1 did not receive a withdrawal/deposit request from coinbase for this transaction. Bank #1 also has an iffy history with crypto policies.\n\nSo I try to add bank #2. Says bank can't be added through instant verification nor manual. Also getting error saying this account has been added before (it has, but I unlinked months ago). Note: Bank #2 accepts cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nTried adding paypal and a debit card. Both do NOT show up in the \"Make payment\" (edit: dropdown menu) that appears on alert modal. \n\nRunning out of ideas. Tried adding bank #3 - cashapp. Now I get an error saying I've made too many bank verification  attempts. Try again in 7 days. \n\nAutomatic recovery happens tomorrow. I'll lose my portfolio. \n\nCan anyone from Coinbase help? \nThis is extremely stressful and has been a terrible experience.\n\nCase #11988313.",
