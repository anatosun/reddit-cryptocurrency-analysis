I think we'd get a few hundred warning signals before CB ran out of coins.\n\nWhat's interesting to me here is that the LRC community is using this to move users onto private keys in an EXTREMELY powerful way. \n\nClearly people shouldn't screenshot their Electron-Cash balances or Monero wallet, but the zeroing out on CEXs and meming it has an element that *Bring Them Home* and Monerun did not. \n\nI think this could meme could see widespread adoption in many communities of over-shorted crypto assets.",
