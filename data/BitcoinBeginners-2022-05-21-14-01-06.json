I think I accidentally told one of my friends my recovery code (I know I'm stupid) and now I'm very paranoid. \n\nI want to switch from Coinbase to Blockstream Green wallet and I'm thinking just to be on the safe side I'll make a new wallet as well while I'm at it.\n\nSo my question is - Will there be any fees when sending BTC from one wallet to another? If yes, how much approx? \n\nIs there any other way I can sort this out?\n\nThanks.",

If this is the case those private keys are compromised and you need to setup a new wallet with new backup words and than send the btc to a new wallet with an onchain transaction and stop using the old wallet \n\n>Will there be any fees when sending BTC from one wallet to another? If yes, how much approx? \n\nYes, the mempool is clear now so set the lowest priority fee (1-2 sat a byte is fine \n\n1 sat a byte would mean a fee of 4-10 cents to send the bitcoin \n\nhttps://twitter.com/CoreFeeHelper\n\nThis a a fee scraper that shows the average fees per fee rate",
