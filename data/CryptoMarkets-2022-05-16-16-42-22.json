Nigeria issued new rules to clarify crypto\u2019s role in the economy and stated all digital assets to be securities, while the UK has plans to support crypto adoption and create more powers to seize and recover digital assets.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Companies follow suit: the leading flag carrier of the United Arab Emirates, Emirates Airline, is all set to dive into the digital asset space by leveraging cryptocurrencies, NFTs and the metaverse in order to connect with customers in a faster and more flexible way.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Algorithmic stablecoin UST crashed the market this week. Luna Foundation Guard has sold around 80k worth of BTC as well as other assets and now is looking to use its remaining assets to compensate remaining users of UST, starting with the smallest holders.\n\nHave a nice week!",
