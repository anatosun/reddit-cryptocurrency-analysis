I pay way more with other cryptos, and i never cared enough to check the difference. is BIG.\n\n\\- Coin, not a token. Since i am a newbie in Doge story, i always thinked that was like an ethereum token, just like Shib (FEES, ouch). Registered on binance, i noticed in address \"Dogecoin\", and i was like \"is a bug or what?\", truth is, that dogecoin have HIS OWN chain, a freaking \"meme\" coin, have a chain for itself. WHAT!?!\n\n\\- Community, except the \"when lambo\" \"when moon\" posts, is more friendly and not depressing like other cryptos. you lost 500$ on this crypto? HODL, memes, moon soon etc. in another crypto sub?, depression, rage, \"i quit\" posts etc. Is a big difference.\n\n\\- Real use on Internet Donations and tipping. I am a BAT user, and i mostly use BAT to tip content creators, and i was thinking this thing was innovative... turns out, Dogecoin did this WAY BEFORE (What in the actual Quack), even if for now is only on reddit (checked and registered with sodogetip). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHOW MANY MORE THINGS I MISSED OUT?, i feel like an uga buga neanderthal man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for making me discovering this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-A Fellow BAT user.",

How fast and secure doge is. \n\nIt's the only coin that I know of that has deflationary inflation. The reward blocks are static, so the more coins in existence the lower the inflation rate becomes. \n\nThe static rewards incentivises miners to mine, so we don't have to add a bunch of arbitrary fees to make the chain go. This leads to a much more democratic blockchain with FIFO being the default for transactions rather than \"highest paid fee goes first\".\n\nSo money. Much wow!",

They have about 100 years to change their mind on that and become like doge. \n\nIf you do understand math, then do the math... Calculate how many new coins will be created each year and compare it to the historic USD-Inflation to figure out why doge will always increase in price over the USD that devalues itself much faster...\n\n\"unlimited supply is a problem\" is a meme by haters that don't understand math.

Not sure I\u2019m not a LUNA expert.  Dogecoin has no theoretical upper bound.  However it is issued by the algorithm over a long period of time. This will produce deflationary action in its price over time at a consistent rate. THIS IS A GOOD THING.  It means it\u2019s stable money.
