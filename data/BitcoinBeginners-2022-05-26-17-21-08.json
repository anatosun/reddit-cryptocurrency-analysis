                    "response": "> and moving currencies between hot and cold wallets.\n\nMoving the bitcoin has nothing to do with taxes. You just export out the CSV from the exchange of when you purchased and compare when you sold and do a FIFO in most cases \n\nFor the US, if you sell, trade for another asset, or spend it becomes a taxable event. One reason, of many, why day trading is a nightmare. \n**Yes, Every single trade on an exchange is a taxable event!**\n\nNow this has several implications. Day trading becomes tax nightmare because every transaction is a taxable event. So someone that daytrades or invests in altcoins may be forced to use specialized software or hire an accountant for thousands of dollars and someone that just makes an occasional purchase of Bitcoin and withdraws it has a much easier task of calculated any taxes especially if they don't make large purchases giving them an excuse to simply not report. Not the same if you are daytrading on exchanges , especially if you have made over 200 trades in a year.\n\nAlso there is a distinction between short term and long term capital gains taxes so its much wiser to not sell your BTC for at least 1 year so at worst you have to pay the much lower long term capital gains -\n\nLook at this chart -\n\nhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2021-capital-gains-tax-rates-and-how-to-minimize-t/\nTL;DR - most people will need to pay 15% in the USA for selling BTC after a year.\n\n**Buy Bitcoin , record the price you bought it for and the date in a spreadsheet and wait at least 1 year before selling it or taking profits so if you do decide to pay taxes on profits you are at least in the lower tax category of long term capital gains.**\n\nMany people do not pay taxes when they spend BTC or sell it in person for cash but if you sell on any exchange like coinbase in the future , buy a car, boat, atv, house , land with Bitcoin , you better pay your taxes\n\nExamples - \n\n**Example 1 legal**: Say you bought 10 BTC for 1k USD each and want to sell them over a year later. Those BTC are now worth 10k each so you have a realized profit of 90k USD, thus your taxable income is now 90k if you have no other income. This would means you are in the 15% tax bracket thus are subject to 13,500 USD in taxes on the profit - deductions and writeoffs. So lets say with your writeoffs and deductions you now have to pay 6.5k in taxes , leaving you with 83,500 USD to put a down payment on a home.\n\n**Example 2 legal** - You have 10 BTC purchased or mined at 1k each when you received them. This is now worth 100k USD. You wait a year to sell them and never sell more than the amount where your total income exceeds 39,375 usd per year and than file your taxes where you pay none due to being in the first capital gains bracket **if you have no other sources of income as you state** . This will take several years or much longer(as btc continues to appreciate) to slowly sell off your bitcoin\n\n\n**Example 3 technically illegal**  - You have 10 BTC purchased or mined at 1k each when you received them. This is now worth 100k USD. You decide to use your reported income from your occupation to buy a home and keep the BTC spending separate on other items. You slowly spend your BTC on amazon, plane trips, hotels, selling small amounts in person or in atms without ID , restaurants in a private manner(personal wallet that you control private keys and you have done the minimum to wash the BTC). Technically you need to report taxes on every tx , but since you are not day trading the exchange you bought the BTC from does not report you and it is unenforceable for the IRS to even know you are spending those BTC. Since you are not buying large items registered to your identity you are also not targeted as well.\n\nHere are other ways people avoid taxes -\n\nspend btc directly for non registered items \u2013technically illegal if you don\u2019t pay taxes but difficult to enforce\n\nsell at 2 way atms without ID (coinatmradar.com) \u2013technically illegal if you don\u2019t pay taxes but difficult to enforce\n\n\nsell p2p with others\u2013technically illegal if you don\u2019t pay taxes but difficult to enforce\n\n\nsell on a DEX like BISQ\u2013technically illegal if you don\u2019t pay taxes but difficult to enforce\n\n\nSell the minimum in a country like the USA where you can get in the 0% long term cap gains rate - legal\n\nKeep the btc as collateral and take on debt that is not taxable - legal\n\nGift bitcoin with a gift tax exemption - legal\n\nDonate bitcoin to charities - legal\n\n\nFor countries like the USA you can use any accounting method as long as you are consistent\n\nIf you were to use FIFO(first in , first out) it would look like this\n\nBuy 1- 0.12 BTC @ 1000 USD\n\nBuy 2 - 0.5 BTC @ 3540 USD\n\nBuy 3 - 0.025 @ 4512 USD\n\nBuy 4 - 0.0054 @ 8004 USD\n\nSay you decide to sell 0.5 BTC for fiat(USD) when Bitcoin is valued at 40k usd\nThis would mean you would take your first in 2 purchases\n\n0.12x40k = 4,800 usd in value - 120 initial purchase price = 4680 in profit\n\n0.38 btc x 40k = 15,200 - original purchase rate of 0.38 (1345.2) = 13,854.2 profit\n\nTotal taxable profit = 18,534.8 usd\n\nIf its over a year , you are looking at the lower long term cap gains ... most people this would be 15% so you pay 2,780.22 usd in taxes if you decide to pay them\nIf under a year you will have the much higher ordinary tax rate (22-40% for most people)",
