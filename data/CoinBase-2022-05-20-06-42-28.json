Needless to say, I am pretty new and ignorant to this so there are many things I\u2019m still figuring out; including the general workings of the app and the interface. \n\nI have invested some of my local currency (GBP) into Eutherium which I can see listed on my assets screen, but underneath them I can also see Euros listed as \u20ac0. \n\nAs my currency is set to GBP and I haven\u2019t got any existing assets in Euro, I\u2019m wondering why this is on my list at all? Is there anything I can do to take it off so that I\u2019m not looking at an empty listing?\n\nThanks!",
