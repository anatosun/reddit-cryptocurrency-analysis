            "selftext": "$20 I was just charged for my Ethereum purchase. I mean how greedy can Coinbase get? I have a little over 1 Ethereum staked with Coinbase and I fuqing regret it! I mean the biggest mistake ever. Here I am trying to take make a little extra cash, so I figured I'd buy the \"dip\" , big mistake! Coinbase just robbed me for $20. They won't unstake my Ethereum so I can stake it elsewhere. I'm done with them. As soon as eth2 launches or whatever the hell it is we are waiting for, I'm switching to a different platform. \nBinance and kraken are the best platforms from what I hear. \nCoinbase, you will not get another penny from me, except from the staked Ethereum rewards that you're bleeding me dry for.",

BinanceUS is a far better and cheaper platform, greater selection of coins and makes it easier for US customers to invest in BEP-2 or BEP-20 coins. I don't care about the staked ETH, I knew the deal when I staked it, it's the high fees, the amount of unsupported coins (even ERC-20) is ridiculous and the customer service is horrendous. There are far better options out there (cheaper too).",
