The popup says to click  on the bottom line to CONFIRM enrollment. Even if a person does not  click the bottom line, it enrolls the person which requires injecting  money from 50,000 USDT to 200,000 USDT. I have complained to customer  relations that I never clicked on the bottom CONFIRM line, but they  insist that I clicked on it. They have locked in all my funds and I am  not able to get out of it. Any solutions? I need help with this one.",
