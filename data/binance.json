I am not a pattern trader and I don't trade the 15min chart but if you believe that this is a bull flag and you want to take a long position based on it then you can not expect this single signal to play out for hours. Again I don't trade based on patterns and neither do I trade break outs but if I would then my long would have looked like this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/YLFHzHt1/ \ntarget the high of day and take profits quick. The market environment is extremely bearish at the moment so I only try to sell pumps at the moment but if you want to take long trades then make sure to manage your risk. Also there is so much more to look at then just single patterns like that, find some confluence before you make a decision.",

But then Russia, being desperate, might cut a really good deal to buyers in btc on the bet that btc appreciates? The USD equivalent discount in concurrent BTC price might be attractive enough to go that route for buyers. None of this taking regulatory obstacles into acct. Thoughts?\n\nEdit: This also depends on whether there is even remotely enough liquidity in BTC to support that level of transaction volume. Signs point to no? but I haven't done my homework.",

Besides that, here are some things worth noting.  \n  \n1. Always do a test transaction, regardless of how sure you are (or how much of a rush you are in).  \n2. Metamask (and other wallets) don't always show the exact correct token symbol; check your transaction hashes to see what the actual tokens are.  \n3. Some tokens can have the exact same symbol, when they are in fact different tokens. Again, check your transaction hashes.  \n4. You swapped ETH via UniswapV3 for Wormhole BNB i.e. BNB which is wrapped by the Wormhole protocol.  \n5. Wormhole BNB, despite the abbreviation of WBNB, is different to the Wrapped BNB (also WBNB) found on the Binance Smart Chain.  \n6. BNB doesn't exist on the Ethereum Blockchain, and as such, any version of it you have on Ethereum will be some kind of wrapped BNB.  \n  \nIt looks like you have tried to swap the wrong kind of wrapped BNB vs. what was expected by the contract you interacted with. Theoretically, it is possible for Binance to remedy this. I would be as persistent as you can be. Typically with the Binance live chat, you will be transferred to members of whichever team they deem the most fit to help you resolve your issue. If it isn't resolved by a particular team, try to get transferred to a different team the next time, perhaps by framing your problem differently, or just asking for specialists in one area to help with a complex issue.  \n  \nGood luck pal.",

If there are assets you are just holding for the long term, I would look at other wallet options (soft/hard wallets etc) and move your long term holdings to a wallet which ypu have control over. \n\nThe only thing I can liken Binance to is kind of like renting/leasing a property over owning your own. While you can live in a rented property and for all intent and purposes it is \"your\" home, you ultimately do not have control over it and you are to some degree at the whim of the landlord. If the landlord decides to raise rent, change your contract terms, ask you to vacate the property etc, you have no options really, other than to comply. \n\nI am sure there are better analogies, but you catch my drift I am sure.",

Research the exchange history for hacks to see the likelihood of yours getting swiped off the exchange, but good exchanges will compensate their customers and the chances of this happening can be relatively small on most bigger exchanges. Wallets can be compromised too, so know your different wallet types and dangers there like dusting attacks, scam contracts interacting with your wallet, scam NFTs or losing phrase keys for cold wallets and your crypto forever. Everything has its own risk. \n\nKnow that the exchange will charge you part of the crypto you're trying to transfer as a fee, but once outside the exchange you will have to pay in the native blockchain for transferring. For example, the exchange may charge you 300,000 shiba-inu to transfer 100,000,000, but once it's in your wallet you now have to pay Etherium (look up current gas prices OMG!!!) to transfer anywhere else or back onto the exchange...this gets soooo many people who didn't research this beforehand and can't afford the Etherium to move it back out of their wallet.\n\nLearn as much as you can and research before doing anything related to your crypto, or your mistakes will cost you money almost every time. Most of us learned from some mistakes at the cost of our money, hopefully you get spared from that as much as possible.",

If Bitcoin moves sharply beyond both options\u2019 combined breakeven price, you can exit the trade profitably.

Besides that, here are some things worth noting.  \n  \n1. Always do a test transaction, regardless of how sure you are (or how much of a rush you are in).  \n2. Metamask (and other wallets) don't always show the exact correct token symbol; check your transaction hashes to see what the actual tokens are.  \n3. Some tokens can have the exact same symbol, when they are in fact different tokens. Again, check your transaction hashes.  \n4. You swapped ETH via UniswapV3 for Wormhole BNB i.e. BNB which is wrapped by the Wormhole protocol.  \n5. Wormhole BNB, despite the abbreviation of WBNB, is different to the Wrapped BNB (also WBNB) found on the Binance Smart Chain.  \n6. BNB doesn't exist on the Ethereum Blockchain, and as such, any version of it you have on Ethereum will be some kind of wrapped BNB.  \n  \nIt looks like you have tried to swap the wrong kind of wrapped BNB vs. what was expected by the contract you interacted with. Theoretically, it is possible for Binance to remedy this. I would be as persistent as you can be. Typically with the Binance live chat, you will be transferred to members of whichever team they deem the most fit to help you resolve your issue. If it isn't resolved by a particular team, try to get transferred to a different team the next time, perhaps by framing your problem differently, or just asking for specialists in one area to help with a complex issue.  \n  \nGood luck pal.",
