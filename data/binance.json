I am not a pattern trader and I don't trade the 15min chart but if you believe that this is a bull flag and you want to take a long position based on it then you can not expect this single signal to play out for hours. Again I don't trade based on patterns and neither do I trade break outs but if I would then my long would have looked like this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/YLFHzHt1/ \ntarget the high of day and take profits quick. The market environment is extremely bearish at the moment so I only try to sell pumps at the moment but if you want to take long trades then make sure to manage your risk. Also there is so much more to look at then just single patterns like that, find some confluence before you make a decision.",

But then Russia, being desperate, might cut a really good deal to buyers in btc on the bet that btc appreciates? The USD equivalent discount in concurrent BTC price might be attractive enough to go that route for buyers. None of this taking regulatory obstacles into acct. Thoughts?\n\nEdit: This also depends on whether there is even remotely enough liquidity in BTC to support that level of transaction volume. Signs point to no? but I haven't done my homework.",

Finding the right number for N is like picking the winning Powerball numbers.\n\nThe sober reality is this is a battle of bots. The winner will be someone with very low latency and a bot that estimates the latency accurately.\n\n**Edit:** I suppose you could find the actual server your browser connects to and run some ping tests to estimate latency. However, you would still be unlikely to win given all the other bots.",

Besides that, here are some things worth noting.  \n  \n1. Always do a test transaction, regardless of how sure you are (or how much of a rush you are in).  \n2. Metamask (and other wallets) don't always show the exact correct token symbol; check your transaction hashes to see what the actual tokens are.  \n3. Some tokens can have the exact same symbol, when they are in fact different tokens. Again, check your transaction hashes.  \n4. You swapped ETH via UniswapV3 for Wormhole BNB i.e. BNB which is wrapped by the Wormhole protocol.  \n5. Wormhole BNB, despite the abbreviation of WBNB, is different to the Wrapped BNB (also WBNB) found on the Binance Smart Chain.  \n6. BNB doesn't exist on the Ethereum Blockchain, and as such, any version of it you have on Ethereum will be some kind of wrapped BNB.  \n  \nIt looks like you have tried to swap the wrong kind of wrapped BNB vs. what was expected by the contract you interacted with. Theoretically, it is possible for Binance to remedy this. I would be as persistent as you can be. Typically with the Binance live chat, you will be transferred to members of whichever team they deem the most fit to help you resolve your issue. If it isn't resolved by a particular team, try to get transferred to a different team the next time, perhaps by framing your problem differently, or just asking for specialists in one area to help with a complex issue.  \n  \nGood luck pal.",

Do you think that every new token traded only via liquidity pools is ponzi by definition? \n\nI mean at first people give BNB to the liquidity pool to get the token (aka shitcoin) and then they sell the token to get the BNB back. People need to fill the LP with BNBs first (often the shitcoin creators give something ridiculous like 1 BNB only to the LP pair) and then those who sell first get the most money back paid from other peoples money. Those who do not sell in time are the bag holders.\n\n99% of shitcoins are super short lived pump and dumps. 1) Create token 2) Buy it for super cheap 3) Convince someone to buy it for more 4) Dump on him 5) No one is gonna buy it anymore and the coin is over. 6) You can create new token and repeat",

If on landing platforms, buy them there. I use Nexo and I get more crypto for my money than on Kraken or Coinbase. But worth checking Blockify and Celsius too.\n\nIf you go for stakable tokens, compare t platforms buy and withdrawal fees. You will be surprised how big differences there are.\n\nGo with standard, BTC + ETH. At least at the beginning. Keep learning and once you are confident in a project, you might want add that. I would check out ADA, ALGO and LINK",

Staking is one good example.\n\n3) You should consider mining as well even if it's just a cloud mining.\n\n4) Layer 1 seems to me to be more relevant for long term hold compared to project built on it.\n\n5) Other than Bitcoin and several others, smart contract might be the way to go in the future.\n\n6) Be aware of the constantly changing demand of the market. First it was a P2P payment like Bitcoin and then smart contract like Eth. After that defi, NFT and gaming. \n\nThese are my humble opinions.

What is their roadmap? Etc. those matters a lot to me.\n\nTake holoride for example, they have partnered with Audi motors while gamestar has partnered with Sony, Marvel and Disney and were able to obtain IP rights of Jeopardy and family feud.\n\nSo that's why I think DYOR might not be as complicated as people think.

You either hodl your cryptos, stake them or invest in them. If you\u2019re looking for cryptos with high APYs, then I\u2019d advise you to keep an eye on new projects. Their volatility makes buying them too risky, so developers present an excessively high amount of APY to compensate.

There is a saying in this space and that is:\n\nIf they aren't your keys, then it isn't your crypto. \n\nMaking reference to the holder of the public and private keys to your wallets, which in the case of Binsnce Hot Wallets, is binance. \n\nBinance is a good CEX to use as a trading platform if you are trading assets regularly. If there are assets you are just holding for the long term, I would look at other wallet options (soft/hard wallets etc) and move your long term holdings to a wallet which ypu have control over. \n\nThe only thing I can liken Binance to is kind of like renting/leasing a property over owning your own. While you can live in a rented property and for all intent and purposes it is \"your\" home, you ultimately do not have control over it and you are to some degree at the whim of the landlord. If the landlord decides to raise rent, change your contract terms, ask you to vacate the property etc, you have no options really, other than to comply. \n\nI am sure there are better analogies, but you catch my drift I am sure.",

                    "response": "No, it's your choice to keep on an exchange or move to a wallet. You own it either way. Research the exchange history for hacks to see the likelihood of yours getting swiped off the exchange, but good exchanges will compensate their customers and the chances of this happening can be relatively small on most bigger exchanges. Wallets can be compromised too, so know your different wallet types and dangers there like dusting attacks, scam contracts interacting with your wallet, scam NFTs or losing phrase keys for cold wallets and your crypto forever. Everything has its own risk. \n\nKnow that the exchange will charge you part of the crypto you're trying to transfer as a fee, but once outside the exchange you will have to pay in the native blockchain for transferring. For example, the exchange may charge you 300,000 shiba-inu to transfer 100,000,000, but once it's in your wallet you now have to pay Etherium (look up current gas prices OMG!!!) to transfer anywhere else or back onto the exchange...this gets soooo many people who didn't research this beforehand and can't afford the Etherium to move it back out of their wallet.\n\nLearn as much as you can and research before doing anything related to your crypto, or your mistakes will cost you money almost every time. Most of us learned from some mistakes at the cost of our money, hopefully you get spared from that as much as possible.",

Do you think that every new token traded only via liquidity pools is ponzi by definition? \n\nI mean at first people give BNB to the liquidity pool to get the token (aka shitcoin) and then they sell the token to get the BNB back. People need to fill the LP with BNBs first (often the shitcoin creators give something ridiculous like 1 BNB only to the LP pair) and then those who sell first get the most money back paid from other peoples money. Those who do not sell in time are the bag holders.\n\n99% of shitcoins are super short lived pump and dumps. 1) Create token 2) Buy it for super cheap 3) Convince someone to buy it for more 4) Dump on him 5) No one is gonna buy it anymore and the coin is over. 6) You can create new token and repeat",

For as long as you safeguard your passphrase, maintain 2FA, add whitelist addresses for withdrawl you should be ok. My personal preference is to keep some portion of my portfolio on Binance, some in my cold wallet, some in crypto banks. Verdict - probability of losing money is fairly slim.",

On the other hand with isolated margin there is a separate collateral per trading pair. In both cases, it is only what is in your margin account that is at risk, not your spot.\n\nhttps://www.binance.com/en/blog/all/binance-margin-differences-between-the-new-isolated-margin-mode-and-cross-margin-mode-421499824684900602",

If you use Isolated, only your margin will be liquidated.\n\nSimply, In Cross mode  you use your account balance as the margin for all the positions you open. So all cross postions share your wallet balance. \nIn Isolated mode you isolate each position. (You can add or remove funds to the margin).\n\nFriendly Advice here , Do not use high leverage, I mean even 10X is risky without proper risk management (knowing you are a beginner). Do not let the fund get liquidated. Use Stop Loss. With cryptos' volatility we don't know what happens next. Look at the recent crash.\n\nFutures aren't a bad thing. If you use leverage wisely you will be profitable. Manage the Risk, you will get the reward. \nGood Luck.",

They are required to keep capital reserves on hand for traditional markets.... but this is only checked on a snap shot basis. So they can deploy capital reserves to an unregulated market with zero oversight, pillage and pull the funds back out so they are there for next regulatory snap shot of capital reserves. \n\n>But you asking yourself why would these shorts effect price so much?. They don't themselves but in combination with spot leveraged trading and USDT backed printed reserves. They create fictitious BTC balances in their users accounts \n\nSort of correct.... but not quiet. \n\nFutures contracts are..... PAPER CONTRACTS! You dont own the underlying asset when you buy/sell BTC futures, you are buying EXPOSURE to the underlying assets price movements and nothing more. \n\nThe flip side of this is that there can exist 10x, 100x, 1000x times more BTC futures then just the 21 million BTC..... This means the futures contract captures the price discovery mechanism of BTC and can be used to artificially manipulate the underlying asset! This is and has been the MAJOR problem with physical gold/silver markets for decades! \n\nUSDT just further compounds the huge problem that BTC futures is! \n\n\nLiterally the ONLY people getting liquidated in these crashes/dips are those who are leverage trading futures! They NEVER owned the underlying asset as they were trading futures contracts and only had exposure to price movements!",

You can 'withdraw' your crypto from binance and stash it on your own hardware wallet at home.\n\nWhere people get into a bother on this, is that historically, banks are more regulated, have a longer stable history, and are therefore 'safer' than the crypto equivalents like binance. Add in that the online crypto exchanges have all been hacked once or more, that we know of, and crypto purists will tell you that it's safer at the moment, to stash your crypto on your own hardware device.\n\nOf course, we've all seen the news stories of the 'potential millionaire' trawling through the local garbage tip, looking for the bitcoin hard drive that they accidentally discarded. So, it's not an entirely risk free proposition either.",

I gave them hell on their support chat and especially [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tbirand/status/1456330000831942662), they got it resolved in 5 minutes. So my advice; give them hell on social media and their chat otherwise no dice. What a shameful way to conduct business Binance! \n\nNeedless to say, I'll be withdrawing everything and be gone with the wind.
