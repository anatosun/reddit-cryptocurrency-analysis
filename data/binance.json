I usually spend \u00a310 here and there on XRP and nothing else. Fuck Binance I'm going to start using a quality exchange if I can find one. Also if you are a Binance user if you don't want to be unable to withdraw from the 11th of this month then please undergo the verification process again because if you do not then you will lose the ability to withdraw your own cryptocurrencies. So either verify, move your funds to a new exchange or lose your hard earned crypto to greedy Binance. It is a terrible state of affairs. Fuck Binance.",

The Terra ecosystem, which is currently among the most valued top ten cryptocurrency projects in the market, has closed a year of development by becoming the largest decentralized stablecoin.\n\n\nUST, one of the stablecoins produced from the Terra project, has overtaken DAI, another decentralized stablecoin, as the most valued project of its kind by market valuation. This concludes a year of progress for the Terra ecosystem and UST, which saw its market value rise from $182 million at the start of 2021 to $9 billion in December.\n\n\nEven though these function by putting up collateral to support the tokens on the market, UST is an algorithmic stablecoin that leverages another Terra ecosystem token (LUNA) to balance its peg against the US dollar value.\n\n\nOther decentralized stable coins' market capitalization has increased in the previous 30 days. These decentralized coins don't require a centralized point of issue and can't be halted by a central authority. UST is now the fourth most valuable stablecoin, trailing only USDT, USDC, and BUSD, which are all centralized stablecoins.\n\n\nBecause of the increased attention that stablecoins like USDT and USDC are receiving from authorities, some feel that these alternative stablecoins will continue to grow in popularity, with people flocking to these alternatives for various reasons. Despite this, USDT remains the most popular stablecoin on exchanges, with over $68 billion worth of the currency changing hands yesterday.\n\n\nThe price of UST has risen to ATH levels, as has the price of LUNA, its sibling token. Many projects like Deedy can benefit from this in their digital transformation consulting can aid you to acquire productivity gains, effectiveness, and consciousness.",

            "text": "Bitcoin has just entered another major price zone. Which usually means the end of the 'bear phase', data confirms. The Dynamic range (NA) is returning to levels seen only twice in two years, namely during the corona crash in March 2020 and last year when the Chinese mining sector was shut down. In a tweet on Jan. 24, Charles Edwards, founder of crypto investment firm Capriole, showed the \"network value to transaction\" as it sends out a rare \"oversold\" signal. The Bitcoin price just keeps crashing. Also today. The BTC rate is now not far from the psychological $30,000 barrier. If this is broken, it can become very painful for crypto investors. By the way, it is not only the crypto market that is suffering huge losses. The stock market is also turning dark red today. The AEX index has already fallen almost 3% today and the NASDAQ also seems ready for a huge loss today. Still, there are plenty of reasons for on-chain analysts to believe the magnitude of the losses is more of a market overreaction than a taste of things to come. That statement is supported by NVT, which calculates how oversold Bitcoin really is. First developed by statistician Willy Woo and entrepreneur Dmitry Kalichkin, the NVT uses the ratio between Bitcoin's market cap and daily transaction value to get an idea of \u200b\u200bwhether price behavior really corresponds to on-chain activity. Edwards then adjusted the statistic by adding standard deviation bands to account for natural changes in behavior in the chain as Bitcoin matures. The result was it so-called \u201cdynamic range N/A\u201d, and it is this metric that returned to its green zone this week. In the past two years, this statistic has only turned green in the summer of 2021, the period of China's mining, and during the coronavirus crash of March 2020. So now it is again. Right now i am bullish on a few projects like: Rise up, Yunometa and Spores. Im very glad I've found them as wel as Earth and Atpay. DYOR!",

This is the 19th installment in Binance Chain's quarterly token burn program, which started in the third quarter of 2017. \n\nSince the debut of the Binance Chain and its native token, BNB, in 2017, the team has pledged to burn a total of 100 million BNB, or half of the total supply, to remove them from circulation. The Auto-Burn formula was used to automatically calculate the number of tokens removed for this quarter.\n\nBinance launched and implemented its first-ever auto-burn program, the BEP-95, in the fourth quarter of 2021, which calculates the number of BNB tokens to be burned using a formula based on the total number of blocks produced on the Binance Chain and BNB's average dollar-denominated price during the quarter.\n\nWhen cryptocurrency tokens or coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum or Nature Vault are purposefully and permanently removed from circulation, they are referred to as \"burned.\" The development team behind a cryptocurrency asset is usually in charge of token burning. It can be done in a number of methods, the most frequent of which is to send the coins to a so-called \"eater address,\" which has its current balance publicly viewable on the blockchain but no access to its contents. \n\nBurning may entail the project's developers purchasing tokens from the market or burning a portion of the supply currently accessible to them. Burning can be done with different goals in mind, but most often it is used for deflationary purposes: \n\nthe decrease in the circulating supply tends to drive an asset\u2019s price upward, incentivizing traders and investors to get involved. Another important use case for token burning is to maintain the price peg of stablecoins (cryptocurrencies whose value corresponds to another asset, like the U.S. dollar).",

Elrond tokens are defined by the Elrond Standard Digital Token (ESDT), which is the industry standard. The commencement of the new relationship will be marked by the introduction of Utrust's UTK coins on Binance.\n\nBinance has covered almost every aspect of DeFi finance and liquidity management. The platform has recently began to grow, and DeFi and TradFi entrepreneurs are being aggressively incorporated. As part of its objective to open up new areas in DeFi, the exchange executed an integration contract with Elrond to distribute the ESDT tokens. \n\nThe first token to take advantage of this opportunity is Utrust, an Elrond-based payment processor. The web3 startup, which began as an Ethereum ERC20 coin, has only lately migrated to the Elrond network. The move was prompted by high gas fees and slow blockchain transactions. After becoming an ESDT token, Utrust's UTK can now be deposited and withdrawn directly on Elrond.\n\nThe key benefit of this integration is that it reduces transaction costs and speeds up UTK transactions. Given 9f Elrond\u2019s advanced technology and infrastructure, it will be a realistic target for UTK. The payments company has published the UTK 2.0 economies upgrade, which will improve the UTK tokens\u2019 use.\nThis is intended to revolutionize the entire view of web3 payments and bring this industry to a wider variety of merchants due to the quickness and incentives. Elrond and Binance\u2019s integration comes at a good time for UTK, and it\u2019s expected to offer these visions a boost.\nAccording to Elrond, Binance will help sell the blockchain\u2019s native products to a wider audience. Elrond CEO Beniamin Mincu, noted that the startups on Elrond will have access to the largest marketplaces and deepest liquidity imaginable through Binance.\nIn a similar vein, Sanja Kon, CEO of Utrust, believes it will spur the development of their Merchant Yield product and play a vital part in the mainstreaming of web3 payments. Consequently, this integration will greatly improve the project\u2019s scalability.",

Changpeng Zhao, often known as \"CZ,\" the company's CEO, confirmed the news on Twitter in a series of messages.\n\n86 Binance accounts were mainly used to disburse the funds.\n\nAccording to a prior post from Cryptonary, Ronin Bridge, an Ethereum sidechain for Axie Infinity members, was actually hacked. And that results in a loss of around 173,600 ETH or $600 million and USDC 25.51 million or $25.5 million due to a security flaw. This is the largest DeFi hack so far, and it has established a precedent for future incidents like it. Zhao did not name the eighty-six accounts that might have been even implicated in the cybercrime. \n\nHowever, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation announced last week that hackers associated with the Lazarus Group. It is even believed that North Korea actually sponsors the group. As a result, the company was responsible for the loss of $621 million in bitcoin from Axie Infinity. Axie Infinity is basically a non-fungible token-based gameplay platform. It allows participants to earn in-game cash that can be actually exchanged for real money. \n\nIn early April, hackers attacked Axie Infinity's blockchain platform, Ronin Network. This platform permits users to transfer cryptocurrency in and out of gaming. You may utilize systems like Polygon, Point Network, Terra, and others for enhanced data security. \n\nIs North Korea to blame for the attack?\nThe North Korean hacker outfit Lazarus was actually revealed to be the true perpetrator of the Ronin Bridge breach. This was even stated in a previous article by Cryptonary. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the FBI suspects such breaches are a source of cash for North Korea's Kim Jong Un-led leadership. However, Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, is working to retrieve the stolen assets.",

BNB uses an auto-burn technique to reduce its total supply to 100,000,000 BNB. \n\nThe auto-burn mechanism adjusts the quantity of BNB to be burned based on the price of BNB and the number of blocks generated on the BNB Smart Chain throughout the quarter.

            "text": "The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed claims brought by U.S. residents trading on the Binance digital exchange on March 31, 2022, ruling that the plaintiffs' purchases of digital tokens were extraterritorial transactions that were not subject to federal or state securities laws in the United States. [1] This decision provides a lot more clarity for digital asset providers who are trying to figure out what the criteria are for claiming jurisdiction in the United States. It also lends credence to the idea that offshore corporations can gain access to US-based computer infrastructure without being subject to US jurisdiction. \n\nBecause Binance is a decentralized platform, the biggest of it's kind and home to several crypto like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Quint; the location of its principal place of business for jurisdictional purposes was a major point of contention in the case. Binance's location in Malta was only mentioned by the court.\n\nThe plaintiffs, all of whom are residents of the United States, began buying digital tokens on Binance in 2017. The tokens were first offered to investors in an initial coin offering (ICO) and then placed on Binance for secondary trading. Binance was paid a commission on each trade by the issuers in exchange for listing their tokens. \n\nInvestors were not informed that the tokens they were acquiring on Binance constituted securities under US law, according to the plaintiffs. Investors claimed they only learned of the tokens' status as securities on April 3, 2019, when the SEC's Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology released a report outlining a number of factors to consider when determining whether a digital token is a \"investment contract\" and thus a security under federal securities laws.\n\nThe federal district court approved Binance's move for summary judgment on two grounds: the plaintiffs' purchases were not domestic transactions subject to U.S. federal and state securities laws, and their claims were time-barred because they began proceedings too late. \n\nPlaintiffs' arguments focused on whether purchases made on the Binance platform were sufficiently linked to the US to be subject to US securities regulations. The United States Supreme Court ruled in Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. that federal securities rules apply to \"transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges, as well as domestic transactions in other securities.\" \n\nAn exchange is considered \"domestic\" under Morrison if it is required to register as a \"national securities exchange.\" [5] If a \"facility of [the] exchange [is] within or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\" registration is necessary. [6] Plaintiffs claimed that Binance is hosted on Amazon Web Services servers in the United States, and that Ethereum blockchain computers in the United States support some Binance transactions. The court determined that using third-party servers located at the third party's discretion was insufficient to classify Binance as a national securities exchange, citing a previous decision holding that transactions routed through computer servers in New York did not render RICO claims domestic in nature. [7] The plaintiffs were also unable to cite any precedent to support their allegation that Binance's other purported U.S. contacts\u2014the use of English on the Binance website, several workers in California, and job advertising in the United States\u2014are sufficient to form a domestic exchange.",

            "text": "P2P, or peer-to-peer, trading has long been a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency environment in crypto marketplaces be it Tycoon, Coinbase or Binance. P2P transactions, similar to the pre-fiat currency barter system, allow traders to directly exchange crypto with one another without the use of a third party or middleman. \nBecause of some of its features for both casual and professional users, such as the ability to chat with one's trading counterparty before completing a transaction, or the possibility of traders personalizing their offerings based on their preferred price, payment methods, and local currency, P2P trading has grown in popularity and adoption. It also has perks like no trade fees and a variety of payment options.\n\nWhile P2P trading is handy, trading with other users might be problematic if there is no third party to handle the transaction on their behalf. In order to protect one's cash, P2P trading should be done on safe and secure platforms like Binance P2P. This will help to avoid cases of fraud or theft by unscrupulous players.\n\nWith recent advancements in P2P markets, crypto exchanges such as Binance have been working hard to improve the P2P experience by adding and enhancing tactics to assure the convenience and security of trading on their platform. P2P escrow is one of these solutions, which ensures that both buyers and sellers are protected from fraud or theft. \n\nThe escrow accomplishes this in two ways: it assists buyers in filing an appeal if the counterparty fails to release the cryptocurrency after payment; and it protects sellers by holding the cryptocurrency in a temporary deposit within the escrow service until the counterparty's payment has been verified. If the payment is not verified within a certain amount of time, the bitcoin is returned to the seller.\n\nBecause of the significant expansion of its customers, Binance took additional steps in the first half of 2021 to double its efforts in guaranteeing a secure and optimal trading environment. Initially, P2P trading on the Binance exchange was only available to verified merchants, but in order to ensure inclusivity and fulfill its promise to provide trading freedom to all of its users, Binance opened up the platform to all users, but with strict rules and guidelines in place to protect and prevent people from losing their funds. Recently, the platform has been expanded and fresh features and regulations have been incorporated to further enhance user protection. Here are just a handful of the many notable steps Binance has taken to make the world a safer place for everyone: \n\nUsers will be required to complete stringent identity verification stages such as indicating the quantity of completed P2P orders, SMS authentication processes, and the number of unique trading counterparties if new trading criteria are added. Fraudulent and untrustworthy offerings or advertisements might be avoided in this way. \n\n\nOrder-Matching Upgrade: Order-matching is a procedure in which exchanges like Binance link one or more unsolicited buy orders with one or more sell orders to make trades, according to Investopedia. The Binance team can ensure that its users may trade with reliable traders and certified merchants by enhancing the matching algorithm.\n\nRisk Management Algorithm Optimization: By improving its risk management algorithms, Binance has been able to better monitor suspicious activity on its P2P network, reducing the trading activities of possible criminal actors. \nUser Education Initiatives: Cryptocurrency companies must provide a safe and secure environment for their consumers, but users must also play a role in protecting their money. Binance has responded by providing consumers with access to an extensive resource on peer-to-peer best practices, hosting P2P webinars throughout the world, and providing security guidelines for trading on its platform.\n\nUsers can be protected from potential theft and encouraged to trade prudently if they have access to this information.\n\nWhile there is no risk-free investment strategy, Binance's initiatives to protect the safety of users in its marketplace allow investors and P2P traders to trade more freely. These actions are a clear indication of the brand's mission to protect its users' assets and provide excellent service while also promoting crypto innovation and growth.",

The overall size of the PIPE will remain at $400 million since Binance assumes previous PIPE commitments, and Binance's participation will be on basically the same conditions as the existing PIPE investors.\n\nThe transactions with Magnum Opus and Binance are reportedly expected to assist Forbes in maximizing its brand and enterprise values, as well as using its proprietary technology stack and analytics to convert readers into long-term, engaged platform customers, including through memberships and recurring subscriptions to premium content and highly targeted product offerings.\n\nThis is a new sign of increased monopoly of the crypto market by Binance. It had been reported earlier that of the Binance ranked the largest cryptocurrency platform with a value of 21billion$ which is more than Upbit(7.44billion$), Coinflex (5.83B), and Deep Coin(5.51B); the second, third and fourth Crypto platforms put together. \n\nIt is clear that the value of Binance will only continue to increase, with BNB being its currency. It should also be noted that Binance has the largest variety of Crypto ranging from the big ones like Bitcoin, Ethereum to other common ones like Altcoin, Litecoin and to even newcomers like $darc and polygon. It is clear that Binance is both the present and future of crypto trading\n\nWouldn't you rather invest in the future technology (Blockchain) while using the future (Binance)?",

            "text": "Binance (BNB), a top-tier crypto asset, lost 0.50 percent today compared to yesterday, although the rate remained stable at $414.59 (BNB/USD). The BNB price reached a high of $426.81 on Wednesday, and it has since declined slightly. Binance, like the rest of the market, was bullish at the end of last month, but that isn't the case right now.\n\nToday, the cryptocurrency market is mostly flat, with Bitcoin (BTC) down 0.66 percent, Ethereum down 0.03 percent, and Solana down 2.04 percent.  Crypto markets like Binance, Tycoon and Coinbase are feeling the effect of this. BNB is right on level with the other major players, and it is clinging to its fourth-place position with vigor. We don't expect it to move much farther from there, but we do expect it to follow the rest of the market. Binance will likely lag behind Bitcoin as it moves, so keep an eye on that main cryptocurrency for clues about what BNB might do.\n\nBecause the big crypto market players have shown no movement, it's possible that we're about to see a shift in one direction or the other. Currently, the war in Ukraine continues, affecting much of Europe and the rest of the world. Inflation is on the rise (4.38 percent as of the last check), and bitcoin is being scrutinized as a number of governments consider tightening regulations. None of this bodes good for BNB's or the crypto market's long-term prospects, but we could see some short-term gains anyway. \n\nMany of the variables that have kept rates where they are (which is worse than last year) are unlikely to change anytime soon. Cryptocurrency may not be a good investment at this time.\n\nBNB may rise during the next week or so, but it may struggle to hang on to any gains. On April 5th, BNB reached a new high of $457.67. This might happen again, and the $450 barrier level is where most investors are keeping an eye on this cryptocurrency. \n\nBNB has no issue sliding below $400 from time to time in recent weeks, thus the support level is around $380. BNB has dipped below $380 a few times this year, and it is possible that it will do so again if there is a bearish market shift.",

They were actually ordered to pass over data pertaining to the country's consumers. Also, the regional head actually exchanged text conversations with a corporate colleague. The Russian authorities requested names and addresses to assist them in investigating crimes.\n\nBinance handed over information to Russian authorities?\n\nThe incidents from April 2021, when Rosfinmonitoring or Rosfin, a Russian organization, was on the trail of huge amounts of money in Bitcoin. And that money was actually collected by imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. All this info was clearly detailed in the report. According to a person close to the situation, Navalny was utilizing the cash to support attempts to uncover corruption in the Vladimir Putin-led administration.\n\nGleb Kostarev, Binance's chief operating officer in Eastern Europe and Russia. He consented to supply Rosfin with the information requested, according to texts between Kostarev and also another business colleague. Kostarev explained to the colleague that he didn't have \"much of an option\" and that he had no choice but to comply. Kostarev did not answer when contacted. Binance, on either side, stated that Russian officials never tried to approach them about Navalny. They also stated that the communication was \"actively seeking adherence in Russia\" prior to the start of the conflict with Ukraine. That would have forced the interaction to accept \"appropriate demands from regulatory agencies and local police departments.\"\n\nAttempts behind the scenes to strengthen connections with the Russian government.\n\nAccording to the chat between Kostarev and the trade colleague, Binance intended to establish a relationship with the Russian authorities. Reporters actually questioned former workers, ex-business colleagues, and cryptocurrency industry officials. Even the text messages made by Kostarev to others outside the company were also scrutinized to substantiate the firm's behind-the-scenes operations.\n\nThat\u2019s not all, there are some other options available like Polygon, Point Network, and many more. Cryptonary, on the other side, has already stated that it plans to grow into Russia and surrounding nations despite the existing restrictions imposed on the country's banks and other businesses.",

The meeting states that the former asked to deliver the customer data which can help in finding the main suspect behind the crimes that are happening in their places.\nThe Russian Authority expected the names and addresses which can be a shred of great evidence against those criminals. \n\nAs per the report from the events from last year\u2019s April, where Rosfin, a Russian Agency was on a mission of tracking millions of dollars in Bitcoin(BTC) which was raised by a Russian opposition leader named Alexei Navalny who was imprisonment.\nMoreover, the report also justified that Navalny was utilizing these pays in funding to uncover the corruption prevalent in Putin\u2019s government.\n\nHowever, Gleb Kostarev, the head of operations of Binance from Eastern Europe as well as Russia has made up for the decision to lend the data to Rosfin. He also added that he had ended up with this decision as he has no other choice rather to only accept it.\n\nWhen we look at the other side of the same coin, Binance is stating that Authorities from Russia had never been to them regarding the Alexei Navalny\u2019s matter. They also added that the exchange was actively seeking compliance from Russia\u2019s Government.\n\nCryptonary recently added that the exchange is looking up in expanding into Russia and the other nearby countries.\n\nRecently, a project called STEPN was listed on binance that caught a lot of attention due to its focus on creating better opportunities in an ecofriendly manner. There are other projects like SET, PLAS, Plastiks that are working actively for sustainable waste management.",

My most humble and best guess is that as Bitcoin approaches 30k Bitcoin dominance will increase and alts will decrease. Then in the next quarter give or take Bitcoin will start its leg up back to all-time highs and dominance will climb towards 70% in this time. Once btc gets near 100k or perhaps sooner the dominance will start to shift back to alts. \n\nRn either blue chip or btc no smalls. Best plan on entry now imo is no leverage buy 10k worth of btc/eth so if correction isn't over you don't lose too much off the rip and if it goes up and we get a real reversal then and nly then think about moving to alts. \n\nIf u must fomo into alts now then blue chip only. \n\nBtc or ether is smartest rn. You can still realize larger gains but first realize a reverse and protect your entry",

The Banner says its via \\\\\"Venus\\\\\", meaning Venus.io as DeFi ledger...](https://preview.redd.it/jj9l6dnu0hs81.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5759907b9c01974abbfd8de788ee9742176ad36)\n\nNow on Venus.. if i want to directly supply BTC(BBTC, as it needs to be BEP20/BSC wrapped to work on BSC) i only get like 0.86%?\n\n[where are the missing 7&#37; interest coming from? Not from Venus!](https://preview.redd.it/ya8wcdx71hs81.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=db49481b95a963a42f58890dc5ce1936455f7c4c)\n\nSince 7% missing interest over 2 months, especially in Bitcoin -- kind of is a huge Risk, i wondered..:\n\n\\- where does Binance get the interest from?- why do they tell us its on Venus, when its clearly not on Venus? Venus is unable to return 8% Interest, does not offer locked investments..- if its not on venus and the interest is generated by binance somehow different - why do they lie about it to us, putting these savings products in a own category \"DeFi Savings\" and having you nod the higher risks?!\n\n8.19% on Bitcoin is ... extremely high to be honest.\n\nI am getting very suspicious at Binance regarding all these DeFi-Frontrunning Products. I don't feel like this is any honest at all; there is no transparencfy and i have the feel Binance is pushing people to actively lock-in funds with high APYs just do lower them significantly, as soon as enough people have done so.\n\ne.g. i once locked a lot of BNB for 120 Days and 12% just to find it drop to 6% in the next weeks - being unable to get any of my locked stakings out.\n\nDoes anybody have similiar experiences? E.g. all those shitcoins dropped by BNB-Vault - they proactively offer high locked-staking APYs to hinder you from just selling it? You should still do so: none of the coins Binance released in the last 2 years made anyone except Binance and the Founders any Money.\n\nNeed examples?\n\nMC  \nTLM  \nLTO  \nLIT  \nQI  \nALICE  \nRIF  \nREEF  \n\n\n... all these distributed Vault-Coins have been at their ATHs straight after release, and drop continously every since.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBinance is abusing its huge marketingpower to shill shitcoins to its millions of users, triggers greed with high APYs (who never raise after you staked but only decline :))) and bullshits everyone into savings products as e.g. 40% for CAKE when you get 64% on [pancakeswap.io](https://pancakeswap.io) directly. (Obviously binance takes 50% of your Interest here just for delegating/frontrunning).\n\nBinance is for noobs who like shitcoins - stay away from 95% of their coins. They are all shit. Nothing substantial ever comes from the Launchpad.\n\nin 2022 Binance Launchpad/Listing have become the exact opposite of what thesy used to be in e.g. 2018/19:\n\nBack then it was a BULLISH SIGNAL if a coin was listed/founded by Binance.  \nIn 2022 its a BEARISH SIGNAL if a coin is dispersed by Binance or founded by it.",

Interest Protocol will farm the loans\u00b4 collateral on PanckaSwap MasterChef and Venus. Investors will be able to use exotic assets such as LP tokens as collateral to borrow DNR while farming them on PCS, which decreases their loan cost. In the case of single assets such as Bitcoin and BNB investors, collateral will be farmed in Venus. In addition, we control the interest rate of DNR loans, which allows us to manipulate the cost of the loan to benefit the borrowers.\n\nOur test net only has BTC as collateral but expects us to add other assets in the main net, including interest-bearing tokens and liquidity provider tokens. The users have to use the BSC test net through their Metamask wallets and click on the faucet in our Dapp to mint a test BTC to get a DNR loan.\n\n* **Test net link:**\n\n[https://www.interestprotocol.com/dapp](https://www.interestprotocol.com/dapp)\n\n**Dinero Market test net**\n\nPlease read our medium article to learn how to use it: [https://medium.com/@interestprotocol/dinero-market-test-net-6bf3e234ddb8](https://medium.com/@interestprotocol/dinero-market-test-net-6bf3e234ddb8)\n\nFeedback form: [https://forms.gle/aDP4wHvshLPKkKv97](https://forms.gle/aDP4wHvshLPKkKv97)\n\n**For more information, check out the following links:**\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.com/invite/PJEkqM4Crk](https://discord.com/invite/PJEkqM4Crk)\n\nTG: [https://t.me/interestprotocol](https://t.me/interestprotocol)",

Simply because Bitcoin is hard-limited and nobody can interfere with the supply. However, markets are irrational and don't do as they're predicted to do.\n\nThere's also something that might have been overlooked here: timescale. In an inflationary crisis, Bitcoin wins. However, even though (hidden) inflation is really beginning to bite big money and small, big money at least has other safe places to which it can run. Namely, real estate and stocks. There are also exciting new industries on the up (machine learning and big data, data wet-dry storage research, green energy and renewables, faster internet connecting technologies) which may offer comparative returns for the same risk or less than cryptos. \n\nIt's a murky picture, and a very different world from the world of the 2008/2009 crash. There are many factors to take into consideration.\n\nCathie Wood is someone who's smart enough to know what she doesn't know, and she keeps people at Ark who are tasked to research these things. However, the crypto economy is a very complex and mixed picture, full of uncertainties and interdependencies. It's a very tough call to make. People who make the naive and arrogant mistake of Bitcoin maximalism (e.g. the Orange Pill twats) based really wild predictions of $400K BTC this year, as if THIS YEAR is 2009. Well, it isn't.",

Bravo.\n\nNow it's time for $SYSCOIN and its CTO's 0.9.2devcoin Counterparty branch for smart contracts on cheaper merge mined with BTC Chain for over 10 years to bring Bitcoin security to your EVM and Ethereum-based networks!!! [https://github.com/devcoin/core/commit/cf3e03bad10368d96294769b740841919b636810](https://github.com/devcoin/core/commit/cf3e03bad10368d96294769b740841919b636810)\n\nGive Jag Sidhu his credit, he's going to shine when u see what he's done (devcoin-android)/counterparty and smartcontracts for later date for cheap and periodically update with the BTC main chain to updated periodically with difficulty/security among SHA-256G Merge Mined chains alongside Syscoin 4.2.2, Namecoin Core 0.22.0, Ixcoin 0.14.1, Devcoin's MM+counterparty OP\\_Return 80 Byte limit for comments defying the 0.9.x Bitcoin \"Core\" slash so Counterparty can work its magic and bridge to EVM chains and back to original Bitcoin hashpower secured SHA-256 L1 chains - Devcoin would be the xDai to mint Rare Pepe's without insane minting fees on Bitcon L1 much like CryptoPunks mint on xDai as xDaiPuks but marketplaces will surely be built as its a specialty of Syscoin Platform and NEVM + Sys-Dev bridges are already in plans.\n\nDevcoin is like a DAO. Distribution is community driven. Work is 10+ years old. People are coming back. Difficulty and distribution make it a great sidechain for BTC to utilize for when it adds its own expanded versions of NFTs, DAOS, SysCoin Markets, etc. so that the Mainnet can just be the settlement chain for all the networks around it like LN networks that build over the Segwit signature and validity data relayer parts separate from the BTC txn part of the txn tied to the Bitcoin Merkle Trees. The other parts SegWit separated allow cheap off-chain validation and proof of ownership etc cheap with only rare settlement going to court chain L1.\n\nAnyway, just because its not a hot $ amount on a CEX like yours doesn't mean some of us carry on the layers that secure your future lucrative profits by further mining L1 coins some not even listed. Mining Tenebrix to support the first Scrypt coin in all crypto - Mining CoinyeCoin $COYE because the value of blockchain and p2p networks never dying despite going against a world wide celeb doesn't matter in this era and that's a land mark value for decentralized freedom for us node operators, the users.\n\nMainly, Binance,  I think you owe a little homage to why you're success has come so far and publicly. Devs that you never write of that keep [devtome.com](https://devtome.com) a doku wiki with tutorials for peanuts teaching people to use crypto since 2012. [Devcoin.org](https://Devcoin.org), the original funders of Bitcoin developers (even selling down DVC prices when complaints were made by Bitcoin devs that they wanted more lucrative BTC so we had to buy it). But we're coming back so be ready. And last time i checked a US based customer with SEC and EU approval to invest in real estate should be allowed to trade on your exchange. So why the hate?\n\nSys is gonna show you how long Security of the old slow SHA-256 Hash POWERED chains and distributed currencies like none other will be the basis of the Internet of Trust and DAO/Social communities that make their own money beneficiary from that early work soon enough. CZ, it's time to say the truth. For god sake you're trading the backbone of the internet \"ARPA\" 1963 (the first 3 college network with \"email\" connection and Bell Labs sponsored) with the RUB (fiat Ruble). if thats not a sign that  we can move on with the truth I'm telling you it is. Same reasons Canadians have royal charters that allow them to buy some amazing OTC stocks I luckily own but thru their pre Canadian nationhood Royal Bank of Canada or their SEC unreachable parent companies of TDA via Toronto-Dominion Bank.\n\nSHOW THIS TEAM SOME LOVE [https://github.com/orgs/syscoin/people](https://github.com/orgs/syscoin/people) They're bringing you #NEVM and more with $SYS - you should  be pumped r/BinanceUS\n\nThey're allowing all your tokens that have a need for L1 security and not CEX databases so you can securely reach your most valuable implementation thru Bitcoin merge mined L1 via SyS ...

This continues Binance\u2019s commitment to making the Binance-branded, U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin accessible to as many channels as possible around the world.\u00a0  \n>  \n>Specifically, BUSD will use the Syscoin Platform Token (SPT) model and many of its unique features to facilitate the use of BUSD and drive massive adoption, giving more benefits to all BUSD users.  \n>  \n>\u201cStablecoins are increasing in popularity and as a market leader in this ecosystem, Binance is always looking for ways to scale BUSD and improve public adoption. Our collaboration with Blockchain Foundry will allow BUSD to be used on the Syscoin platform and the Syscoin Ethereum bridge,\u201d said Samuel Lim, Binance\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer.  \n>  \n>\ud83d\udcf7  \n>  \n>How the Use of the Syscoin Ethereum Bridge Benefits BUSD Users  \n>  \n>The Syscoin Ethereum Bridge is a decentralized Finance (DeFi) application that enables ERC-20 tokens to move back and forth between the Syscoin and Ethereum blockchains. This bridge can provide fast, scalable, and low-cost transactions for BUSD users, while also maintaining regulatory compliance provided by Ethereum.  \n>  \n>\u201cStablecoins are a growing source of network congestion on the Ethereum network today. The congestion [creates expensive transaction fees and slow settlement times](https://coincodex.com/article/8762/why-ethereum-developers-frustrated-by-fees-should-be-using-blockchain-bridges/). By using blockchain interoperability bridges, ERC-20 stablecoin projects can substantially reduce transaction costs and improve speed. In a quick [cost comparison](https://syscoin.org/fees/) between Ethereum and Syscoin transaction fees, ERC-20 projects can save their users thousands of dollars by reducing costs with the Syscoin blockchain,\u201d according to a statement from Blockchain Foundry.  \n>  \n>Blockchain Foundry added that blockchain auditing firm Whiteblock Inc. tested the scalability of Syscoin\u2019s Z-DAG [(Zero Confirmation Directed Acyclic Graph)](https://syscoin.org/zdag_syscoin_whitepaper.pdf) scaling technology. According to the [audit report](https://syscoin.org/tps_whiteblock_syscoin_report.pdf), Syscoin\u2019s network can provide a burst capacity of 60,000 TPS (transactions per second) and a peak of 140,000 TPS.  \n>  \n>Binance and Blockchain Foundry will work together to explore ways of bringing more Syscoin features to BUSD users.  \n>  \n>BUSD, issued by Binance and Paxos, is approved and regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).\n\nWake up Winklevosses - PAX partnership with BUSD is nothing compared to SEC untouchable Blockchain consultant and innovator (the creators of Syscoin Protocol, the public CSE:BCFN stock they are going to use to benefit the crypto project.. - you're about to get your entry into Us Equities after Canadian ADR's for Blockchain Foundry Inc. $BLFDF and the CSE trade $BCFN securities are untouchable by the SEC, the final dagger in old law to the new law - code is law - blockchain is unstoppable. Welcome CZ, Welcome Binance. Meet coins worth far more than anything you've listed and have 100's of devs who worked for peanuts to keep these secrets over a decade because theyre are building the next web, internet, and future of UBI and money for everyone to eat dinner, employers to hire, people to live in sheltered houses... thats why i love these FinTech projects. The donations aside of most of these DAOs and charity crytos back to [devcoin.org](https://devcoin.org) in 2011 - this is the way to give the world its health back, its happiness back, and its lack of concern for materialism they don't have.\n\nI think that's why I like the Syscoin and Blockchain Foundry Inc. folks the best. They're clever geniuses and they have built everything that will make the North American supply chain and financial opportunities better for so so many people in to the south of them and I never had more pleasant encounters with people and was happier than 2013-2015 when I spent 3 hours playing baseball in Canada and absorbing all the cultural differences I could.\n\nBlockchain Foundry Inc.

That's why Canadians are buyin stock the US brokers scared of SEC aren't allowing Americans to buy but hey I'm happy for Canada. The SEC is a Commission.

This post is intended for Binancians new to DeFI  with the aim of showcasing simple but profitable liquidity farming techniques in BSC.\n\n**A Layman Introduction to Decentralized Finance (DeFI)**\n\nWhen people talk about DeFI, usually it means they\u2019re playing around with a chrome browser extension called MetaMask. MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet for EVM compatible blockchain like Ethereum, Binance smart chain, polygon and etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fsjpb4i89v981.png?width=200&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf50017c6cb847bdde609cb474faf9cb6fa8917f\n\n[https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)\n\nThere\u2019s also a dedicated binance chain wallet, \n\n[https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/binance.html](https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/binance.html)\n\nWith easier integration to your binance account though it doesn\u2019t yet have a mobile app version, so if you plan to interact mostly from your phone,  stick to Metamask. Both wallets let\u2019s you interact with smart contracts in the blockchain via frontend websites called Dapps/WEB3.0. You can do a lot of things in those Dapps like making bets, trading,  saving/lending , staking and providing liquidity.\n\n**Providing Liquidity in DeFI**\n\nIn a DeFI Decentralized Exchange (DEX) like Ethereum\u2019s Uniswap or their BSC counterpart, Pancakeswap,  there are no order books instead every trade you make happens against a liquidity pool provided by liquidity providers (LP). The mechanism is called Automated Market Makers (AMM), in which liquidity providers stake an equal value of paired tokens, ETH-USDT for example, and in return for facilitating trade receives a LP/Flip token and \\~ 0.17-0.25%  of the trade volume that occurs in that pool. \n\n[https://finematics.com/liquidity-pools-explained/](https://finematics.com/liquidity-pools-explained/)\n\n**Introducing Binance Smart Chain (BSC), the 2nd most popular destination for LPs**\n\nAs Ethereum gas fees (the cost to make a transaction in the blockchain) has risen to hundreds of dollars per Tx, it has driven a lot of retail investors to BSC. BSC currently holds the top position in number of transactions per day and wins in ease of use due to the smooth integration of it\u2019s bsc wallet with binance.com. Being  a much younger ecosystem compared to ETH there are still plenty of opportunities in BSC to get high passive income returns measured in annualized percentage yield (APY) however the low barrier to entry has also made it into a  \u201crug pull central\u201d of sorts for scam coins and projects. \n\n**How to tell if a BSC DeFI project is a scam/Ponzi** \n\nOk this is important to know before you go diving into BSC and it\u2019s not only about all the dog and moon coins out there but plenty of other projects that looks very formal and solid but is actually a Ponzi/scam.  Technically speaking, A Ponzi scheme is **an investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors**.  In my view, in general, a coin or a Dapp needs to provide some other functions besides playing tricks with liquidity to not be considered as a Ponzi. For example, Pancakeswap facilitates coin trading in BSC, Venus provides crypto savings/lending and Chromia is a SaaS for games. You can tell those are not Ponzi as they provide actual utility while the Ponzi ones usually starts with a variation of the following statement\n\n*\u201cWhy is bitcoin considered to not be a Ponzi \u2026. \u201c*\n\nThen will go on to explain why similar to bitcoin,  their coin/project is also not a Ponzi  due to the belief from a large group of people and some convoluted explanation on how their advanced algorithm maintains liquidity. Of course it usually has some crazy high APYs like 1,000,000% for staking and  do a lot of rebasing. Rebasing is the practice of reducing and or increasing the supply of a token, including the ones already in your wallet to achieve a certain price target. So for the token creators to let\u2019s say increase the price by 1,000%, rather then buying the tokens in the liquidity pools he could just reduce the supply by 90%. Obviously in this process no real value is created as it\u2019s just a liquidity shell game which would have to collapse at some point. \n\n**Nonetheless there are plenty of genuine gems in BSC**\n\n**Like Pancakeswap (PCS) for example,** they are the leading DEX in BSC and have surpassed Uniswap in both transaction count and volume since a few months ago.  PCS provides farming rewards for liquidity providers which means in addition to receiving LP fees from the trading pool, Liquidity Providers can also stake the LP tokens in PCS farms to receive rewards in CAKE token. This reward is often more lucrative then the trading fees it self as it can reach hundreds of percent APY depending on the amount of liquidity in the pool.  A popular LP pair for investors in PCS is the CAKE-BNB pair which earns great rewards while not being too volatile. \n\n**Calculating**  **Liquidity Providing Profit in Pancakeswap**\n\nYou can use a google sheet I created to model Pool value and profit vs  changes in the underlying token prices. , \n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h0uzbnpO7SP1mPw3tj2w-CJ2wKsx7P4DCHgKflgJWoY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h0uzbnpO7SP1mPw3tj2w-CJ2wKsx7P4DCHgKflgJWoY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nSo for example, to model the BNB-BUSD liquidity pair, from PCS analytics info we know that the LP fees ,the estimated transaction fees APR this pool will receive,  is about 15%  and the farming rewards is 20%. From Binance website we see that if you stake BNB you\u2019ll earn about \\~9-10% a year and for BUSD it\u2019s about 3%. \n\nBased on the above info, assuming we provide liquidity for a year, we Input the following parameters to the sheet\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hg0uxwec9v981.jpg?width=1008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9351cc4486661c42a0273fbf11428954c087b620\n\nAnd it will generate the following charts\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l484idzd9v981.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=10db2bd76b70ebc6cc3c3313ed04f08f1672ee26\n\nThe horizontal x axis is the % change of token A (BNB)  while the y axis is the profit % of LP or Staking single coins. \n\nThe above profit profile present the benefits of holding a LP pair vs staking single tokens, as it provides massive downside protection while still giving you good upside performance since Pancakeswap farming rewards mitigates the impermanent loss affect.\n\n**Use LP autocompounding smart contracts.**\n\nTo further maximize your profit and minimize risk, best to put your LP into an autocompounding smart contract.  Those vault contracts automatically retrieve your farming rewards in CAKE, convert them to LPs and redeposit  it back into PCS farming pool, effectively compounding your principal and boosting your APYs.  For autocompounding vaults, I\u2019d like to recommend [happyhippo.farm](https://happyhippo.farm), made by yours truly, the place where hippos are happy and everything is awesome, like the lego movie theme song. To help new traders settle in, hippo has a convenience Zap function that allows you convert directly from BNB/BUSD/BTCB/ETH/DAI to your desired LP pairs.\n\n**Summarizing,**\n\nTo make easy money in BSC DeFI, follow these steps\n\n1. Pick a Pancakeswap LP pair you like which has tokens that hopefully won\u2019t go to 0 in less then a year. Use the google sheet to model P&L if needed. \n\n2. Deposit those LPs into an autocompounding vault.\n\n3. Don\u2019t give your private key/seed phrase to strangers\n\n4. Profit !",

Do you think that every new token traded only via liquidity pools is ponzi by definition? \n\nI mean at first people give BNB to the liquidity pool to get the token (aka shitcoin) and then they sell the token to get the BNB back. People need to fill the LP with BNBs first (often the shitcoin creators give something ridiculous like 1 BNB only to the LP pair) and then those who sell first get the most money back paid from other peoples money. Those who do not sell in time are the bag holders.\n\n99% of shitcoins are super short lived pump and dumps. 1) Create token 2) Buy it for super cheap 3) Convince someone to buy it for more 4) Dump on him 5) No one is gonna buy it anymore and the coin is over. 6) You can create new token and repeat",

Since Bitcoin is \"digital gold\", can we go back to the system and create an International Bitcoin Standard?\n\nIn this episode, we will uncover why Bitcoin will never play a role in the international monetary order. We do this by uncovering the various international monetary order the world has seen \u2014 International Gold Standard, Bretton Woods, Plaza Louvre Accord.\n\n# 1. Lessons Learnt from International Monetary Order (IMO)\n\nWe need an international monetary order to coordinate countries' monetary policy and macro-policies.How? We do that by having rules and countries must follow.At the end of the day, we need price stability and financial stability in an IMO.\n\n# 2. Bitcoin's Role in IMO\n\nBitcoin has the function as a store of value due to people's believe in the price level. Yet, it is difficult to be a medium of exchange nor unit if account due to the price volatility.It will still function on a P2P level, but not on an international trade level. Because it is not meant to do so, as much as the neolibertarians would love for it to be true.\n\n# 3. Why Bitcoin will never be part of IMO?\n\nBitcoin's in-code governance of monetary policy is unlike that of central banks. It does not have any nominal anchor to target price stability. So, it will be difficult for it to play a role in the IMO, and replace like the USD.Also, Bitcoin does not have a discretionary control over its monetary base (which is good!). So if we use Bitcoin like gold and have money backed by gold, it will work for a while until it stops working, like how the international gold standard failed.And because of that, other countries will not want to anchor their currencies to bitcoin. And you also do not see bitcoin anchoring the exchange rates to other countries due to the in-code governance.\n\n## What Else You've Missed\n\n* Rules of the game and monetary policy rules countries must abide by\n* Failure of the various international monetary order\n* Problems and solutions to the various orders\n* What's next for international monetary order, considering that things like Facebook's Libra and stable coins exist\n* Why it is important to have such coordination from an international level? Because otherwise, the casualty in this financial playing field is people like you and me!\n\n**TLDR**:Bitcoin's automated monetary policy does not have a nominal anchor and thus does not strive for price nor financial stability. It will continue to function on a P2P level, as it was meant to be. But not on an international trade and finance level, as it was not designed to do so",

            "text": "## Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, abbreviated as SWIFT, is a globally-scaled payment platform offering seamless intercontinental money transfer. The SWIFT organization is located in Belgium and comprises a network of 11,000 banks in more than 200 countries. Initially founded by banks in Europe and America, it has evolved over time to be operated by over 2,000 financial institutions.\n\nIt is managed by the National Bank of Belgium, the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, as well as other prominent banks across the globe. While SWIFT\u2019s ban affects most Russian banks, two of its biggest \u2013 Sberbank and Gazprombank \u2013 have not been included. This is because the two are the major channels for payments for Russian oil and gas, which EU countries are still buying. However, an EU official [**noted**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/russian-banks-out-cold-eu-unveils-swift-sanctions-2022-03-02/) that the two banks have been subjected to other punitive measures.\n\nAdditionally, the recent sanctions intend to deprive Russia of important sources of revenue generation such as the trade of agricultural products and energy service with countries over its border via SWIFT. According to the European Union, the ban will *\"ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally\".*\n\nAs a result, Russian banks would have to settle for a slower, more expensive direct communication with foreign banks. Back in 2014, the EU threatened to remove Russia from the SWIFT network for the annexation of Crimea. Russia made it known that the implementation of the threat would be interpreted as an act of war. Even though the EU and its allies eventually didn't eject Russia from SWIFT, the Russian government took the threat as a signal to develop its own international transfer network.\n\nTo protect the country from such sanctions, a National Payment Card System was created for handling card payments, but it only saw minimal adoption.\n\n## > [Full Article](https://changenow.io/blog/bitcoin-surges-as-russian-crypto-adoption-increases) <\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7goqxgzk27l81.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=800577c9e153c5a4fa6cd2f9d05d28c800f8a247",

Bitcoin is down more than 10% in the last 24 hours. The price even briefly touched a low of $36,100. At the time of writing, the price of 1 BTC token is around $36,300. The fact that the US federal reserve will raise interest rates and reduce support for the economy has caused enormous fear in the stocks and crypto market. This resulted in massive liquidations. More than $726 million in crypto positions have been liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass. Bulls are responsible for over 81% of this massive volume.  Right now i am bullish on a few projects like: Rise up, Earth2, Atpay and Spores. Im very glad I've found them. DYOR!",

            "text": "**Overview**\n\nAbout your author: CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from our weekly [Moonshot Monday](https://cryptoquestion.tech/weekly-podcast/) podcast to our weekly Staking and Farming Review. Visit us at [www.cryptoquestion.tech](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)\n\nWe started the year by conducting a top down review of all the platforms on our list. We removed Venus as we believe they don\u2019t offer investors anything special, for example you can stake CAKE on [Pancakeswap](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pancakeswap) and earn a considerably higher APR. We also added two new platforms from the \u2018DeFi 2.0\u2019 contingent, namely Olympus DAO, the reserve currency and Convex Finance.\n\nThere are some juicy Staking APRs available from both the centralized exchanges and DEXs including 32% for staking EOS with Kucoin, 23% for staking KAVA with Kraken and 65% for staking CAKE on Pancakeswap. The meanest staking reward was a measly 0.25% for staking Bitcoin on Kraken.\n\nAmongst the most generous farming rewards were Harvest\u2019s 2,359% for MEME20-ETH and Pancakeswap\u2019s 1,197% for INSUR-BNB.\n\nThis week we are also reviewing three platforms that have emerged from what is called DeFi 2.0.\n\n[**This week\u2019s APRs from leading staking and yield farming platforms**](https://cryptoquestion.tech/stakingandfarming/)\n\n*There is one thing we would like to draw to your attention. We noticed that more and more platforms are restricting US users. This could be highly inconvenient if this happens after you have invested. We would suggest as a US investor you tread very cautiously when entering this market in these very uncertain times.*\n\n**Platform Review**\n\nThis week we are taking a look at the phenomenon which is what has become known as DeFi 2.0. DeFi 2.0 is really only a refinement of all the original DeFi protocols aimed at improving user experience, increasing liquidity and reducing transaction fees (gas) and increasing transaction speed.\n\nThe one platform that has taken much of the credit for leading the way in the DeFi 2.0 revolution is Olympus DAO with its OHM token. OHM has spawned a number of copies or forks known as OHM forks, the main ones are Wonderland Abracadabra and Convex Finance.\n\nThe market value of these platforms have exploded exceeding over $7 billion. There have been hundreds of copycat platforms, mostly anonymous teams and plenty of rug pulls.\n\nOlympus DAO was launched in February 2021 to solve the problem of borrowed liquidity which can quickly migrate to another platform if APRs prove more attractive elsewhere. With OHM crypto assets are swapped with OHM tokens and Olympus DAO ends up owning their own liquidity. They call this a reserve currency backed by the assets they hold in their treasury. But it is not without risks. The main one being that the value of OHM is 6 times higher than the value of tokens held in their treasury. Put another way, if there was a liquidation token holders would receive 14 cents on the dollar at current valuations. The concept however is a good one and to entice investors OHM and other players in this market are offering massive APRs, OHM is currently paying an APR of 46k%.\n\n**Olympus DAO**\n\nOlympus (OHM) aims to become a decentralized reserve currency that is community owned, governed by a DAO, and backed by decentralized assets.\n\nThe team designed OHM to be a stable reserve currency using economic force. An algorithm is used to rebalance the supply of OHM tokens in the market in order to maintain the peg.\n\nThe Olympus project has 2 primary methods to prevent traders from selling off OHM which will introduce buy pressure to the DAO.\n\n1. Staking is used to incentivized token holders to lock their OHM to receive rebase rewards\n2. Bonds are introduced to incentivized liquidity providers to lock in their liquidity.\n\nThe market cap of OHM is $2.2 billion with TVL or owned liquidity at $300 million. This in our opinion makes Olympus DAO a high risk proposition despite the high APR of 46k%.\n\n**Convex Finance**\n\nConvex is a protocol that simplifies Curve boosting experience in order to maximize yields. Convex allows Curve liquidity providers to earn trading fees and claim boosted CRV without locking CRV themselves. Liquidity providers can receive boosted CRV and liquidity mining rewards with minimal effort.\n\nIf you want to stake CRV, Convex lets users receive trading fees as well as a share of boosted CRV received by liquidity providers. This allows for a better balance between liquidity providers and CRV stakers as well as better capital efficiency.\n\nCurve liquidity providers can deposit their LP tokens into Convex to maximize their CRV earnings with a more efficient boost.\n\nCurve DAO token stakers will be able to earn additional boosted CRV and CVX tokens through the protocol.\n\nConvex Finance has become the top yield farming platform with over $20 billion of TVL. This rapid elevation can be attributed to its improved user experience and attractive returns.\n\n**Wonderland**\n\nThe Wonderland project is a decentralized reserve currency protocol available on the Avalanche Network, backed by assets in the treasury. Its goal is to build a policy-controlled currency system, native on the AVAX network, which optimizes for stability and consistency so that TIME (Wonderland's currency token) can function as a global unit-of-account and medium of exchange. In order to achieve price stability without fiat money, Wonderland intends to optimize the system for growth and wealth creation.\n\nLike Olympus DAO it\u2019s token is backed by its own liquidity. Wonderland\u2019s market value is however below its TVL making this a more interesting proposition than OHM. It\u2019s APR is an eye watering 66,000%.\n\nBefore investing into OHM or OHM copycats one must check the following.\n\n1. What is the discount or premium on the assets held in the treasury compared to the market value of the token?\n2. What is the quality of the assets held in the treasury?\n3. How liquid are the tokens you are buying? It doesn\u2019t matter how much the discount is if you can\u2019t sell them in the market.\n4. What is the likelihood of a scam or rugpull? This is an essential consideration when looking at investing in new OHM forks where a good proportion are scams.\n\n[**To subscribe to our FREE weekly staking guide please follow this link**](https://cryptoquestion.tech/stakingandfarming/)\n\nFollow us on Twitter [@cryptoimpartial](https://twitter.com/cryptoimpartial) and Instagram [@cryptoimpartial](https://www.instagram.com/cryptoimpartial/) and register for our newsletter here [www.cryptoquestion.tech](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)\n\nJoin our Telegram channel [here](https://t.me/joinchat/htKJi3PkuyJiM2U5).\n\nNo Financial Advice\n\nThis report does not constitute financial advice or a recommendation to buy in any way.

From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from our weekly** [**Moonshot Monday**](https://cryptoquestion.tech/weekly-podcast/) **podcast to our weekly Staking and Farming Review. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)\n\nHow the crypto world has changed since we wrote this same article one year ago!\n\nThis year the community picks are a little more diverse ranging from memecoins, play to earn games and DeFi projects. Like last year we weeded out what we considered total crap.\n\nWe also added a small section of cryptocurrencies that didn\u2019t make the list.\n\nSimilar to last year, in order to compile this report we drew information from Crypto Twitter, our own Telegram channel and Reddit.\n\nThis review is not a recommendation to buy and you should conduct your own due diligence before buying.\n\n**Key market indicators**\n\nBefore we get into this year's moonshots let\u2019s take a look at how the market has changed over a year from a top down perspective.\n\n2021 2022\n\nListed coins 6,112 16,238\n\nMarket Cap $0.815 B $2.22 T\n\nBitcoin $32,127 $47,024\n\nEthereum $774 $3,712\n\nDeFi value locked $18.7 B $247.48 B\n\nAs you can see, 2021 was a transformative year in crypto with over 10,000 new projects joining the market and total market value of all listed coins exploding to $2.2 trillion.\n\n**Crypto Moonshots 2021**\n\nThat leads us nicely to the selections the community made last year.\n\nWhoever said, \u2018Don\u2019t follow the crowd\u2019, would have been looking like a total fool after last year's outstanding performance.\n\nThe 28 selections were up by a massive 792% collectively. The standout performer was MATIC - [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polygon](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polygon) \\- which saw its market cap increase by 11,000%. Other top performers were Hedera 2k%, Kryll 1.3k% and Dent 1.8k%.\n\n**Summary of last year's performance**\n\nView table [here](https://cryptoquestion.tech/report-crypto-moonshots-for-2022/)\n\n***Launch of the Moonshot Incubator***\n\n*We are all searching for the next big thing. With that in mind we are launching the Moonshot Incubator to help crypto talent develop and launch their ideas.*\n\n*We are looking for advisors, mentors and founder investors who are interested in acting as a sounding board for exciting new crypto projects.*\n\n*You will need to be experienced in the crypto market and willing to invest risk capital into the projects which we present to you assuming you find them enticing of course.*\n\n*You will get to see investments early and have an opportunity to invest in the project prior to a listing.*\n\n*If this is something you are interested in please join our* [*Telegram channel*](https://t.me/%20-mjPK5SWks03NDgx)*.*\n\n*If you are an entrepreneur with a great idea and maybe the crypto market is new to you and you want help to navigate your way through this minefield then* [*email us*](http://chat@cryptoquestion.tech/) *to find out how you can join our incubator program.*\n\n**Crypto Moonshots 2022**\n\nLet\u2019s be honest it is going to take a miracle of some sorts to exceed the communities 2021 picks. We do however have the benefit of buying in at a trough in the market after many projects are down by at least 50% from their recent highs and the market is down 25% from its peak.\n\nAs we indicated earlier this list is more diversified than last year. Many of the outstanding performers from last year's list were infrastructure projects. This year most of the picks consist of memecoins, DeFi platforms and play to earn NFT games. We will reserve our judgment to the overall quality of the list, you can make that call!\n\nIt is worth saying however, there will be some winners amongst the communities list of 26 possible moonshots. Your job is to research your favorites and only invest what you can afford to lose. Remember past performance is no indicator of future performance.\n\nWith that said, here is this year's list.\n\nView table [here](https://cryptoquestion.tech/report-crypto-moonshots-for-2022/)\n\nFinally, here is a short list of cryptocurrencies that didn\u2019t make the main list.\n\nView table [here](https://cryptoquestion.tech/report-crypto-moonshots-for-2022/)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLast year saw the market take a new fresh look at some infrastructure projects and re-evaluate them. The quality projects like MATIC, Dent, and The Graph shone through and saw massive gains for investors.\n\nThis year it is going to be harder to make the same gains, but there are areas such as the Metaverse and play to earn NFT games that offer the chance of outsized profits. However as an investor we must be careful not to pile into the latest craze as many of the leading metaverse projects and gaming platforms have already been priced to perfection. Meaning there is limited upside for new investors. This year a better strategy may well be to sit patiently and wait for price weakness before buying into quality projects remembering to take profits when the opportunity arises.\n\nWhatever strategy you decide to follow, we wish you a happy and successful 2022!\n\nFollow us on Twitter [@cryptoimpartial](https://twitter.com/cryptoimpartial) and Instagram [@cryptoimpartial](https://www.instagram.com/cryptoimpartial/) and register for our newsletter here [www.cryptoquestion.tech](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)\n\nJoin our Telegram channel [here](https://t.me/joinchat/htKJi3PkuyJiM2U5).\n\nNot Financial Advice\n\nThis article does not constitute financial advice or a recommendation to buy in any way.

With this L1 you can create UTXO tokens with opt in regulation compliance with near instant transactions at 140k TPS and with fractional NFTs. \n\nNot until Zkrollups looked like becoming a reality did the developers decide to build a smart contracts layer, doing so in less than a year. \nBefore then there wasn\u2019t any hope to secure a foothold against Ethereum without sacrificing security to speed up and cheapen the smart contracts. The devs were holding out for a L2 solution, and that breakthrough has come with Zkrollups. \n\nThere is belief in the team that once Ethereum pivots to PoS, there won\u2019t be much point in any other L1, and most likely the other monolithic chains will become rollups on top of Ethereum. \n\nSyscoin will retain an element of the market as it will offer an alternative settlement option for the contracts, Syscoin\u2019s PoW, which is secured by Bitcoins PoW. \nOffering this alternative layer of security will likely see Syscoin and Ethereum being the 2 remaining L1s in a rollup centric Web3.0 landscape.",

            "text": " \n\n  \n\nWe provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**:\n\nAbove is our analysis of Bumper Finance, a protocol that protects users' assets through a risk conversion mechanism. To do this, we need to design a suitable tokenomics that is enough to incentivise the parties to have certain benefits. Also increases the value of $BUMP and the network over time. After designing tokenomics based on reasonable assumptions, we proceed to evaluate and analyse those variables according to TVL and demand for the protocol. Finally, we have the logical results below:\n\n1. **Cash flow**: 528.24% and 174.67% YoY growth\n2. **Ecosystem reward based on the Sigmoid Curve**: 36.47%, 69.85%, 94.88% YoY emission of the network incentive\n3. **Total token emission rate**: 22.50%, 11.31% YoY inflation rate.\n4. **Token Utility (Demand) Forecast**: network incentive would end on month 25. Then, only the protocol\u2019s boost and stake functions would be used to support its future token issuance.\n5. **Circulating Supply Analysis**: scenario analysis by ideal and reasonable case. Under the reasonable case, 30% of the token supply will be held whereas 70% will be sold, resulting in a long term stabilised price of the $BUMP token at around $5.50.\n6. **FDV Analysis**: the FDV is high as protocol revenue will grow faster than the theoretical value of the token.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# General Conclusion\n\nIn this article, we analyse Bumper Finance shortly, by breaking down the fundamental drivers of the protocol, token supply, token demand and market activity.\n\n* First, we analyse protocol cash flow, in comparing to similar price protection protocols.\n* Secondly, we examine the token supply model, including creating an additional sigmoid function in token distribution.\n* Thirdly, given the various incentive policies designed by the Bumper team, we study and report on the internal demand function of the token.\n* Fourthly, we combine cash flow, token supply and dynamics of token demand analyses into a circulating supply analysis, giving two possible scenarios - ideal and reasonable.\n* Fifthly, we give our insights to the fully diluted value (FDV) analysis, as a proxy to the analysed performance of the token and ecosystem.\n* Finally, we provide some provide some insight into our some discussions and iterations we had, with the Bumper team which precipitated several enhancements given our insights, to improve accuracy of the model and analysis.\n\n# What Is Bumper Finance?\n\nBumper Finance is a DeFi price protection protocol built on Ethereum mainnet. Bumper provides a mechanism by which holders of the underlying asset can maintain the value of their position against a decline in the price of this asset in the market.\n\nBumper Finance works by transferring risk to the risk-taker (Maker) and receiving some income from the risk-averse party (Taker).\n\n>Bumper is a price insurance protocol.\n\n# Bumper\u2019s Token Model\n\nBumper is a crypto asset price protection protocol. The assets include Ethereum and (wrapped) Bitcoin for their initial release, and this forms the basis of our analysis.\n\n* The core mechanism - price protection for Takers who pay premiums which are collectively earned by Makers - provides the incentives for Makers and Takers to transact with the protocol.\n* The native token of Bumper, $BUMP, is used as an access token which is required to be \u201cbonded\u201d (locked) with the protocol to take out a position. The required bond is calculated as a proportion of the $USDC value of the user\u2019s position.",

            "text": "Its centralized exchanges\n\nI was just checking the BTC dominance and it is  at ~42%. It hasn't moved at all. This is strange because we had a standard -20 to -30% correction. Almost all Alts have bleed against BTC so unless there has been some flippening it dosn't add up \n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/\n\nPeople are selling their Alts for fiat. While BTC is being accumulated with amount on exchanges at ATL; 6.2% \n\nhttps://www.viewbase.com/exchange\n\nOn chain analysis shows that most BTC address are becoming HODLers. With OTC desks now accounting for nearly ~80% of BTC trade \n\nSo we have:\n\n1. 6.2% of BTC on exchanges \n2. Of that 6.2% most are HODLers \n3. 80% of trading is via OTC limiting price impact\n4. Alts bleeding against BTC but no movement in dominance \n\n\nSo who is selling BTC?\n\nThe answer is no one? \n\nIn simplest terms centralized exchanges; most likely Binance, Kucoin and Bitfinex are selling thin air via USDT backed leveraged trading. On Bitfinex alone ETH and BTC shorts are over 2 billion \n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSDSHORTS/\n\nBut you asking yourself why would these shorts effect price so much?. They don't themselves but in combination with spot leveraged trading and USDT backed printed reserves. They create fictitious BTC balances in their users accounts \n\nBy which I mean that Tearher prints USDT to cover gaps in accounts on Binance and co. While Binance then leverages those amounts on trades. Creating fictitious BTC trades. With no real BTC being traded. Based on the open intrest and liquidations with no movement in BTC \n\nI estimate that at least 60% to 70% of all BTC being traded is fictitious\n\nThis is in line with a past study that suggested that nearly 95% of trades where fictitious: https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/22/majority-of-bitcoin-trading-is-a-hoax-new-study-finds.html\n\nHowever now with the aid of USDT those trades are trapping fiat in exchanges. Not just bogus limit orders to fatten the order books \n\nIf I'm even remotely correct it would mean that Binance is most likely  insolvent. They are holding a huge amount of worthless USDT: https://coinranking.com/coin/HIVsRcGKkPFtW+tetherusd-usdt\n\nAs Binance at $28 billion USDT trading volume is 3x the next exchange\n\nThis USDT not their own BUSD is what is covering the fictitious BTC that they are trading. As in actuality Binance only holds $15 billion ( ~292k BTC) of which as discussed isn't being traded by the users. \n\nhttps://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/wallet/Binance-coldwallet\n\nThey most likely: \n\n1. Started \"lending\" out users balances and displayed fictitious amounts in accounts \n2. Due to supply shock started fractional accounts. Partially backed by USDT. E.g USDT supply increase correlated with BTC outflows from exchanges \n3. Now actully are highly insolvent in both actual BTC and fiat. Holding mainly USDT \n\nTo clarify when I mean partially backed by USDT I mean that on Binance if your account says 2 BTC. You can only withdraw 1 BTC at most. The other BTC doesn't exist it's a fictitious BTC created by USDT backed trades on the platform. \n\nTherefore if an actual parabolic run where to occur. It would be the worst case scenario for these exchanges. As they don't actully have the fiat or crypto to cover the withdrawals \n\nIf BTC when to $100k and people started wanting to exit. They wouldn't be able to exit in fiat but only USDT which is functionally useless outside the fictitious BTC scam. Of the decided to withdraw BTC from Binance to US backed ones such as Kraken and Coinbase it would be the same. \n\nThis is why ~ 80% of BTC trade is now OTC \n\nSo it is to the benefit of centralized exchanges to keep the price if  BTC artificially low. Done through mass liquidations that reduce pressure on the system. \n\nIt is my belief that on May 19th 2021 it was the near collapse of this system that caused both the crash and the outages on exchanges. Totaling $1 trillion in value to be lost in hours \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.euronews.com/next/amp/2021/05/20/nearly-1-trillion-has-just-been-wiped-off-the-cryptocurrency-market-what-happened",

            "text": "If you are reading this post it means you are probably interested in trading cryptocurrency. Count yourself lucky, because you live in a time where an entirely new platform of technology is in its infancy. This means there is money to be made. A little about me, I have a masters (working on a PhD) in political-economy, former Wall St broker turned software developer.\n\nI've been watching crypto since 2011 when I was a stock broker in NYC. At that time I was working on high frequency trading algorithms in equities, because even at that point, there was no point in trading manually any more. Then along comes crypto. It made immediate sense to me. But getting in was flippin' difficult. Your computer science degree needed a computer science degree just to figure out how to get a wallet.  There was nothing intuitive about buying crypto. So I stayed on the sidelines for a few years.\n\n# As of the time of this writing crypto is in a 3rd phase.\n\nThey can be broken down like this:\n\n**Phase 1 - 2010-2016 justification**\n\nThe world was asking \"What is crypto?\" Bitcoin was proving its existence and that people could understand and get behind the idea of a digital currency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Phase 2 - 2016-2018 the platform wars and the ICO craze.**\n\nA lot of scams, but this is where a few platforms and altcoins proved their metal and the constructs of the crypto universe were norming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Phase 3 - 2018-present Creating the ecosystem**\n\nestablishment of blockchain, smart contracts, and NFTs. Aside from domain names, it is difficult to own a digital asset. You need to be able to prove ownership of something that is non-fungible, through a transaction that is fungible.\n\nPeople should be realizing by now that NFTs are the scarce resource, bitcoin and altcoin are the fungible token used to purchase a resource, and smart contracts/blockchain are the proof of the transaction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Phase 4 - (future dates)   the metaverse and the mass market**\n\nWhen it comes to crypto, the mass market isn't hear yet. I don't think that will happen until the metaverse is much more established and very very accessible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What the heck does this have to do with trading cryptocurrency?\n\nEverything. You need to understand the fundamentals of the crypto market, as in... what are people actually buying.\n\nThe good news is, you are still very early which means there is plenty of money to be made. Being first pays big dividends. As a trader, you can ride the inevitable waves to come.\n\n**When it comes to crypto, what you are really investing in is this question:**\n\nWhich coins (or blockchains) are going to be used to purchase (or power) resources that consumers will value in the future?\n\neg.\n\nIf alt coin A can be used to purchase a house and is accepted by nearly every real estate broker as well as convertible into several gaming tokens... that's pretty useful.\n\nIf alt coin B can only be used in one online game and isn't convertible into anything else... not very useful\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now the field is wide open, there are hundreds of altcoins and several blockchain technologies. Eventually, over several years, as humanity always does, a trusted few will come out of it. Hopefully you will have guessed correctly with your portfolio.\n\nOver time I will post more on actual trading. I won't focus too much on fundamental analysis aside from this post, maybe what a project is and things on market adoption. For the most part I'll signpost or clarify aspects of technical analysis.\n\nHopefully some of it helps you on your journey.",

Does this mean users on binance with crypto-only anonymous accounts will be forced into KYC or only when the $1000 threshold has been crossed? I haven't heard any official responses from Binance or Bitfinex which are the 2 big exchanges that still allow anonymous accounts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[9 days until the crypto industry must verify the identity of anyone sending $1,000 or more](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/06/12/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-fatf-regulation/)",

Thank you all for your supportive comments!!**\n\n*below is old and from the original post*\n\n*UPDATE:*\n\nYou all are very helpful thank you for your reassurance and support! I have been trying to deposit my chargeback in USD today (tomorrow is the 7 day liquidation deadline) but I keep getting Deposit Failed alerts. This usually happens in Binance (sadly) so I'm hoping I can deposit later today like normal and its processed before anything in my account is liquidated\n\nMoreover I am afraid because I will now have x2 the amount of chargeback money just sitting in Binance, with a still frozen account possibly still going to be liquidated, with no signs of customer service. I have the money to cover my chargeback thats not the issue. The issue is I have no idea what's going on!!!\n\nThank you all again for your kindness!\n\n*UPDATE 2:* After several \"deposit failed\", I was finally able to deposit the chargeback amount in USD to Binance. Immediately after the amount was fulfilled, the USD disappeared from my Binance USD balance. So I assume this means the chargeback is fulfilled?\n\nBinance US - if you are watching. PLEASE turn my withdrawals and trading back on and confirm my chargeback deposit (I didnt get an email or anything acknowledging chargeback clearance, the amount just disappeared from my Binance USD account shortly after depositing) If you could confirm my ticket #678431 so I can be sure that'd be great. Thank you for all you do\n\nUPDATE 3: Just received an email from Binance saying my account is STILL not in good standing. I deposited $5000 USD today and it was promptly removed from my USD balance so I thought that covered the chargeback issue \u2013 what gives!?? I've created a new ticket ([\\#707305](https://support.binance.us/hc/requests/707305)) to get my withdrawals and trading turned back on. God help us. Thank you binance team for continuing to try\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE 4: THE NIGHTMARE CONTINUES \u2013** it appears the chargeback was successfully processed because my trading is turned back on. So I went to sell one of my coins and upon selling ALL OF THE PROFIT was completely removed from my account as soon as it became USD. It was more than $5200 in Bitcoin, completely removed from my account. No email, no notification. No nothing dude. Nothing.",

Its their money.\n\nIf you paid the chargeback they wont sell your coins to recoup the money. That email is just an automatic standard email after a chargeback is registered. It doesn't take anything into consideration other than that.\n\nif you paid it and its processed, you have nothing to worry about. Unfortunately to clear this, this typically takes like 6-8+ weeks from my own experience with the same issue, and what I have seen from others.\n\nHappened to me in January and I was freaking out as well. it will be OK. With any luck crypto will keep going up and by the time you cash out you'll be better off, and you wont make the mistake again.\n\nEven if someone prioritized your ticket and processed the chargeback right now, it can still take up to 3 days to get restored back to normal. there is probably no way whatsoever that you will get this fixed by Friday. Not trying to be an ass im just managing expectations.",

This worked for me 88% so far.\n\n\ud83d\udd18Don't engage in third party payment because it could be used against you and you lose funds. Make sure you stick to the available options that is stated on P2P. Never use third party account name to make payment when that isn't the name you bear on your Binance account.\n\n\ud83d\udd18Be polite to Ask for a positive feedback from both Maker & Taker after a successful transaction, the feedback helps alot for both parties, those nice positive comments works like magic towards increasing trade volume.\n\nGood communication brings about good understanding when transacting monetary value.

(From a Beginner) Since I thought of entering into crypto, I have some obstacles to cross in my way, which I will make you easy today.\n\nObstacle! I have money in my bank account in \u20b9 but I cannot buy crypto using \u20b9. So you need USDT/BNB/BTC/ETH/BUSD... For converting your Rupees into these currencies you can take help of P2P, Which is also known as Peer to Peer where you can transfer money to other person using (UPI/IMPS and more) and the other peer is going to release these currencies. \n\nIt's pretty easy in Binance! Just visit P2P section and select your currency and go into it. You can see hundreds of sellers if you are looking for buying and vice versa if you're trying to sell from your account. You can choose one peer from those options available which is suitable for you and proceed further and as soon as the process is complete. Your Rupees paid to the peer is converted into your wanted currency and now you can hold that currency if you want or you can Trade or futures or options or staking or anything / everything inside Binance App! \n\n\n\nI hope this helps many people to kickstart how to get your desired currency into your binance account through P2P.",

Make sure to communicate promptly on the chatbox provided before clicking RELEASE or TRANSFER NEXT once you have successfully received the payment/payment. (Check your email for the confirmation)\n\n4. Always take a screenshot of your PROOF of payment.\n\n5.FOLLOW BINANCE and read updates from time to time\n\n\nGodbless",

If the seller does not receive the fiat money, they will not release the coin. If you failed to indicate you have paid, the order will be cancelled and you might suffer a loss, so please always click on the \u201ctransferred\u201d button as soon as you pay. We have to do that because there are a lot of \u201ccoin lockers\u201d, they just click on buy but never pay, and the seller suffers because their asset is frozen till the order is cancelled.   \n\n\nIn case that mistake was made unintentionally, please contact our CS ASAP, we cannot guarantee we can get the asset back, but we will try our best to reach out to the other use to coordinate a voluntary return of crypto or fiat.",

What measures have been adopted by Binance to increase the safety of parties involved?\n\n2 Buyers currently look at 2 factors to select sellers - a) Trade success %, b) Number of Trades. This often makes it difficult for new genuine Sellers to step into P2P sellers zone as they lack both factors initially. How can you solve this issue and provide a stage where all genuine sellers can operate smoothly?\n\n3 We all know Bits and Pieces. From P2P management perspective, can you provide us tips to stay SAFU when we engage in P2P in Binance?\n\n4 Are the rates (let\u2019s say USDT) in P2P market monitored by any bodies? Or it is purely under discretion of Merchants and they are free to sell the dollars in any rate they would like? Don\u2019t you think, having the option of merchants controlling the price will impact Binance P2P business when the rates provided in Binance P2P are way too high compared to other exchanges? In other words, users always have the choice of transferring from other Exchanges.\n\n\nRecommendations\n\n1 Improve the Appeal resolution Turn-Around-Time. Currently there is a lag in TAT of appeal response and by the time the resolution is been made, most of the times the token we intended to buy went above the entry point.\n\n2 Seller identity verification (INR market). Similar to how Buyers are enforced to make transaction from a bank account with Buyer\u2019s name, Sellers should also be forced to use a UPI Id which should have their name shown up AS IS in seller list. Often there is a mismatch in both.\n\n3 Can we have a customer service through which users can reach out for emergency? With the nature of business, there are high probability that users need to speak to customer service on Real Time basis.\n\n4 In Future can we introduce some P2P insurance to safeguard funds and cover any major fraud instances?",

It's currently trading above the 4-hour 100-SMA, a support line which most of the other top coins (except Cardano) have failed to hold.\n\nBulls may soon attempt to break above the resistance trend line with initial resistance near $247, which is also the 50% retracement level from the recent swing high ($201) to swing low ($187). The hourly 100-SMA also indicates initial resistance near the $245 zone in the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nA clear break above the 245$ could push the [BNB USDT price](https://cryptopurview.com/binance-bnb-usd-price-live-chart/) higher and soon test the next resistance level at $265 and $280. A lot also depends on how [Bitcoin USD price](https://cryptopurview.com/live-price/) performs in the coming sessions.\n\n[BNB USDT live chart.](https://cryptopurview.com/binance-bnb-usd-price-live-chart/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9w4at3kjysj61.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=120bf90a57651462d913d4f4f7e1321ec702ee8c\n\n# Dips supported:\n\nIf [BNB USDT price](https://cryptopurview.com/binance-bnb-usd-price-live-chart/) breaches the support trend line (below $215 in the following sessions), the price could correct lower with initial support at $195. The 4-hour 100 simple moving average is also nearing $195. A breach below this key support level could pull down the BNB prices to $165.\n\n# Technical indicators:\n\n* Based on hourly price change, the MACD is gaining momentum and the [RSI of BNB/USD](https://cryptopurview.com/binance-bnb-usd-price-live-chart/) is also gaining strength.\n* Major support for [BNB/USDT pair](https://cryptopurview.com/binance-bnb-usd-price-live-chart/) is at $215, followed by $195.\n* Major resistance for BNB/USDT pair is at $245, $265, and $280.",

            "text": "I woud like here to point how BINANCE scammed me 1516 USD with some bullshit and unethical requests.\n\n**What happened?**\n\nOn 2019-12-20 I registered a binance account. I choosed to not verify my account as the limits of 2 BTC were more than enough for me!\n\nI deposited same day 0.21 BTC and sold it for USDT.\n\nSince I didn't use my account. On March 30 I logged in from a new computer. The system sent me an email to authorize the new device. This was done successfully.\n\nLater I tried to withdraw around 700 USD worth of BTC. The request was cancelled an the sytem asked me to verify my identiy. What???? What's the purpose of using unverified account????? So whenever I change my machine and login, I will have to submit my documents??\n\nMeanwhile I had some discussion with live support, who tried to help. Finally, I have been told that I have no other choice than doing the full verification. I decided then to do the verification which was done finally successfully.\n\nYou can see here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pkqhioutdfs41.png?width=493&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe4b632deb7d6d133d0894f6dfe1ac39b458b463\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spoke again with the support, they told me that I can try again, now that I'm fully verified, I can withdraw my funds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v0gddx81efs41.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbe27450f5a0a6247080be59d0c0f064c736eb55\n\nSo I tried again to withdraw some BTC, first the status for \"Waiting for approval\" then later it changed \"Rejected\" with  the info \"Withdraw rejected. Risk control\". What???\n\nI contacted again the support and I have been told that I will receive an email from Binance within few hours.\n\nAlmost 20hrs passed, nothing from Binance. So I opened a Ticket.\n\n u/ilir_binance  2821529 # is Ticket number for reference! Ticket was opened on 03/31/2020 (12 days ago by the time of writing this post).\n\nNext day I received an answer from Binance support. And look what these people are asking me:\n\n>Dear user,  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Thanks for reaching out,  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>We apologize for the delay in response due to the high volume of requests. As per checking, we found that the withdraw function was suspended due to the withdrawal risk control. We are willing to help you resume the withdrawal of your account. However, we may need some information to make progress.   \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Security questions:  \n>  \n>1. Account registration date  \n>  \n>2. Account registration IP  \n>  \n>3. Device information \n\nSo far this is not a problem to provide. I already provided this.\n\nFurthermore, they asked me to record a video :\n\n>A video of the first deposit you made to your Binance account. The video would contain the login process (do NOT show password) of the platform/wallet where you made this transaction to your Binance account, find the transaction and show us the full TxID, date and amount information. \n\nSeriously?????? These were parts of my answer to them, same day:\n\n>Hello guys,  \n>  \n>Thank you for your reply, but I'm sorry to say that what you are asking is absolutely unethical, but it's okay. Your Kingdom, Your rules. I'm happy to solve this issue, take out my money out and never use again your terrible exchange.  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>1. You wrote:  \n>  \n>\", please provide your withdrawal records and communication records with Binance CS\"  \n>  \n>Where the hell should I get communication records?? I had some chat with your support when my account got locked.  \n>  \n>But where the hell should I get these communications?? Are you kidding me?  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>You asked for my withdrawal records? Which ones??? One was rejected, the other was cancelled.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>So there was no withdrawal so far. So why are you asking something that does not exist??  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>3. And finally you wrote:  \n>  \n>\"A video of the first deposit you made to your Binance account. The video would contain the login process (do NOT show password) of the platform/wallet where you made this transaction to your Binance account, find the transaction and show us the full TxID, date and amount information. \"  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>My account was opened on the 20th December 2019!  \n>  \n>I made my first deposit on the same day, 0.21.. BTC.  \n>  \n>This has been now now more than 4 months!!!! How should I remember now which wallet I used by that time and what Transaction ID?  \n>  \n>Are you kidding me??????  \n>  \n>It was not a platform, I remember I used a wallet, but I dont remember which one anymore. I checked all my current wallets and I couldn't find this transaction.  \n>  \n>It was this transaction based on my deposit history:[https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/)....\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So they basically are asking me things that they know I can't provide and so would get a way to keep my money.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI asked them if it will be enough to provide anything else and close this case.\n\n>I will request then to withdraw all my coins and after that I will request you to close my account.  \n>  \n>I will never use again your service.  \n>  \n>I look forward to reading you soon, as we can close this case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Since there have been no answer from their support! I sent few email to remind them, there was simply no answer!**\n\nSo this was my last email to them, 5 days ago:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hryd3ghsefs41.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd853ce43499946e225dcbd2101fbc60c7efc24d\n\nStill today, I didn't get any answer.  \n\n\nI want to let everyone know about this. If this company is not a scam, I'm asking them to let me withdraw my money simply.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nr/Bitcoin r/BinanceExchange r/CryptoCurrency r/CryptoCurrencyTrading r/CryptoScam r/CryptoScamAlert r/CryptoScamsVictims",

I also never understood why people are so worried about KYC, it exist as a method for you to prove who you are ultimately. Will you prefer a bank that does no KYC? What happens if you lose your password to everything and all you have is your identity but then you did not do KYC. See the issue? I usually find little reason to not do KYC to protect my account. A millionaire or billionaire will definitely prefer KYC than no KYC.\n\nSecond issue is, you said there is no way you can remember which wallet you send your btc to Binance 4 months ago. Like for real? You have less than one btc. How many wallets do you have? 1000? You may have at most less than 10 wallets, it is not hard to establish which wallet you used and just login and prove with the txid record. The fact that you said you cannot prove this plus saying there is no way you can remember which wallet you send from as if there is no way for you to check, is HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS.\n\nAll of you ask yourself this, can you not know which wallet you did a transaction on 4 months ago? If you didnt know, are you not able to just check your wallets to locate the tx? Does this guy own a hedge fund with 20 departments and 200 employees with 10k wallets? Highly unlikely, go check the few wallets that you have and find the txid. If you cannot do so, it is likely something in your story is bullshit.\n\nWhat Binance is doing is justified since you hold a bullshit story. Your KYC prove nothing btw, it just prove the identity of the person that currently owns the account, it does not establish that you have been the owner since day 1. The only way to establish that is to request a video of the ownership of the original wallet that send the txid. They clearly suspect that you could be a hacker and stole the account.",

            "text": "**Prefix:** I've made this post in /r/CryptoCurrency and will sprinkle it around as many places as I can to be as visible as possible. With more people entering the crypto space every day I have a responsibility to not be too quiet about it. My whole journey started on reddit, so please do me a favour and read it if for nothing else than to just educate yourself.\n\nPlease be polite because this is brand new, and I'm still dealing with it.\n\n\\------\n\nSo, fanciful title aside, I don't really have much of an agenda going into this other than writing down the experience I've had over the last few weeks in one take and hoping it has the impact that I'm aiming it to. For me, this is some level of catharsis because I'm still dealing with my distorted sense of self - and journaling it, even in these first few sentences, is the calm my mind has needed for a while, if for nothing else just to heal.\n\n^(TL;DR - Bought crypto, made gains, moved to Binance, found futures - fucked mine.)\n\n**A note**:  \nCrypto is not foreign to me. While I may have been a new entrant in the 2021 market, I'm a software engineer by trade and have been aware of it since the very early days of Bitcoin. My first buy-in was back in 2017, and we all know how that went, so I've been nothing but cautious ever since. I knew the risks, I never put in more than I could afford, and I knew that if I just kept holding, it would usually (not always) come back around. None of these points were lost on me.\n\n**If you have had any previous trouble with addictions, even something as small as food, cigarettes, or alcohol, please read my story and take this as an extremely important lesson. I'll survive this, but I'm absolutely certain there's plenty more who can't, or won't, especially coming into a bullish alt season. If this post has any goal, it's to minimise the possibility of that happening, and keep any losses contained to a balance sheet.**\n\n*If you are an influencer or celebrity of any type, please make it very clear that when you're promoting cryptocurrency as an investment, there is quite a real possibility that people can slide into trading and by extension gambling. Some will lose their money, some will lose their sense of self, others will lose their lives. You have a responsibility to inform people of these risks when promoting them.*\n\n*I know that Elon frequents reddit, so please, just, take heed of this and don't let anyone find themselves where I did. Be more candid, it could make all of the difference.*\n\n# Me, a brief history\n\nAs stated, I'm a software engineer in his 30's that's worked hard to make sure I pulled myself out of a crappy childhood into the kind of life that I wished I was a part of when I was younger. I've got a house, a couple of kids, a wife, a dog - just all the trimmings that give you that general sense of completeness.\n\nThat doesn't mean I'm not without my flaws. For as long as I can remember I've battled an addictive personality on account of ADHD and other issues caused by a wide array of formative experiences. Alcohol, cigarettes, (soft) drugs, gambling, food, romantic escapades, and other thrill seeking behaviour was an every day occurrence for me when younger, ultimately causing me more harm than good.\n\nSince those days I've worked very hard to shut off that part of my life - seeking treatment and overcoming it. This is important to note, because I'm completely aware of the dangers associated with any of these behaviours, and I steer clear of any situation that may present itself that will push me back in front of that metaphoric freight train.\n\n# Enter, 2021\n\nI've had a decent 2020. Things went pretty bad during the first half, but I was able to really grind through the second half of the year and make sure that things were back on track and everyone in my life was looked after. I entered 2021 with a renewed sense of optimism and a great situation behind me, I'd really set the bar pretty high for what was to come, and there was no way I was going to let anything stand in my way.\n\nIn the midst of all of this, I'm a redditor. Have been for near-on a decade now (I change accounts frequently), and I like to spend a little (lot) of each day scrolling through and catching up on what's happening in the world, what's funny, and just engage in a bit of conversation or crack a few jokes.\n\nSo a few weeks ago we're all aware that WSB hit all time popularity due to the GME saga. It was thrilling, it was sticking it to wall street, it was everything that you love to see on the internet and a movement you could absolutely be a part of. Because of that, I bought my tickets - a couple of shares in GME. The excitement was off the charts, and I ultimately lost about a thousand bucks, but it was absolutely worth the price of admission. I feel like I'd made an actual impact and done something useful.\n\nOff the back of that movement (I'm sure you already know where I'm going with this), Dogecoin was propelled back into the spotlight and I thought yeah, you know what, Elon is talking about it, everyone's hyped about it, I'll YOLO a bit of money at it and see how it goes. At worst I have a bag of Doge, right? I can still use it, it's another little bit of fun to be had, and it'll scratch that crypto itch that I've been ignoring since the ring sting of 2017. Only this time I wont be making the same mistakes, or so I thought.\n\n# Gains gains gains!\n\nSo, Doge went nuts. I made about 3-4x what I initially threw in and once it started to stagnate I liquidated my position (only about 1.5x by that point) back into cash and thought okay, I've got some money in my wallet and a crypto journey I want to start. Let's get into it. So I did my research, found a few coins that I thought were really promising, and started buying them up.\n\nProblem is, a lot of the coins I wanted to purchase weren't available on the exchange that I was using. So with a bit of googling I found that Binance was likely the best place for me to be able to buy the coins that I'd decided I was going to put my money into. I signed up, transferred my funds, and started figuring out the interface. Being in the industry I love to poke around and see what it's made of, which is when I made the one discovery I'll live to regret: *futures trading*.\n\nYou see, for the uninitiated: futures trading is gambling. There's no real other way to cut it, but it's gambling. You're risking what you have by borrowing what you don't in the pursuit of earning a multiplier rather than just purchasing an asset, so the risk is off the charts. Being that I'd had no stock market experience and had no idea what it was, I thought it really was just a neat trading tool. I had a play around with it and instantly I was hooked. I had no idea how anybody could lose using this. It made me feel like the most badass trader around - sitting in front of my high-tech console with all my graphs, making longs and shorts, green indicators everywhere, it was an absolute wonder.\n\n# Knowing the market, trusting what you see\n\nThis was mistake #2. This sub, a few other subs, and social media are absolutely flooded with gains porn, advice on the market, information on what to invest in, and when to invest it. A lot of it is super helpful advice and if you're well versed in the internet it's easy enough to filter out the shills and make your own decision after researching what you've read.\n\nProblem is that I had no idea the market conditions and how that can really influence your investment, especially if futures trading. I knew that there could be a bullish or bearish market, what each of those things meant, and I knew that it would go up and down, so look out for certain things on graphs and other indicators.\n\nOne thing I didn't know much about is liquidation prices, margins, and how much things could go south by something as small as BTC rallying (turns out alts get hit pretty hard), new money flooding the market, whales putting up price walls and manipulating buys/sells, and just how fast all of those things could destroy my position.\n\n# The loss of it all\n\nWhen you get addicted to something, all of the dopamine in your brain is telling you to do it again, do it more, take more risk, and everything else that you know not to be true - it's just true in that moment. Because the market was doing so well I was duped into thinking that *I* was doing well, that *I* was some masterful trader and had it all figured out, and I started to increase those positions and decrease margins, because the gains were even bigger that way. By this point, I had enough balance to cover what I put into coins originally + what I wasted on the WSB fiasco. That was absolutely perfect and I was going to take it out and put it back in the family bank, but I wanted to make another trade, just *one* more. This coin I'm confident about is breaking out and I want to at least walk away with some profit after all was said and done.\n\nWell, that was the moment I learned that things can take a turn very quickly, and a liquidation event won't just ***reduce*** your position, it will completely wipe anything you have left + the margins. I locked my phone, attended to something around the house, opened my phone to look again, and there it was:\n\nNothing.\n\nNo trade, no balance, just nothing. The price had dipped below the liquidation point and unbeknownst to me it was all over just like that. Now, just like I said before, I never risked or put in what I couldn't afford to lose, and it was a completely avoidable mistake had I known more about it, but that's where things really started to fuck me up.\n\n# How could I have been so stupid?\n\nThis is where it starts to take a turn, because it really starts to play on your sense of self when you make a mistake that big due to not knowing. Losing it all on a big gamble, taking a known risk, any of those things - you can handle the loss. You were prepared for it, you set yourself up for it, you made that conscious choice to put yourself out there in that way and you didn't win. It sucks, but that's okay, you can handle it.\n\nThis move wasn't that. This move was a complete and utter fuck up due to my lack of knowledge and understanding. Accidentally finding myself gambling and being unaware of it was bad enough, but losing it all like that so suddenly when I planned to dip out of the position if it went too poorly really shook me to the core. I had *plans* for that money, I was going to *do* things with that money. These are just some of thoughts that start swirling through your mind in the moment and you feel like you've deprived yourself and the people around you of that opportunity by being an idiot. But it's okay, you're not an idiot, you just made a mistake.\n\n# Let's add more money, make it all back\n\nThis is the point that I was in too deep but had no idea. By this point, about a week in, trading had completely consumed me and my days/nights/interactions with family, my relationship with friends was thinned, I was irritable, I was distracted, I was always watching the market. I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating well, all I could watch and feel were my trades. I had to baby them, otherwise they wouldn't work. I was obsessive over all my moves, all of my positions, all of my research - the works.\n\nOnly to me it had happened so gradually that I didn't even recognise that I was all the way down that hole. I didn't realise how consumed I'd become or how bad things had gotten because I'd just slowly and willingly walked into it all thinking it was completely innocent when it was anything but, so when I got to the point of losing that chunk of money, I thought I'd just made a minor mistake and because my trades were already so good, and I could make that back in a second.\n\nSo, stupidly and regretfully, I pulled a large sum of money out of my credit card and slapped it into my wallet. I was going to make back what I lost, make up for my stupid mistake, take it all out, and call it a day. I'd flown too close to the flames and I just wanted to make my exit quietly and gracefully, pretend it never happened and move on.\n\nBut it didn't happen like that.\n\n# The final moments\n\nIn order to make back what I'd lost, I retook the same position that I'd lost on in the first place. I thought it was a winning position, and honestly in the long run it really is. If I had more money, more time, and more knowledge, it would have - but I didn't have any of those things. I put the money right back in to where I made the mistake, vowing not to make it again now that I was armed with the knowledge of what to do, and started again.\n\nSo earlier in the story I talked about BTC rallying and alts dropping rapidly, then whales smelling blood in the water and forcing others to panic sell / trigger stop losses / trigger liquidations, then gobbling up all that remains on the cheap. This is the point in my story where I learned all of those things happen. In order to prevent bleeding out and dying entirely I had to keep reducing my position when possible, and topping up my margin. It went lower, so I had to weather it. I was too deep to sell my position and take the loss, I just had to make sure I didn't bleed out - it was going to swing back up, right? It always has.\n\nThat's where I was wrong. It didn't. Every time it went lower I had to sell off a portion and bolster my margins. I lost more, and more, and more, until eventually I had 1/4 of what I had left. At this point I was in too deep, so I vowed again to learn my mistakes, and use this money to slowly and incrementally make back what I'd lost that time.\n\nBut the market got worse, and I was caught completely unaware in a storm that I couldn't even comprehend. I was a man in a tin boat in the middle of a tsunami. It was all lost. That was it, it was over.\n\nOnce all was said and done, I'd lost around $20,000 USD.\n\n# The mind is more important than the pocket\n\nThis is I guess where I get to the core message, and the lesson that I want people to learn from where I'm sitting.\n\nFirst of all, losing money is bad no matter how you cut it. Some people will go into this investing way more than they can afford to lose, and some people will keep it small. Some people, like me, will small but end up losing way more than they need to. It will take a while for me to recover, but it won't ruin my life. Either way, it's a very hard lesson to learn just on that front.\n\nSecondly is your sense of self, sanity, and reality. Now to me this is the absolute most important lesson to learn of them all. You can very easily find yourself down the rabbit hole and not even know you're there, just as I did. You can be in too deep, destroying your bank balance and everyone around you, and justify it because you've so gradually moved into it that it's all part of your plan. Sort of like the frogs in a boiling pot analogy. By the time you've noticed it's always going to be way too late, and by that point the damage is near irreparable.\n\n# Where I'm at, and the future\n\nFor me this only ended within the last few days, so I'm still processing how I even found myself here, and how to move forwards. Writing this out is helpful because it's allowing me to process and learn from my own mistakes as I go along.\n\nUltimately I've cost my family a lot of money, I've cost myself some opportunities both cash-wise and coin-wise (I have a grand total of zero of the coins that I planned to keep as investments), and I'm dealing with some existential problems that have shaken me so horribly I'm in the middle of a mental breakdown. Don't get me wrong, I'm writing this all very logically and reasonably, but the amount that I'm struggling to comprehend how I ended up here, and the sheer scale of loss, is just making my question my entire self right to the core.\n\nBut that's the lesson I want people to learn. It doesn't matter so much about the money, the opportunity, or anything else that you may lose if you find yourself on the losing side of a bad situation. It's about the mental toll and how you'll react to that, how you'll see yourself, how you'll see the world around you and the pain you'll have to go through as a result of it.\n\nI'll heal. Slowly. Time will get me there, but as a part of that I want to try and limit anyone else entering this market afresh from making the same mistakes that I did. Part of that is telling my story, and the other part is hoping that we can make people more aware that futures/margin trading is gambling. If you have an addictive personality, stay away from it. If you're encouraging people to get into crypto, make sure it's known.\n\nIf I'd have known, maybe I'd be having a different time right now. But, honestly, it's hell. Through the tears, self-berating, and intrusive harmful thoughts, I just wish I could have picked it. I've been through it all before and I can avoid these situations pretty successfully, and yet it *still* caught me with my pants down. That's something that's hard to accept no matter who you are.\n\nIt can happen to you, too. No matter how smart you are, no matter what you've been through, and no matter what you know.\n\nJust, don't be me. It'll torture you forever. If nothing else let me take that one for the team.\n\nQuestions are welcome. Take care out there.",

I'll have enough money to take my family, even the parents,... one can imagine. Then came the crash, I couldn't pull myself out from watching the price and pushing it up with my eyes, couldn't sleep well, couldn't eat well, lost a few kgs in a week. Money kept going away and then I pulled the plug at a small loss. I consider myself lucky one as I hadn't lost money in this, but I definitely stressed more than the last few years of my life combined. Plus, losing even potential gains hurts a lot - why I had to be so greedy? Why I couldn't take those few thousand profits and walk away? Why I was expecting for it to moon? Well, I definitely learned a lot. Still play with crypto, but I'm doing it much more carefully - buy, hold & take small profits out until at least half the money I put into it can I put out and still have some long term investment.",

            "text": "This is why you should invest in Binance's BnB while it's still early. Do your own research and you decide if it has the potential to take over the crypto exchange market. \n\n\"CEO - Changpeng Zhao is a true visionary in cryptocurrency. Great pro-active team supported with Hongfei Da - Antshares/NEO CEO founder. Expect more developments on their platform in coming months. One of their edge is multi language platform (Eng, Japanese, Korean, Chinese) opening windows to asian traders which is a huge gigantic market. Check their official website & youtube team videos. With only 100,000,000 circulating supply, this coin will definitely have a decent market value.\" -Xtian Est\n\nI've done a tremendous amount of research since I've invested around the $.20 range and I've listed quite a few things you should take into consideration.\n\nUse case #1:\nBinance recently announced they're creating their own eco system for their very own high impact ICO Platform. These ICOs will be funded with BnB. This is smart because it attracts new users to join Binance and buy BnB. \nCheck out TRON while you're at it https://www.binance.com/ico.html\n\nUse case #2:\nBnB will also serve as a gas on the decentralized exchange in the future. \n\nUse case #3:\nBnB gives you a 50% discount on fees. You cut your trading fees in half while holding onto BnB. Here is the bonus, not only do you save in fees but you ALSO grow your capital as BnB rises in value. You are getting a two for one here! \n\nUse case #4:\nBinance will buy back tokens from the open market and burn 100 million supply which will essentially drive the value up - supply and demand 101.  \n\nUse case #5:\nBinance has made a bold statement by stamping their name on the Binance BnB coin and making it the face of their company. This shows their confidence in the value of their product they are wanting consumers to buy and use. It is also my belief that the company's success or failure will reflect the market value of the coin. Binance will also add margin trading, futures, and additional utility to the BnB coin.\n\nFunds Usage\n\n\u25cf 35% of the funds will be used to build the Binance platform and perform upgrades to the system, which includes team recruiting, training, and the development budget.\n\n\u25cf 50% will be used for Binance branding and marketing, including continuous promotion and education of Binance and blockchain innovations in industry mediums. A sufficient budget for various advertisement activities, to help Binance become popular among investors, and to attract active users to the platform.\n\n\u25cf 15% will be kept in reserve to cope with any emergency or unexpected situation that might come up.\n\nIt is quite obvious that Binance plans to stay on top of their game. Marketing and growing the community is one of their main goals: https://binance.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000483751--Calling-for-Binance-Angels\n\nConclusion:\nWhen was the last time you actually invested in an alt coin with intrinsic value that you could use on a live platform without investing into speculation? BnB is one of the few coins that has real usage and backed by an infrastructure that already supports the utility and value of it. \n\nBinance is changing the way traditional crypto exchanges have operated in the past. They GIVE BACK to their users and provide a sense of ownership. When was the last time you felt like you had a \"stake\" with an exchange? When was the last time you felt like you were surrounded by a team of members who genuinely cared about the community and made customer service their #1 priority? If you don't believe me come check out their slack channel and get to know the CEO @CZ Changpeng Zhao and awesome staff members ( u/steve_bnb ) who have been extremely helpful and quick to answer our questions. I could go on forever but it's clear that Binance is out to destroy their competition. \n\nDon't forget to look at their investors and the teams portfolio. Founders of NEO invested into Binance which is how they were able to quickly get NeoGas trading on their exchange (https://binance.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000608671-Binance-Open-Letter-to-NEO-Community). The founder and co-founder of Binance also came from OKCoin, one of the most successful bitcoin markets.\n\nCheck out the white paper and team video below.\n\nBinance White paper\nhttps://www.binance.com/resources/ico/Binance_WhitePaper_en.pdf\n\nArchived Binance ICO page:\nhttps://www.binance.com/ico_review_en.html\n\nBinance team video\nhttps://youtu.be/2yIxA8nmEjs\n\nBinance ICO video\nhttps://youtu.be/lZKHAxsKNDk\n\nCurrently Ranked #25 on Coinmarketcap with $227 Million market cap (as of 08/18/2017) https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/binance-coin/\n\nSocial media:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/binance_2017?lang=en\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/binance2017/\n\nhttps://binance.slack.com/join/shared_invite/MjI3NzUzMjM0ODk5LTE1MDI5NTc3MDctY2EzZTQ5YjIxNQ\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.newsbtc.com/2017/08/17/binance-remarks-cryptocurrency-industry-build-new-echo/\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/gallery/kiEd2\n\nhttp://www.binance.com\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/assets/binance-coin/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/6toi48/here_are_the_links_to_the_binance_white_paper_and/?st=J6I6YQ7O&sh=ccc42a32",

If they are using the symbols as keys, it might actually be quite difficult for them to make the change from BCC to BCH.

It has experienced significant enough growth, and has a following. Presently, HitBTC & Bittrex support this currency, however, HitBTC is not reputable, and Bittrex is closed to new accounts, so people are not able to trade XDN effectively. This situation would give your exchange an advantage by making a market in XDN, with potentially increasing transaction fees for your business. I would be trading for XDN on your exchange if you carried it.\n\nThank you,",

            "text": "Binance.com launched on July 14th, 11 days after its ICO which raised $15m, is on its way to become the premiere NEO based ICO platform, especially in China. In roughly two months, I believe it ranked once coinmarketcap.com top 10 exchanges by 24 hour volume. The futuristic exchange received VC funding from Blackhole Capital and Funcity Capital. I'm a b-schooler with fin/econ focus, so I have been forced to learn that **fundamentals matter** in the long run. For the same reason, I'm a big NEO fan as well and have a few NEOs. I looked at CZ led Binance team and Binance's business model. The team have excellent track record having affiliation with industry leaders. Entirely new to crytospace, I went pretty much all in at much higher than current price. I don't regret cancelling my sell order at 69k sats; not because I believe BNB will rise, but because I learnt about markets. I witnessed Binance team strategically handling this current Chinese bitcoin/bitcoin exchanges/ICOs ban news/FUDs. That's another story. Binance is the first community I'm kind of active and this happens to be my first post. This is a just a summary of what I found elsewhere (see references, official stats announcement):\n\n### Binance as a business\nTotal supply is **200M**. 20% of Binance.com's quarterly profits will be used to **buy-and-destroy** BNB tokens, eventually leaving 100M in constant circulation. Binance's already lower than industry average (0.2%) trading fees reduce to only **0.05% when paid in BNB**. It's one of the rarest tokens that provide real-life utility. This is their discounted fee schedule:\n\n| Period (year) |  1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th+ |\n| ----------------- |:-------:| :-----: | :------: |:-------:| :-----:|\n|**Discount** | 50% | 25% | 12.5% | 6.75% | 0%|\n\n\nForget about BNB's plan to build a decentralized exchange in which BNB will be used as GAS. For now I try to estimate, or guesstimate or yet better, daydream about BNB's actual demand in coming years. Assume a *risk-premium* (amount above valuation) though, for BNB might actually be the fuel of the planet's most powerful decentralized exchange.\n\n### Assumptions and valuation\nStatisticians assume a lot of things, usually in their favor. I'm too assuming things about BNB: \n\n * **24h volume now 15k BTC**. I'm being optimistic and ignoring current slowdown (to 9k BTC) due to Chinese ICO related news/FUDs. I'm not sure if BNB actually hit top ten exchanges, documented highest it reached is #12 with ~15k BTC.\n * **A steady 0.5% weekly increase in volume** which seems likely based on how Binance is growing. It currently lists only a select few coins/tokens. Volume will increase as more coins are added. Cryptospace in genereal is increasing. So 15k daily trade, which increases 0.5% weekly for four years (~400 weeks). The volume sure will have at some point have an upper bound, but Initial burst will be more than 0.5%. So things balance out.\n\n\n    15000 * (1.005^400) = ~110k\n\n\n\nOnly Bittrex and Bitfinex have crossed that 100k+ daily volume milestone. Binance has to be of course **one of the be global leaders and and ahead of OKcoin.cn**, in order for the valuation to hold. It seems daunting, but I think is possible. For the sake of simplicity, I shamelessly generalized calculations and used round numbers. Since BNB provides utility entitling users to pay discounted fees, any rational user would grab the opportunity. I hope Binance has a **50k BTC daily volume, on average, in the next four years**. Though discount will be decreasing over time, I assume only **0.05% fees in the entire period**. The calculation does not include demands for deposits/withdrawals/listings/ICOs that will use Binance platform.\n\n\n    trading_fees * volume * days / total_supply = price/BNB\n    0.0005 * 50000 * 1500 / 200000000 = 0.0001875\n\n**BNB is valued at roughly 37500 BTC (~150M USD), putting BNB at ~ $0.7.** This is probably an undervaluation. See notes.\n\n\n### Notes\n * Being traded in only one exchange, it bears whale manipulation impact (-). In the long run real users will take control of the market.\n * Calculation didn't take into account 100M BNB buy-backs (+)\n * Calculation ignored demands for BNB other than trading fees (+)\n *  Possibility of owning a piece of first real, user-friendly, bug-free decentralized exchange in the ever growing decentralized world hasn't been considered (+)\n * Whatever BNB's residual value (after four years) is, jokingly though, zero in the calculation (+)\n * Discounts will decrease gradually, but here current 50% discount has been assumed for four years (+)\n * **It's a BNB-BTC evaluation (since fees paid in BTC, not USD) and we all know BTC is gonna rise anyway, so impact on BNB-USD will be HUGE (+)**\n\n\n### References\nhttps://www.binance.com/resources/ico/Binance_WhitePaper_en.pdf\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/binancecom-ico-experience-lessons-advices-changpeng-zhao?articleId=6287572792573599744\nhttp://www.newsbtc.com/2017/09/03/binance-raises-vc-investment/\nhttps://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/binance.com\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/volume/24-hour/all/\nhttps://binance.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001292531-Binance-com-Stats-2017-8-27\n\n\n### To BNB team\nCongrats! You've smartly handled this recent tsunami, which unfortunately happened to be just when you started. Take it as an opportunity and prove that YES, IT'S POSSIBLE. BNB's success depends on your success.\n\n### Correction\n*There are ~200 weeks in four years, not ~400. Because I couldn't include some obviously positive variables in valuation and since final number makes sense, I'm leaving it as it is. Binance is going to have the assumed 50k volume soon anyway, I hope.*",

            "text": "**TL;DR:** I know a boring, virgin-tier amount about financial conduct, and I'm going to make the case that as a Barclays customer you have a very solid mandate to challenge their recent embargo on Binance. Failure to uphold your complaint will place them in violation of the FCA's regulations, specifically the Banking Conduct of Business Sourcebook, which typically triggers fines enumerated in tens or hundreds of millions of GBP.   \n\n\nAt the bottom of this post I will provide an example complaint you can send them, how to go about submitting it, what I expect it to achieve and what you should do next when they inevitably claim innocence. Read the whole post or just skip to the action - your choice. If you find this helpful please upvote for visibility.   \n\n\n\\---------------------  \nTHE LONG VERSION  \n\\---------------------\n\nAll financial service providers in the UK are authorised and regulated by a series of independent governing bodies. The main one to be aware of in this case is the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority). The FCA's goal is to ensure that service providers such as Barclays, who hold enormous power over their customers' money and affairs, aren't able to manipulate matters to their advantage. \n\nThe FCA handbook is some 30,000 pages long - about three times the length of the combined works of Shakespeare - so today we're going to zero in on a couple of key points:   \n\n\n\\- The FCA's eleven guiding principles (the TL:DR version of the FCA handbook);  \n\n\n\\- BCOBS - the Banking Conduct of Business Sourcebook.   \n\n\nThe FCA handbook is horrifying long and complicated, but EVERYONE who works in financial services is required to understand it at a basic level. Everyone. Right down to the lowliest data entry monkey. The FCA therefore quite neatly condenses the whole 30,000 pages into eleven guiding principles, allowing even someone totally new to the industry to take a stab at whether a given action seems \"wrong\" or \"right\". I'm going to list the ones that Barclays has violated in the order I believe they apply (not numerical order):   \n\n\n\\- #11:  **Conflicts of interest**\n\n\"A firm must manage conflicts of interest fairly, **both between itself and its customers** **and between a customer and another client.\"**  \n\n\nIt is self-evident that traditional finance providers (Tradfi) are in direct competition with crypto and decentralised finance providers (DeFi). They are, quite literally, providing the same services. It therefore follows that OUTRIGHT BANNING transferring funds to a competitor is equivalent to outright banning customers from moving their funds from Barclays to HSCB or Natwest. It violates both the FCA regs and broader antitrust / anti-competition laws, which apply to every industry (not just financial services). Even if I only sell ice cream I can't ban people from using the ice cream shop next door. I will go to jail and forfeit all my assets.   \n\n\n\\-  #**6: Customers\u2019 interests**\n\n\"A firm must pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly.\"   \n\n\nTreating customers fairly (TCF) typically refers to things like treating all customers the same - e.g. I can't decline to offer you a mortgage because of your race or sexual orientation. But \"the interests of its customers\" also encompasses financial interests. Bitcoin is the best-performing asset class of the last decade. To wilfully prevent customers from accessing it is axiomatically harmful to their interests. Furthermore, note that TCF emphasises \"treating people the same\" - \"one rule for all\". In this case, Barclays permits funds transfers to gambling providers and traditional investment vehicles (rocks and stocks). When cryptoassets have empirically, provably, outperformed these same vehicles over a ten-year stretch (it is clearly not anomolous) - THE ONUS IS ON BARCLAYS TO DEMONSTRATE WHY it has decided to treat these asset classes, and the customers who deal in them, in radically different ways. I cannot stress this enough - unlike criminal law where one is innocent until proven guilty, in financial regulation the balance of fairness must always lie with the individual, not the service provider. I.e.: when challenged by the FCA, Barclays must be able to hand over a book of evidence as to why its customers need protection from the top-perfoming asset class and not, for example, from purchases in casinos, or of tobacco or alcohol.   \n\n\n\\- To a lesser extent - points #1 and #7, which are, respectively -   \n\n\n**Communications with clients**\n\nA firm must pay due regard to the information needs of its clients, and communicate information to them in a way which is clear, fair and accurate.  \n\n\nIt follows that Barclays is not communicating a clear information picture to clients, and must provide evidence to support its picture that the harm from a top-performing asset class exceeds that of lesser-performing asset classes such as stock and rocks. To put a crude turn on it, it appears Barclays has \"lied\" about its motivations. The onus is on it to prove otherwise.   \n\n\nAnd,   \n\n\n**Integrity**\n\nA firm must conduct its business with integrity.   \n\n\nPerhaps the hardest of the eleven rules to interpret - but a failure on any of the above would provide the basis for a lack-of-integrity claim.  \n\n\n  \n**Now let's take a look a BCOBS, the Banking Conduct Sourcebook.**  \n\n\nThe FCA's rules have to cover a huge spectrum of products and services, so they have to be flexible at the wide end. That's why we see statements like \"conduct yourself with integrity\". As we drill down into different industries, we start to get very empirical rulesets that apply specifically to that product or service. BCOBS is the bible for banking businesses like Barclays.   \n\n\nBCOBS weighs in at a mere 152 pages, and I'm sure you'd love to read the whole thing, but the part I'd like to draw attention to is BCOBS 5 - a bank's obligations to customers after the \"point of sale\" (after the point you've chosen them as your bank and opened an account with them):   \n\n\n**5.1.5:  A firm must provide a prompt and efficient service to enable a banking customer to move to a retail banking service (including a payment service) provided by another firm.**    \n\n\nBinance is not a retail banking service, but as a provider of VISA debit cards IT IS A PAYMENT SERVICE. Barclays therefore MUST provide a prompt and efficient service to you when you want to transfer funds to Binance. An outright block on a competitor can hardly be considered to meet the criteria.  \n\n\nBarclays may well argue that in fact they're complying with 5.1.10A R, which states they have to take due care to protect you from accidentally moving your account to a fraudulent service. But in fact:   \n\"this means such procedures should include authentication procedures for the verification of the identity of the banking customer or the validity of the use of a particular payment instrument, proportionate to the risks involved. Where appropriate, firms may wish to consider the adoption of \u2018strong customer authentication\u2019, as defined in the Payment Services Regulations, and specified in the SCA RTS.\"\n\nIn other words, Barclays' obligation is not to try to control where you send your money, but just to conduct basic due diligence to ensure it is indeed you making the transfer, and that the service you wish to transfer TO has the appropriate regulatory checks and approvals in place. Binance (not Binance UK yet) does hold these licenses and therefore their duties are amply met.   \n\n\nWe could continue in this vein for some time, but I'm conscious most readers won't even make it this far. So let's cut to the action.   \n\n\n\\-----------------------------------------  \nTHE ACTION - WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT?  \n\\-----------------------------------------  \n\n\nBy this point you've either read and agreed with the arguments presented above, or decided that anyone who knows THIS MUCH about UK financial regulations can't possibly have enough of a sense of humour to be pranking you. So let's assume you're ready to challenge Barclays illegal conduct.   \n\n\nThe first thing you should do is submit a complaint here.   \n\n\n[https://www.barclays.co.uk/help/making-a-complaint/how-do-i-make-a-complaint/](https://www.barclays.co.uk/help/making-a-complaint/how-do-i-make-a-complaint/)  \n\n\nYou can write your own, or here's a draft complaint you can use in full or in part.   \n\n\n\\-----------------------------------  \nEXAMPLE COMPLAINT  \n\\------------------------------------  \n\n\n\"Dear Sir / Madam,   \n\n\nI'm writing to complain in the strongest possible terms about Barclays' recent decision to prohibit UK customers from making transfers to Binance.   \n\n\nI strongly believe you are not acting in your customers' best interests in doing so, and are therefore in violation of points 11, 6, 7 and 1 of the FCA's 11 guiding principles. \n\nDecentralised finance providers are an alternative to traditional banking services like yours, and to outright ban customers from moving funds from their Barclays account to another financial service provider is anticompetitive and demonstrates a clear conflict of interests (point 11). It is equivalent to preventing a customer moving their funds from Barclays to another bank, and therefore also puts you in clear contravention of BCOBS 5.1.5.  \n\n\nThe reason you have given for doing so is to \"protect customers\", but decentralised assets have demonstrably provided the best return on investment for the last decade. That is not an opinion - it is empirically provable and beyond doubt, whatever your own subjective views on whether financial authority ought to be concentrated in the hands of the few or the many. Therefore, you are either willfully ignorant of the perfomance of the markets for the last decade, putting you in contravention of FCA principles 2 and 3; or, you have another motive not disclosed in your communications to customers, and are in breach of principles 6, 7, 8 and 1.   \n\n\nRegardless, the onus is now on you to justify why you allow customers to purchase lower-performing assets such as stocks, or higher-risk instruments such as sports bets, and not decentralised assets. You are clearly required to treat customers fairly and equally, yet you allow more harmful transactions while prohibiting those which - purely coincidentally, I'm sure - compete directly with your own. \n\nThe best possible outcome for you in this scenario is that your customers desert you in droves for your more progressive competitors, of which there are countless. An equally likely scenario is that complaints such as these reach the eyes of the regulators and you are handed a fine enumerated in seven or eight figures. The FCA, as you are no doubt aware, \"fines to hurt\" firms such as yourselves. With \u00a31.3tn under management, a \"hurtful fine\" for you would be rather eyewatering. A third outcome  is that in trying to fight the tide of technological progress you inevitably get left behind. For a bank that has survived over 300 years, from the steam engine to the internet, it seems rather sad that the one innovation you couldn't understand would be a new and popular way of exchanging value between people and businesses. Nonetheless, the choice is yours to make.   \n\n\nThe only satisfactory resolution of this complaint will be the reversal of your short-sighted ban on cryptoasset exchanges like Binance. Please do consider it carefully and with an open heart and mind.   \n\n\nYours, a previously loyal Barclays customer.   \n\n\n\\-------------------------------------------  \nAND FINALLY.....  \n\\--------------------------------------------  \n\n\nWhat do I do if Barclays decide to fob me off?   \n\n\nOne of the great things about regulated industries is that, if your financial service provider can't resolve your complaint to your satisfaction, you can escalate it to an independent third party who will help to mediate. These guys are called the Ombudsmen. Barclays will legally have to tell you about this option if they don't uphold your complaint and overturn their ban.   \n\n\nNot only do the Ombudsmen take these matters very seriously, they also charge Barclays for the priviledge. It's expensive and time-consuming to unpick these complaints, so every time one lands on their desk, they charge the service provider a fee to cover their costs. There's therefore a phenomenon whereby EVEN IF BARCLAYS REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THIS, if enough people complain and escalate, it just becomes too financially painful for them not to. Kinda like a short squeeze, I guess.   \n\n\nI hope this is useful to our friends in the UK, and I urge you to take the fight to Barclays and stand up for what you believe in. If Barclays get away with it, who's next?   \n\n\nRespectfully  \n\n\nMeowface the cat.",

I have learned there is an ongoing Phishing attempt where when sending out a transaction you might see a page asking you to perform a \"Security Update\" This leads to a phishing site where you will be asked to download a malicious program which once installed somehow steals the seed & password from Electrum wallet and wipes it clean.

Some of you or many of you will still know there is this game called \"Free Bitcoin Hash\" and \"Free Litecoin\". Well my journey starter there and many of you are probably starting laugh, but the start of a journey is always ridiculous. At that time I was still 17 (basically a minor and you probably know how it is). \n\nWell I earned at that time through only bitcoin hash 3\u20ac and I converted in July 2020 in Binance without knowing really what it was... Well than I started playing with Litecoin and I guess I earned very little cant remember the amount. I deposited everyhting in Binance. What happend next, I forgot completely about crypto and my \"little\" money. Then it came to my mind sometime in january 2021, while I was studying for a math test. My investment was already worth 20\u20ac. Welll I kept going and got verified at Binance in january 2021 (I turned there 18). In the same time parents got me my first debit card and they gifted me 50\u20ac. Well on the same day I deposited everything in Binance and converted in BNB coin. Well Right now I am sitting here with Binance Coin, Litecoin and Doge coin and profiting alot.\n\nProbably many of you are thinking this isnt alot of money, but my journey has been so far really life changing stuff and the age is on my side. I guess I can be a success story here and I hope I can keep learning from you redditors like I have done so far. \n\nFun fact: my parents know nothing about this\ud83d\ude02.",

            "text": "Dear Binance Team,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn this research report -> [https://research.binance.com/en/projects/btcst](https://research.binance.com/en/projects/btcst)\n\nit says that Binance has a partnership with BTCST, and quote:\n\n\"will form a governance board that collectively decides on material issues of the project, which include new token issuances, cost level adjustments, surplus profit distribution, and future development. The governance board will have three seats upon launch, two of which to be occupied by the project team and one by the partnering mining pool.\"\n\nDue to this Binance partnership and the fact that the project launched on Binance Launchpool, many investors had confidence in this project and bought their t-assets.\n\ntBTC is now only worth 0.26 BTC. Additionally the project has introduced a 30% tax on sales and token transfers, so that holders are not able to get out without losing an additional 30% of their value.\n\nAccording to the Tau asset white paper (Source: [https://www.btcst.finance/static/Tau-Whitepaper.pdf](https://www.btcst.finance/static/Tau-Whitepaper.pdf)):\n\n\"To synthesize a \u03c4Assets, the \u03c4 protocol requires the staking of hashrate tokens collateralized by the relevant PoW hashrate and the forgoing of PoW rewards in return for the synthetic versions. For example, synthesis of \u03c4Bitcoin would require synthetic mining with hashrate tokens collateralized by standardized Bitcoin hashrate. The combination of staking with the relevant PoW hashrate and the surrendering of PoW rewards represent hashrate consumption, imparting inherent value into the resultant synthetics.\n\nThe forgone mining rewards will be reserved for open market repurchases of \u03c4Assets, if necessary, as discussed below\"\n\nThe team ignores questions regarding these forgone mining rewards and repurchases that should have taken place. That's why many investors now believe that the collateral never existed in the first place and that the repurchases have not taken place.\n\nAdditionally by now the mechanism has been changed to the above-mentioned 30% fee.\n\nWhat's worse is that the BTCST Telegram community is full of bots, and it seems only one admin has access to the project team. They have promised updates and an AMA for weeks now, but keep the community in the dark about their strategy to re-peg the t-assets. Additionally they ignore all critical questions by investors, or even ban or limit them which further diminishes investors' trust. Due to these factors the asset is losing more peg daily, and some investors do fear that what they are experiencing is a slow rug.\n\nThere cannot be found any information about the CEO Alex Zhao or any other team members online which makes many investors doubt if they exist at all.\n\nMy questions to Binance are:\n\n1. Can you please shed some light on the level of partnership that you have with BTCST and on which levels you cooperate?\n2. Which Due-Diligence has been done before launching BTCST on Binance Launchpool and entering into further partnerships with them?\n3. Did the BTCST team have to follow KYC-procedures before being launched on Binance Launchpool?\n\nThanks!",

Supporters of decentralization say that this undermines the whole idea of   digital assets, which is that such assets should be decentralized and should not be controlled by anyone.\n\nIt's interesting to see how Ripple will develop in the coming years.

His words mean that the company is looking to diversify and become more visible in the digital economy. Indeed, Ripple has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in projects aimed at boosting blockchain use.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nwcbwht824w61.jpg?width=1472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d7e7731e63f8c6641f424766302759d8518f0e92",

As well as everyone on Binance chain being able to talk to enterprises resulting in more customers for both parties, but also allows Binance chain to use Ripple, Ethereum, EOS etc through Overledger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecommend you watch the entire video (is long but lots of information that explains the scale of this project). Overview of some of the main points below with time stamps so you can refer to the video. Blockchain Brad does really indepth Reviews on projects and doesn't get paid for them so definitely worth checking out his channel as well.\n\n02:15 - Explains verticals Quant are targeting - Financial services, Government, Healthcare, manufacturing, supply chain, IOT\n\n03:40 Bank client that went with hyperledger fabric 2 years ago and used Overledger to migrate to another blockchain\n\n4:35 Working with 570 banks\n\n5:15 - \"What ripple have been trying to do talk to each bank and sign them on 1 by 1, **IBM with stellar i've heard that hasn't gone to well lately so we are looking into it.** They are trying to sign on banks 1 by 1 and that's going to take a long time to do it\n\n6:15 every bank has a payment gateway - does SWIFT, domestic payments, credit cards, international payments whatever the gateway does and SIA runs that infrastructure, secure and regulated by the Bank of Italy, complies to the highest level of security and I ran a similar environment in the UK on behalf of the Bank of England.\n\nSo all of these banks have all of these gateways, and on these gateways Sia has SIAChain which is there implementation of 3 blockchains, Corda, Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum and so these blockchains already exist within that network and there are applications running on them today and what we are doing is these applications are limited because they are running on one blockchain and **we're bringing interopreability to it to create cross platform banking applications, core banking applications, this is rearchitecting the banking system that use Overledger and all the different blockchains, but more importantly to allow all these banking systems to connect and interoperate, so this is a big deal, your taking closed secure banking networks and allowing them to interoperate to create new multi chain applications to work across cross border networks**\n\n10:26 **the clients we are working with banking is just the start, we're working with government, working in research in a huge conglomerate, these are going to use Overledger internally for their group which is all around the world**\n\n10:54 we're allowing business interoperability, allowing trade corridors between countries and companies across borders which are not there today, and when you think about whats happening with digital assets and people are making their own tokens - J**P Morgan's coin is a great exmaple, i don't see why every other bank is not going to have their own token, so there could be a HSBC one, Santander etc, everyone is going to have their own banking internal token which is used for internal accounting purposes, moving assets. We are allowing banks to communicate openly with each other**\n\n14:50 **Our vision is to be the foundation of the next financial system (DeFi) and we are reacrchitecting this and we are not just working with retail and commercial banks but also regulators and central banks, this is the level that we are working with.**\n\n16:38 **570 banks they are going to use the technology at scale and we're not just having an application that does one thing, we're doing payments, clearing, settlement across different networks for all these banks**\n\n18:07 **what we are doing with our architecture is automating and digitizing that across different blockchains and settling between different types of currencies, tokens, assets, value in real time and that's going to fundamentally change the financial system, this is a global financial change to the financial system we are not just doing bank to bank, we are re-architecting how finance works in the future**\n\n19:20 **We ran the payment infrastructure for the bank of england and that's treated as the government as critical national infrastructure, thats the highest level of criticality because its so fundamental to the security of the country**. By having the experience and know what it takes to run a secure financial infrastrcuture and meeting the requirements of the regulators. First you meet the regulators, explain how it works\n\n24:52 **And now we're expanding to the US where we have clients lining up that want to work with us over there**. We're going to build US Market specific products from the US, for the US market using Overledger, **we're looking at things beyond just banking and payments, we're looking at traditional exchanges, digital assets, asset management, and the same for Australia and other regions.**\n\n27:27 we are really looking at ASIA, especially around singapore, hong kong and we are working with partners to go there, **just yesterday we had a meeting with a $8 billion company based in the ASIA region and they want to use Overledger for their clients and they are going to help us expand to that region, once we partner with the right bigger players**\n\n34:45 **We have been talking to Binance about adding Binance chain and connected Binance chain into Overledger means all the enterprises running permissioned blockchains can access Binance chain through Overledger for the first time, as you can't today there's no way to do it**. As well as everyone on Binance chain being able to talk to enterprises resulting in more customers for both parties, but also allows Binance chain to use Ripple, Ethereum, EOS etc through Overledger.\n\n49:08 **Oracle is one of our partners, they love what we are doing, they have looked at the technology and said interoperability is something all our customers are wanting and we are working together, we are part of the Oracle Startup ecosystem and there's more coming from that space, enterprises love the technology and its not just Oracle, but others that i can mention once allowed that want to take our technology at scale to their customers because it solves the biggest painpoints for enterprises and from a competition perspective rather than building they are partnering.**\n\n50:04 **These are multinational global organisations with 100,000 + employees, this is the scale that we are working towards to take Overledger to the mass market. We can't do it one by one in each country and sign them up but we can partner with someone that has 100 customers and they can take it to all their customers as well which helps with the adoption of our technology**\n\n53:25. Regarding exchanges we are under NDA with a few but we are focusing on Exhcanges which are good enough for the volume and the clients and the scale that we bring. **Just being transparent we are looking at traditional exchanges that also have the ability to look at Digital Assets and Quant Token is a digital asset, the market has changed since last year the big players have onboarded the ability to talk and transact digital assets on traditional exchanges that do stocks and bonds and derivatives and all traditional finance products. The market especially in Europe there's some regulatory stuff in the US that some are waiting to clear and thats fine but we're going to cater for all markets because what we bring is that Enterprise depth and volume because people need the QNT token and its explained in the Utility paper.**\n\n54:58 You need the QNT token to access the ecosystem, you need it for transactions and volume and from a security perspective nothing will run unless you have the tokens and all transactions have to be signed and validated and encrypted using the keys and the QNT token for security purposes, so without it nothing will work\n\n55:40 **Regarding when are we going to see the traditional exchanges - is it going to be sometime this year - yes absolutely, definitely sometime this year.**\n\n1:06:25 **we have a couple of development houses that are using Overledger in telecoms for their customers and looking at royalties and building that on Overledger which is all multi chain. We've got some others in banking that are separate to the SIA banks and supply chain and yes there's lot of clients.**\n\n1:08:30 People need to understand that patents are key to keeping the IP and the value of the technology you're building and like every other technology company like Apple, Microsoft or whatever they all have hundreds of patents to protect\n\nLast week we had one which was published and that's taken around 2 years to get to that level and then we just add more patents to support that one and then we have to go different jurisdictions. It's very important to us because you're keeping the value of the technology and you're protecting the value of the technology and if someone tries to copy it we've got the patents that protect it and helps the company\n\n1:11:30 **No we're not planning to exit, we're here for the long run, we see the potential, our customers see the potential we have a lot of investors talking to us who see the potential of what we are doing. we have the managing director of Rockefeller Capital Management on our board and there's other people at that level are going to join as well and so we're taking this as a long term thing and globally. We have had queries about that from a few in the last year and we have said no, not interested**\n\nYou can also find out more info about Quant at the following:\n\n[https://medium.com/@CryptoSeq/quant-network-partner-with-sia-a-game-changer-for-mass-blockchain-adoption-by-financial-9059ab411069](https://medium.com/@CryptoSeq/quant-network-partner-with-sia-a-game-changer-for-mass-blockchain-adoption-by-financial-9059ab411069)\n\n[https://medium.com/@CryptoSeq/quant-networks-overledger-part-eight-enabling-enterprise-mass-adoption-f0e0e41363ab](https://medium.com/@CryptoSeq/quant-networks-overledger-part-eight-enabling-enterprise-mass-adoption-f0e0e41363ab)",

            "text": "BEP-2 | ERC-20 |TRC-20 | OMNI\n\nA year ago when\u00a0Binance\u00a0launched Binance chain they also announced a feature that allows interoperable deposits and withdrawals. Meaning you can deposit an ERC-20 Token to your Binance account and withdraw as BEP-2 Token and vice versa.\n\nFor example you can deposit Chain Link or Matic which is an ERC20 token (from Ethereum Chain) to your Binance account and withdraw them as BEP2 token (to Binance Chain).\n\nHowever the address for both the network is different.\n\nBEP2\u00a0\u2013 Token on Binance chain starts with\u00a0bnb136ns6lfw4zs5hg4n85vdthaad7hq5m4gtkgf23\n\nERC20\u00a0\u2013 Token on Ethereum chain starts with\u00a00x0e806cea8e5beba6df97354ef7f22b66c5a2ce82\n\nLikewise the address for OMNI and TRC20 is also different.\n\nOMNI\u00a0\u2013 Token on Omni layer network starts with\u00a01JKhrVV9EsgSS5crXLBo9BRVXyuHjf2Tcp\n\nTRC20\u00a0is a token standard on TRON network and their address starts with\u00a0TWsVAb9EWAgKdumTD7XoEdkvs7AoyvkgN7\n\nAlso BEP-2 address requires the use of MEMO which is not needed for OMNI, TRC20 or ERC-20 deposits and withdrawals. So there shouldn\u2019t much confusion when depositing or withdrawing your tokens.\n\nEven when you input the wrong address the exchange will warn you with the following message.\n\n\u201cThe address does not match the currently selected network, it is recommended that you switch to another network.\u201d\n\nLikewise when you are sending\u00a0coins / tokens\u00a0from your wallet you\u2019ll get \u201cRecipient address is invalid\u201d error message if you input an incorrect address.\n\nBut now things got little confusing for many newbies after Binance launched BSC (Binance Smart Chain) and opened deposit and withdrawal option for BEP20 tokens.\n\nBEP 20 Token\n\nBEP 20 option is now available for major assets like BTC, ETH, USDT, LINK, DOT, DAI, EOS, LTC, XRP, XTZ, BCH, BAND, ADA, ONT etc.\n\nSo now when you are depositing or withdrawing any of these coins you\u2019ll be asked to choose the network type.\n\nOnce you input your wallet address or the recipients address for withdrawal the exchange will automatically select the network based on the address entered.\n\nBut what\u2019s more confusing is that both BEP 20 and ERC 20 share the same address format. Also they\u2019ve listed ETH as ERC20. Hope Binance changes this soon to avoid confusion.\n\n(ETH is neither ERC20, BEP2 or BEP20. ETH is a native coin on its own chain. ERC 20 is a token on ETH chain and BEP 2, BEP 20 is a token on Binance chain and Binance smart chain respectively)\n\nSo what is the difference between these two networks, why BEP 20 uses same address as ERC 20 and which one should I choose when transferring ETH or other coins?\n\nHere we\u2019ll not get into the technical specifications of the token standard. Instead we\u2019ll just explain the basics of these network types and give a quick introduction to pegged tokens.\n\nBEP20 Network \u2013 Binance smart chain\n\nBinance smart chain is a parallel Binance chain designed to enable smart contracts and it comes with an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible environment.\n\nIt is never meant to compete with Ethereum or replace ETH. BSC is just an ETH-compatible chain and is designed to give users more options such as fast block times, cheap transaction costs etc.\n\nUsers will now be able to transfer the same asset (ERC20 token) in shorter time and at surprisingly low cost (low gas price) on Binance smart chain (BEP20 token). These are called pegged tokens.\n\nPegged tokens?\n\nPegged tokens are a type of token that will have its value tied to the original crypto.\n\nFor example Chain Link (ERC-20) token will be pegged at 1:1 ratio with Chain Link (BEP-20) token. Not only ERC 20 tokens, but even tokenized versions of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Tether (USDT)\u00a0 are available on Binance smart chain.\n\nThe purpose of these tokens is to allow trading assets on DEXs and benefit from the speed and transactional efficiency of the new blockchain.\n\nThese coins and tokens are wrapped and pegged by Binance on 1:1 ratio to the corresponding native cryptocurrency.\n\nOn Binance scan\u00a0explorer\u00a0you can find the full list of Binance pegged tokens (BEP 20) and their contract address.\n\nBsc Scan:\u00a0https://bscscan.com/tokens/label/binance-pegged\n\n\nThese tokens are currently traded on Binance and \u00a0Binance DEX. You can transfer to and from Binance.com and can swap it for their native assets anytime.\n\nAlso\u00a0Trust wallet\u00a0is the only wallet that currently supports BEP20 token standards. Other than that you can enable Binance smart chain on your\u00a0Metamask wallet\u00a0which we\u2019ll explain in another guide.\n\nWhat is the difference between BEP-2, BEP-20 and ERC-20?\n\nMost of the popular tokens today are ERC 20 tokens that are build on Ethereum. If you are quite confused then visit\u00a0CoinMarketCap\u00a0and you should be able to figure out whether a token is built on Ethereum blockchain or Binance chain.\n\n\nERC-20\u00a0is a technical standard for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for tokens.\n\nBEP-2\u00a0is a technical standard for implementing and launching tokens on the Binance blockchain.\n\nBEP 20\u00a0represents a token standard on Binance smart chain.\n\nThis is all you need to understand:\n\nERC20\u00a0\u2013 Ethereum chain\n\nBEP 2\u00a0\u2013 Binance chain.\n\nBEP 20\u00a0\u2013 Binance smart chain\n\nFor example if you choose BEP 20 as network and withdraw your ERC 20 token then the\u00a0tx\u00a0will be visible on Bsc scan and not Etherscan. It\u2019s because you withdrew it to Binance chain and not Ethereum chain.\n\nSo when depositing or withdrawing make sure to choose the right intended network. Ensure that you use the correct chain that the platform supports.\n\nIf you require assistance or quite confused then we recommend you to contact Binance support.\n\nHope it helps.\nsource: \nhttps://coinguides.org/bep2-bep20-erc20-the-difference/",

Current electricity cost is $0.058 kWh.   electricity usage is 0.06 kW/TH\n\nSuppose we stake 1 BTCST for 1 day. \n\nElectricity usage per second = 0.06 \\*0.1 kW\n\nElectricity usage per day = 0.06 \\* 0.1\\*24 kWh\n\nTotal electricity cost for 1 day = 0.06 \\* 0.1\\*24 \\*0.058 \\*1.03 USD= 0.00860256  USD\n\n( 1.03 is multiplied because 3 percent energy will be wasted)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow using this website ([http://www.alcula.com/calculators/finance/bitcoin-mining/](http://www.alcula.com/calculators/finance/bitcoin-mining/)) I calculated how much bitcoin can be mined in 24 hrs using 0.1 TH/s . The number came out to be \n\n **Average daily revenue:** **0.00000340\u00a0BTC ($0.03)** \n\nThis second website ([https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/calculator/](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/calculator/)) told me that it is $0.014 per day. So I am going to take an average of both = $ 0.022 per day \n\nSo each token will be getting a reward of \\~ $ 0.012 per day. \n\nThat would be \\~4.4 USD per year.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let's say an average crypto savings account gives 5 percent APY, therefore each BTCST token should cost around $100. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's my analysis. It could have some flaws too. Let me know if you have any suggestions or corrections. Thanks",

I just have to wait, and watch my wallets page as my hard earned funds diminish. \n\nI have a maxed-out 2015 MacBook Pro. So I know the issue is not my computer. I'm also experienced being a lead web developer for a leading news company in the US, and I know that there is no fucking reason for a page to be stalling like that on the front end. \n\nBinance needs to get some better programmers ASAP.

My name is Blake, I am in the U.S. and I've had a Binance account since 2017. I recently regained access to my account since the second boom in bitcoin. Long story short, I tried to transfer my crypto to [Binance.us](https://Binance.us) because I discovered they no longer support U.S. citizens and I am now locked out of my account for suspicious activity and I cannot withdraw without a valid verification, which I cannot complete because I am in America. I have several hundred dollars worth of crypto that I cannot access. It's been two weeks since I submitted several tickets and I still haven't received a reply from Binance. Any suggestions? Is there a phone number I can call? I understand their terms of service changed during my hiatus but it's kind of ridiculous to leave me locked out and stranded like this from my own money, with no help. If anyone reading this has or had a similar problem please share how you got it resolved because I am absolutely defeated at this point. Thank you. Take care.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f6w89h6xvkf61.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=314519411b9b892f8afb4673edbbcff6c06830a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jljp0k6xvkf61.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a2692258711d9add5c4b7a801d5ba085b3e549d",

If etorro was the same size as Binance they would have exactly the same problem. I live in Germany and almost all crypto exchanges that are available here are highly regulated because the state wants to know every bit of information about you and your transactions, etorro doesn\u2019t even allow you to send your coins to another wallet so you don\u2019t even own anything on their website.\nIt was the same with Bitcoin a few months ago when newspapers and politicians started to blame Bitcoin to be responsible for climate change while countries like the US are literally doing nothing to protect the environment in a reasonable way.\nWhy look at the heavy industry or banks or other corrupt companies when you can just blame by Nance and Bitcoin for everything.",

Binance most certainly does not let you choose what fee you pay for the transaction, they automatically pick one for you. Usually this fee is high enough to get you into the next block to be mined. Sometimes though, especially during peak hours, fees climb and you need to pay more to get into the block. Miners will always choose transactions with the highest fees. That being said, if the transaction is super important, like others have said, trade it into another crypto like xrp and send it that way. If it's not just give it time. Check the transaction on a block chain viewer. Some allow you to see where you are in line. Don't be messing with cryptos you don't fully understand.",

The order clearly states the words \"You Pay: XXXX USD\" with all fee included. Koinal\\_io claims they charge in USD and all the exchange fee if any are charged by the bank (Spoiler: It is not true). Image of their helpdesk: [https://imgur.com/a/EQRHUPv](https://imgur.com/a/EQRHUPv) .\n\nI selected a HKD Visa credit card issued by a big name multinational US bank. The card has no fee on currency exchange or quasi-cash transaction. I used the same card with another crypto currency purchase and have no issue at all.\n\nAt the moment I finished my purchase, I found that they charged me in HKD instead of USD. The amount is 2% higher than the Visa rate (i.e. there are a fiat currency exchange fee included). **This forced me to pay the HKD to USD exchange fee charge by them.**\n\nBefore the Bitcoin transaction went into the mempool, I immediately asked the support to cancel the transaction. But they ignored and refused. After receiving the Bitcoin, I submitted another ticket (ticket number 5505) requesting them to refund the 2%. I made multiple requests but they refused all. **They lied about the transaction was charged in USD and the 2% was charged by my bank.** They tried everything to get away from the responsibilities of their scam or their mistake.\n\nMy credit card is issued by a creditable bank. They confirmed me multiple times that Koinal\\_io charged me in HKD (2% higher) and the bank charged nothing. **Koinal\\_io violates Visa rules** on dynamic currency conversion and the bank recommended me to file a transaction dispute.\n\nI filed the dispute and successfully get the 2% refunded. A big thank to my bank.\n\n**Avoid Koinal\\_io at all cost so that you are free from the difficulties I faced and Koinal\\_io's lies.**",

Most companies have issued their own crypto tokens. The stock-markets NYSE, AEX, FTSE have all been shutdown after a hack which caused global markets to collapse. Those in the know speculate that the hack is just a scape-goat propagated by central banks and governments to hide the failure of fiat-currencies.\n\nBitcoin is still king followed by Ethereum, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Saudi Aramco, Shell and Tesla.\n\nThe crypto-markets gave grown substantially now hovering around 200 trillion tether. I could say dollars but after the historic collapse they don't have any value and are not longer noted on Coinmarketcap as an unit of account.\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at 130.000 and according to \"experts\" it's currently in a bear-market after tapping 250.000. Gold is hovering around 35.000 and silver around 2500. Oil is still relatively cheap at 130 and the average income is around 40.000. Wages have not kept with the crash of fiat-currencies which means that 90 percent of the citizenry are dependent on the state to receive an additional 40.000 in UBI.\n\nThe UBI is clearly not enough to support people in their lives. The state made it illegal for landlords to charge any rent after a protest-group called Renters lives Matter went on a killing spree. To compensate the landlords all houses were equipped with hightech monitoring gadgets to collect as much data as possible to sell to big tech companies. If you don't like to be monitored you will have to pay \"home-services\" or buy a home.\n\nAll excess oil reserves are now being used to mine Bitcoin. Paying with bitcoin is more for the big shots nowadays. Common folks like to use fast, cheap and highly deflationary coins to transact in like Tesla, Apple or Amazon. Most companies started burning their own coins with a certain percentage of profit every quarter to incentivise hodling and tend to pay their employees in their crypto.\n\nOff-course the big tech coins are not really just coins. They are securities like stocks used to be and are quite centralised. God only knows what would happen to the crypto securities if Bezos, Zuckerberg or Gates would suddenly die. But in general the crypto-markets have grown up and are now more stable than let's say the wild wild west days in 2017 where every billionaire could just steer the markets with some pocketchange in every desired direction.\n\nBinance along with other crypto-exchange companies became one of the biggest beneficiaries after the closure of the global stock-markets, with a market-cap of 900 billion tether accompanying the big boys in the top 30.\n\nWhat follows...I leave up to you.",

            "text": "Hello everyone, hope you\u2019re all having fun fading the recent BTC move on Binance. I recently stumbled upon the exchange\u2019s announcement about connecting DeFi and CeFi. Eventually, I found some articles posted a couple of weeks ago regarding the update for the smart chain accelerator fund. I think it\u2019s pretty dope that a trading platform is interested in helping developers and projects, you really don\u2019t see that much nowadays. \n\nI mean it\u2019s crazy, their accelerator fund is worth $100 million in total and they have already rewarded like 6 projects with $350k. I\u2019m personally a firm believer of all things DeFi and really enjoy reading about the new projects that pop up. I have to say however that I don\u2019t know everything about EVERY project out there. I\u2019m especially not that knowledgeable about all of the projects that recently received [grants](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/421499824684901101/Discover-the-First-6-Projects-from-Binances-$100M-Accelerator-Fund?ref=JLI1VBLA&utm_source=BinanceTwitter&utm_medium=GlobalSocial&utm_campaign=GlobalSocial) from Binance. This is why I decided to visit this subreddit!\n\nBinance granted funds to **Anyswap, Arkane Network, BakerySwap, Bitquery, PancakeSwap**, and **Proxima**. What is your favorite project on this list and have you personally used any during this DeFi craze? I haven\u2019t had the chance to try out most of the projects listed here but I have read about them and found them really interesting! For me, the platform I\u2019m most excited about is Anyswap and I\u2019m really happy that their developers now have additional funds to utilize. Let me tell you why.\n\n[Anyswap](https://anyswap.exchange/) is a new DEX that launched this summer and it has been growing steadily ever since. There are new updates almost every week. I believe that they have one specific use case that may be interesting for you guys. Since Anyswap is based on the Fusion Network, a cross-chain interoperability solution, you can freely transfer tokens from one network to another with the \u2018Bridge\u2019 function. I believe that Anyswap is the only blockchain project out there that supports this kind of thing.\n\nAnyswap already [utilized this technology](https://twitter.com/AnyswapNetwork/status/1322129393884536833?s=20) by integrating the [Binance Smart Chain](https://bsc.anyswap.exchange/bridge). If you are holding assets that are native on BSC, you can exchange and transfer them across multiple networks via Anyswap. Simply head over to the Bridge tab on the main website and select any of the currently listed assets to deposit or withdraw them. It [supports](https://anyswap.medium.com/5-new-listings-on-anyswap-link-dai-yfi-comp-and-omg-1d03c4fb6bb8) ANY, LINK, DAI, UNI, COMP, OMG, and YFI. The developers also plan to add Bitcoin, Fusion, Ethereum, XRP, and Litecoin in the future.\n\nYou can create cross-chain transactions for all of these tokens and it isn\u2019t expensive at all. There is practically only a 0.1% gateway fee for using the bridge to lock out wrapped assets. It\u2019s time-efficient as well since cross-chain transactions take less than 30 minutes to complete. \n\nI\u2019m looking forward to hearing your responses. I may not be the biggest expert in this industry but I\u2019m always happy to discuss various projects and see what other people think. Sharing opinions is probably the easiest and most important way to learn about new things IMO.",

            "text": "Staking is the technique that allows investors and savers to obtain passive returns by depositing their cryptocurrencies. To do staking, all you have to do is deposit a cryptocurrency in an exchange that allows you to stake and wait to obtain rewards for said funds. The idea is similar to depositing your money in a savings account. The process of staking through an exchange is quite simple.\n\n## Staking with cryptocurrencies\n\nTo define what staking is, the first thing to do is to be clear about the differences that exist between the two main Blockchain consensus mechanisms: Proof of Work and Proof of Stake.\n\nProof of Work (PoW): it is the mechanism used in the Bitcoin blockchain. In this system, miners compete with each other to confirm transactions and produce new blocks on the chain for rewards. The miners solve math puzzles to verify that the transactions are correct and the first miner to solve the math problem gets the reward. Once the transactions have been verified, a new block is added to the blockchain. The main problem with Proof of Work is that it requires a lot of computing power and therefore electricity, which is not good for the environment.\n\nProof of Stake (PoS): it is a system based on the economic participation of users who have cryptocurrencies. The validator nodes are randomly selected from the users who have that cryptocurrency. Users with more reservations are more likely to be chosen to validate transactions. However, in order to maintain overall participation in the network, users with less money can also be chosen, although with a lower probability. It is a more ecological and sustainable mechanism than the Proof of Work.\n\n#### Staking\n\nThe action of participating in the Proof of Stake process is known as staking. Staking participants leave their cryptocurrencies locked in deposit in order to have the option of being selected by the protocol to validate a block. Users who deposit larger amounts have a better chance of being selected. That is, to do staking, all you have to do is deposit a cryptocurrency in a wallet that allows you to stake and wait to obtain rewards for the funds deposited. It is important to note that only cryptocurrencies that follow a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism can be staked.\n\nThe idea is very similar to depositing your fiat money in a traditional bank and earning interest on those funds. The rewards that are received in staking depend on the cryptocurrencies deposited, how long you deposit them, how many cryptocurrencies there are in total in the network and factors such as inflation. In fact, some blockchains follow the logic of traditional economics and offer rewards with fixed percentages to compensate for inflation.\n\nIt is common for several cryptocurrency holders to pool their resources in a group to increase their chances of validating blocks and receiving rewards. Once the rewards are received, they are distributed among the group proportionally according to the contribution of each user. This is what is known as a staking pool.\n\n#### Binance\n\nThere are two ways to do staking, from the cryptocurrency's own blockchain network or from an exchange. Doing it from the cryptocurrency's own blockchain network is somewhat more complex, although it brings more interest. On the other hand, staking from an exchange reports less interest, but the process is much easier. In this article, I will explain how to do staking from the well-known exchange Binance. I have opted for this exchange for its simplicity, but it can also be staked in the vast majority of exchanges (Coinbase, Trust Wallet, etc).\n\nIf you don't have a Binance account, the first thing to do is create one. The process is simple and very similar to that of any other exchange. Once the account is created, you can buy cryptocurrencies on Binance's own website, or transfer them if you already have a portfolio with cryptocurrencies.\n\n#### Trying to staking\n\nOnce inside the website, you have to go to the finance section and select \u201cBinance Earn\u201d.In this next step, you must decide the cryptocurrency you want to use for staking. There are more than 20 different cryptocurrencies available for staking on the Binance exchange, each with different interests. You have to take into account the possible fluctuations in the prices that the chosen cryptocurrency may suffer during the days that you are going to deposit it. It is advisable to choose cryptocurrencies with more or less stable prices.\n\nThe second issue to consider is the time one wants to deposit the funds. Binance offers different options for staking each cryptocurrency. I have chosen Cardano (ADA) and you can see how the annual interest rate varies depending on the duration of the deposit. For a duration of 60 days, the annual interest is 7.79%. For 30 days, the annual interest is 5.09% and for a flexible duration, where one chooses the number of days, the interest is only 0.48%. It is important to emphasize that the percentage of profit received for depositing the funds is annual. That is if, in the example shown you choose to deposit ADA for 30 days, the return percentage when the 30 days end will be 0.42% (5.09% / 12) on the amount deposited.\n\n#### Operation summary\n\nOnce the cryptocurrency has been chosen and the time we want to deposit our funds, we must click on \"Stake\". For staking in this example I have chosen Cardano with a duration of 60 days. When you click on stake, a window opens in which you have to enter the amount you want to deposit. I have chosen to deposit 100 ADA. On the right-hand side, it shows us a summary of the operation. In my case, the staking date is 07/02/2021, which will reimburse me for possible benefits obtained 60 days later: 09/02/2021. The benefit obtained throughout these 60 days will be 1.28 ADA. This amount has been calculated as follows:\n\n* 7.79% / 365 = 0.02% (daily interest)\n* 0.02% \\* 60 = 1.28% (60-day interest)\n* 1.28% \\* 100 ADA = 1.28 ADA\n\nOnce we confirm the purchase, a summary of the operation will be displayed in our account. The example shows the accumulated days of the deposit, the accumulated interest, and the estimated amount of the next distribution. The staking process through an exchange is quite simple. Most exchanges offer very intuitive platforms and have greatly simplified the process. Despite the fact that the interests in many cases are not very high, staking is a good option for cryptocurrencies to continuously generate small amounts of money.",

While trading, forget about real fiat value of the coin for that moment - your goal should be just to increase your assets every time you sell. Only when you want to get real money out, you want to pick the right moment, when the value is high, and then withdraw your coins to some exchange where you can turn them into real money and get it to your bank account. But be aware of all the withdraw & transfer fees - it is not efficient to transfer small amounts too often. I'd use ETH or LTC because BTC transactions can be really slow and expensive. \n\nUSDT - dangerous, it might disappear any day. No real reason to use it - as I said, forget about real USD value of the coin while trading; you just want to get more of anything. I'd avoid low market cap coins, better trade the larger ones, which also attract whales and thus have greater chance to fluctuate back and forth giving you opportunities to use lows and highs more often.\n\nIf you are not experienced day trader (I'm not either), be ready to play it safe and avoid scalping but aim for 3% - 5% profit (limit orders are useful tool for that) and wait for days when the right kind of fluctuation occurs and your limit order gets fulfilled. Day traders will laugh at such strategy; you won't earn as much as they do and you'll miss some great chances to follow \"the waves\" caused by \"whales\". However, if you don't want to spend all day trading and learning all the in-depth details and also don't want to hold and wait forever with a hope of \"to the moon\" (I doubt that it might happen again soon, considering how saturated the market already is), then cautious trading seems to be a good option.",

Can't do business with a company that doesn't allow me to withdraw my coins for longer than 1 day.\nNow it's weeks! Just don't trust them and don't use them. They never published an official announcement why they are doing this. It's very suspicious that Verge can't be withdrawn right now as well after the recent bullrun. Binance is just not trustworthy or has major technical difficulties. Either way it's not a good choice for this market where decisionmaking within minutes matters.",

And can ONLY be open when the timer is up. PLEASE for the love of God if one exist let me know I want to lock away 200k cro coins for the next 3 or 5 years. And im not talking about a coding im not tech savvy and dont feel comfortable doing it that route.\n\nThere should be also a company that you can walk in and give your crypto sign a contract and they hold it. For how much years you want. \n\nPeople always say well just put your hardrive somewhere or give it to someone like no because I cant trust myself. I AM MY WORSE ENEMY. It needs to be locked away from me. If I give it to my friend Ill get it back if I hide it ill find it. It needs to be locked so I can maximize my profit. People sold bitcoin in 2017 if they have held until 2021 they could have maximize. You see I am also a enemy. I can not predict my future self. Dont say I dont have self control or discipline. I was in the army so I have more discipline the most you guys here. Its not displine or self control that matters. I wont be the same person 5 years later and I cant control my future self. There needs to be a way to lock it up and forget about. Its easy to forget about if you cant open or do anything about it. Damn it 2021 and nothing like this is invented is frustrating.\n\nUPDATE: I know I'm an idiot for not knowing this but I learned about STAKING and that it has to stay locked for 180 days!! This is good for me and those who are long investors. Thank you guys for all the replies. :)",

            "text": "Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) are gradually becoming a popular method of purchasing and selling digital assets that have value, ranging from art to music to tweets and even memes. Many creators have been able to monetize their creativity and talent, while collectors have been able to discover a more safe way to purchase and preserve their goods. \n\nAccording to Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics business, non-fungible tokens are one of the fastest-growing areas in the crypto industry, with the NFT market expected to reach slightly over $41 billion by the end of 2021. To trade these asset kinds, you must first grasp what they are and how they might be employed.\n\nCryptographic tokens called Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are connected to digital or tokenized copies of physical things. They also act as proof of ownership for the content because they are non-interchangeable. Fungibility refers to the interchangeability and indistinguishability of an asset's units. For example, most currencies (including cryptocurrencies) are interchangeable. \n\nA genuine 100 dollar note or other denominations can be exchanged for a 100 dollar note. This is critical for an asset that is intended to be used as a means of exchange. This does not apply to NFTs, which distinguishes them. This is due to the fact that no two NFTs are alike or divisible, giving owners exclusive rights to an asset that cannot be duplicated.\n\nBecause there is no fixed price for NFTs, their prices are determined by demand and the supply chain. The value placed on NFTs by humans \u2013 buyers and sellers \u2013 determines their price. \n\nThis is not an unusual occurrence, as it already occurs with collectibles and artwork. It's also vital to remember that NFTs can't be reproduced or transferred without the owner's authorization - even if the NFT is issued by the same company. \n\nTo control and standardize their issuance, NFTs are issued on many blockchains. The most prominent blockchain is Ethereum's ERC-721 standard, but there are others as well, including Solana, Quint, NEO, Tezos, and many others. Binance's BNB Chain features its own NFT standards, which are similar to Ethereum's but more appealing to creators looking to mint NFTs at a cost substantially lower than Ethereum.\n\nNFTs are gaining more momentum every day as money becomes less valuable. People are turning to newer ways to store wealth and the next viable alternative is blockchain, which is the future of the financial system.\n\nWith NFTs, collectors can purchase digital assets stored in a blockchain and expect their value to increase in the future as a means of growing wealth and enjoying the freedom of money; and for artists and creators, it presents an opportunity to have access to a much wider market to sell content and artworks to collectors at a good value.",

Changpeng Zhao, often known as 'CZ', the company's CEO, confirmed the news on Twitter in a series of messages.\n\nRonin Bridge, an Ethereum sidechain for Axie Infinity users, was stolen, according to a previous report from Kripteu Magazine. As a result, in a loss of about 173,600 ETH and 25.5 million USDC owing to a vulnerability. This is the most significant DeFi hack yet, and it has established a precedent for future instances. \n\nThe monies were reportedly laundered via Tornado Cash, making it impossible for blockchain specialists to monitor the data. Tornado Cash received about 21,000 ETH, with a portion of the funds put on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. According to Zhao, the monies were allocated to over 86 Binance accounts. \n\nToday, the DPRK hacking squad started transferring their stolen Axie Infinity monies. Binance received a share of the money distributed over 86 accounts. The amount recovered was $5.8 million. This is something we've done before for other initiatives, Zhao noted.\n\nThe true entity behind the Ronin Bridge breach was the North Korean hacker outfit, Lazarus, according to a recent article by Kripteu Magazine. The US Treasury Department and the FBI worked together to follow the cash as they were moved from Tornado Cash.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the FBI believes these breaches are a source of cash for Kim Jong UN's North Korean regime. Besides that, many new initiatives focusing on environmental well-being, such as SET and Plastik, were hoping to list on these platforms but they may have had trouble generating good replies. Meanwhile, Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, is working to retrieve the taken assets.\n\nThe North Korean hacker outfit Lazarus was revealed to be the true preparator of the Ronin Bridge breach in a previous article by Cryptonary. It's also worth noting that the FBI believes such breaches are a source of cash for North Korea's Kim Jong Un-led government.",

            "text": "**Update 21 March:** \n\nAlthough Binance support was responsive following this Reddit post, the third deposit recovery application was once again rejected. \n\nThanks for the advice in these comments! I'll bring it up on Twitter as advised before taking other offline measures. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Original Post:**\n\nI've heard horror stories of people losing funds when depositing to the wrong network on Binance. However, in this specific instance I did everything right when depositing BNB to Binance on the Ethereum network. The problem is that once received to the Binance wallet, the BNB was for some reason converted to WBNB which is not supported on the Ethereum network.\n\nObviously, I should have sent a smaller amount first to test. No need to remind me of that. Really\u2014if you're thinking of commenting that I should have sent a smaller amount first as a test, I'd like to ask you a favor and please refrain. I already know.\n\nBut aside from that, this was not my mistake. I properly sent BNB from MetaMask to Binance on the Ethereum network to the correct address.\n\nI'm now on my third deposit recovery application right now after my first two were rejected. I really hope the current application is successful, but I'm considering the options for if it is not including some legal action.\n\nHere's how it happened.\n\nOn 18 February, I swapped 3 ETH for BNB within MetaMask (which was about $10,000 USD at the time, which is why I use that figure in the post title). Here's that BNB swap in MetaMask:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwh1mm4wxwm81.png?width=306&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b4041fc5f21aa0c65ac462779cd193c9c405dc\n\nI then found out that I could not use the BNB on sites like PancakeSwap, since the BNB now in my MetaMask wallet resides on the Ethereum network.\n\nI looked at Binance and saw that there is the option to deposit on the Ethereum network. Here's what the notice says:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gs4clm12xwm81.png?width=330&format=png&auto=webp&s=cebfb9b35e2c86ef8fe7b3564d2987c55c00dcd2\n\nSo I figured I'd send the BNB to Binance where it would be converted to the mainnet, then send it back to MetaMask.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8rw6nmyhxwm81.png?width=522&format=png&auto=webp&s=e36fc7f5ff98154ead1bcf8673df80545365f9f9\n\nI copied the address and sent the BNB as instructed. I carefully checked that I had the correct coin, network and wallet address.\n\nNow again, I know I should have sent a test amount first. Hindsight is so great, right? But the reason I didn't was because I had already successfully sent plenty of ETH using the EXACT same method and wallet address. I didn't think of it as a new kind of transaction, even though I obviously should have.\n\nWithin MetaMask, the transaction appeared like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tubo2o5ywm81.png?width=315&format=png&auto=webp&s=033faa6af205fef5daf85098e910513b2acbfde8\n\nAfter a few minutes the worry started to set in. After a few hours, I knew there was a problem.\n\nI immediately submitted a deposit recovery application. After 2 days, the application was rejected stating that I had claimed the wrong coin, and the correct coin was WBNB. This was honestly the first time I ever heard about WBNB, I had no idea what that was before.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tnx3z0r7zwm81.png?width=465&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2325f97bca6178e24a14c70475189b108bc539f\n\nSo, after doing some research and learning about WBNB, I submitted a new application to recover my WBNB from the Ethereum network the same day. A few days later, I got a notice from Binance asking me to \"resubmit materials,\" which turned out to mean they wanted to know the wallet address to send the recovered funds, which I provided. After that, the application entered the status \"Processing funds,\" with a notice that it could take up to 30 days. I was fine with that. I could wait.\n\nThen today suddenly, I got notice that Binance is \"unable to handle your Uncredited Deposit Application.\" The application details have only the remarks \"collection failed.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uvzqdxgx0xm81.png?width=459&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcb7053b696b74c44eba7271b0f275cf6683aadb\n\n[Here is the wallet](https://blockchair.com/ethereum/address/0x410628909443d9968553c66d69b53822cc64fc48) which I sent what I was certain was BNB to. It shows a balance of 21 WBNB, which is the amount I sent (under the impression that it was BNB). This address is obviously dedicated to my Binance transactions, because the only other transaction there is also mine, an ETH transfer to Binance. That same wallet address is still the same one Binance asks me to send deposits to them (though I doubt I'll be doing that), meaning the wallet is open and active. Binance holds the wallet and private keys, and is perfectly capable of accessing the wallet. This means they are perfectly able to recover the funds, even if it won't be easy or fast. Binance has proven many times that when they want to do something, they do it.\n\nWhat I'm saying here is, I don't buy the argument that it's impossible to recover the funds.\n\nI even have the watch-only wallet to keep an eye on it:\n\n[The funds are right. There.](https://preview.redd.it/1k3gmvsm3xm81.png?width=321&format=png&auto=webp&s=702172f623eadec68be5c39e0843371f7344fe48)\n\nAnyway, I've got the third application open now which I hope somehow resolves. Meantime, I'm preparing other avenues of contact and getting legal advice on my options. I'd appreciate thoughts on this, and also I wonder where in the process what clearly appeared as BNB in MetaMask turned out to be WBNB?",

Besides that, here are some things worth noting.  \n  \n1. Always do a test transaction, regardless of how sure you are (or how much of a rush you are in).  \n2. Metamask (and other wallets) don't always show the exact correct token symbol; check your transaction hashes to see what the actual tokens are.  \n3. Some tokens can have the exact same symbol, when they are in fact different tokens. Again, check your transaction hashes.  \n4. You swapped ETH via UniswapV3 for Wormhole BNB i.e. BNB which is wrapped by the Wormhole protocol.  \n5. Wormhole BNB, despite the abbreviation of WBNB, is different to the Wrapped BNB (also WBNB) found on the Binance Smart Chain.  \n6. BNB doesn't exist on the Ethereum Blockchain, and as such, any version of it you have on Ethereum will be some kind of wrapped BNB.  \n  \nIt looks like you have tried to swap the wrong kind of wrapped BNB vs. what was expected by the contract you interacted with. Theoretically, it is possible for Binance to remedy this. I would be as persistent as you can be. Typically with the Binance live chat, you will be transferred to members of whichever team they deem the most fit to help you resolve your issue. If it isn't resolved by a particular team, try to get transferred to a different team the next time, perhaps by framing your problem differently, or just asking for specialists in one area to help with a complex issue.  \n  \nGood luck pal.",

In addition, Binance paused withdrawals of wrapped ether (wETH) on the Ethereum network, and the convert function from wETH to ETH.\n\nToday, the crypto exchange said deposits and withdrawals for Axie Infinity (AXS) and Smooth Love Potion (SLP) on the Ronin (RON) network have been resumed. However, withdrawals of Wrapped Ether (WETH) on the Ethereum network, and the convert function from WETH to ETH remain closed, until the exchange deems it to be stable.\nWith the way attacks are on the rise, I hope that crypto exchange, Binance, NFT Marketplace, OpenSea and even crypto e-commerce marketplace, Exeno outfit themselves with better security features.  \n\nBinance said a dedicated team continues to monitor for unusual transactions.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ronin said an attacker \"used hacked private keys in order to forge fake withdrawals\" from the Ronin bridge across two transactions, and tallied losses at 173,600 ether (ETH) and 25.5 million USDC, or more than $625 million at current values.",

My intention was to withdraw the BEP-20 USDT from FTX to my Binance account via BNB Chain but miscopied the Binance deposit address and pasted it with a previously copied [contract address](https://debank.com/profile/0xb2EC38aE446458592d2ed030cA34141Ce2943E77). Both the addresses ended in '7' so I thought it was my Binance BEP-20 deposit address when I was going through the process. I only realized it was the incorrect address after the confirmation had completed awhile ago and deposit was not credited.\n\nThe contract address is clearly an Ethereum contract address: [https://etherscan.io/address/0xb2ec38ae446458592d2ed030ca34141ce2943e77](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb2ec38ae446458592d2ed030ca34141ce2943e77) and therefore it cannot be accessed because the private key to the address is not accessible to anyone ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70394350/how-can-i-get-the-private-key-of-the-address-of-the-underlying-contract-through)). Therefore this contract address cannot be accessed on BNB Chain, as the BNB and ETH address share the same private key.\n\nI have asked Binance customer service about this and they said it was not eligible for the BNB Pioneer Burn Program because Binance cannot access the contract address. I thought that was the point of this burn program because the funds are lost forever in contract addresses. Would you deem this situation eligible for the BNB Pioneer Burn Program?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kibooxttowu81.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=591083e87519b5766e100b96369241974c131b66",

There was no data tracked by the blockchain.\nThere was around  21,000 ETH which was being rolled via Tornado Cash, a slab of the fund deposited on the Binance crypto exchange.\n\nChangpeng Zhao added that these funds were distributed back in over 86 accounts on Binance.\n\nThe other recent report by Kripteu Magazine encompassed the point that the actual matter behind this Ronin Bridge hack was the North Korean hacking group, Lazarus. \n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the US Treasury Department operated together to track the funds as they were disseminated from Tornado Cash. It is believed by the FBI that the hacks are a great source of revenue for the North Korean government. It is asserted that North Korea is the only one behind these attacks.  \n\nBinance is trying to help multiple collaborative program out there who are working to bring together the global community of designers, artists, curators, bloggers, influencers, brands, and buyers one such project is Faith Tribe which can catch a lot of attention.",

So the current limit is 0.1000 ETH per day.\n\nNow my question is, what's best way to proceed for staking? Should I just trade my ETH for BETH? or should I stake 0.1000 each day for 20 days (I don't mind doing this) to get my staking rewards?\n\nI saw on a lot of threads that just holding BETH will give me rewards but I couldn't see that documented anywhere on Binance website.

            "text": "Yesterday my life changed. I had just finished up a job interview and I was reflecting on if I did well or not and I looked at my phone. My heart froze. I was looking at Trust Wallet notifications telling me that my funds were being successfully transferred to another account in real time. I was watching this person take 80% of my life from me. The transactions happened in a span of about 5 minutes before I transferred what was left in my wallet to another wallet and cashed out in fear of being hacked again. \n\nI saw that they transferred it to a Binance address so I immediately submitted a support ticket with both Binance US and Trust Wallet detailing how much was stolen and the etherscan links, hoping they\u2019d be able to freeze this nasty little rat\u2019s assets. MY F*CKING ASSETS. \n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out how this happened and I cannot for the life of me understand. My key only exists on a piece of a paper hidden in my childhood bedroom in my parents house, where nobody can see it ever. I even called my mom and asked if any strangers or maintenance people had been in my room. Nobody. So this means it must have been some sort of external hack like the metamask hack or the t-mobile hack a few weeks ago (I have t-mobile). I did a malware scan on my computer and found 13 viruses, but I\u2019m not sure if that is even related because I only had trust wallet on my iphone. \n\nWhoever did you you\u2019re a scum bag. And I hope karma catches up with you. \n\nIs there anybody who has dealt with this? Is there anyone who has successfully gotten their coins back? Are there any legit coin recovery organizations you would recommend or next steps that might help me recover MY money? \n\nAll in all, don\u2019t use Trust Wallet. Use cold storage. That\u2019s what I should have done. If you got money in trust wallet right now that you don\u2019t want stolen from you, take it out and don\u2019t take risk in  crypto until you get a cold storage.  But whoever took my hard earned money I hope you encounter the worst luck anyone on this earth has ever seen.",

The first type is the validators, known as\u00a0**Enterprise Validator Nodes**. As of February 2022, there are 16 validator nodes operated by Theta Labs and several renowned companies such as Google, Sony, Samsung, Binance, etc.\n\nAround 3.500\u00a0**Guardian Nodes**\u00a0make up the 2nd part of the consensus group.

            "text": "This question comes up a lot and was put forward by one of our community members. I think it's important to break down what costs (not necessarily in a dollar figure as this can fluctuate from one blockchain to another) are involved if you decide to create your own NFT asset or collection.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n**Creating the Art**\n\nThis is usually the easiest part to some degree. If you're an artist who already has a backlog of designs that you could turn into an NFT, then this step will take no time at all. This also goes for creators who have content produced or designers who have a strong handle on Adobe Suite products.\n\nHowever, if you don't have a design background or don't have anyone who may want to be involved in the project that does, there are platforms where you can find designers to help for a cost.\n\n1. Behance - Designer Dependant (inbox them for prices)\n2. Dribbble - Designer Dependant (inbox them for prices)\n3. Fiver - Depending on what you want, the price can start at as little as $50 USD\n4. Upwork - Hourly rate based, approx of $15-20/per hour for a designer\n\nBefore going to these sites and sending inquiries, it's important to have the following penciled down otherwise you're wasting your time and the designers. This doesn't mean you need to know every single detail, but a general idea of the below will make this process A LOT easier for both parties.\n\n1. Style of design you like, gather some inspiration (visit Pinterest, OpenSea, Reddit, etc)\n2. Your budget (Keep in mind there are other costs for minting etc)\n3. The amount of NFT's you want to create\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n**Choosing a Marketplace**\n\nNow that you have your NFT art ready, it\u2019s time to mint it and put it up for sale. For this, you need an NFT marketplace that supports the blockchain of your choice. There are a few options when looking for the right fit, so researching Ethereum, Solana, Tezos, and Algorand are great starting points.\n\nOne of the biggest differences between Ethereum and the rest would come down to the gas fees, security, and active users.\n\nYou can find previous threads at /WhatTheNFT that provide great insight into the marketplaces on these blockchains and where may suit best for your NFT collection.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n**Pricing (How much should I charge?)**\n\nThere are some factors that contribute to this and it's not always an easy task. If you're new to the NFT space, it\u2019s better to start at a lower price. Once you have established yourself, you can increase the prices of your future collections or drops.\n\nThe golden rule most creators follow is to never mint their artwork if the gas fees are more expensive than the artwork itself. Many NFT projects also offer extra benefits for holders such as membership benefits, metaverse land, exclusive merch, and events, among others. In such scenarios too, you can price your NFT higher (this is a little more advanced, but content creators are looking to build in access to their NFT drops, so it's still relevant in some cases).\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n**Minting**\n\nMinting an NFT is how your digital art becomes a part of the blockchain\u2013a public ledger that is unchangeable and tamper-proof.\n\nEach marketplace will have its own steps to mint NFTs. Here are the basic steps you have to follow:\n\n1. Create a digital file of your NFT art and make sure the file format is supported by your marketplace of choice.\n2. Create an account on the marketplace, connect your wallet, and click the create option (this may be placed different, depending on the marketplace)\n3. Upload your file, give a name and description, and add properties and unlockable content (if available).\u00a0\n4. Lastly, click create and you are all set!\n\nThe other alternative is **Lazy Minting**. Put simply, lazy minting is when an NFT is available 'off-chain' and only gets minted once there is a sale of the NFT. This means that the artist doesn't have to pay any upfront gas fees to mint their NFT. Another way to look at lazy minting is to see it as a way to defer the payment of gas fees until the NFT is sold. This really only makes sense though if you are going to use Ethereum, as gas fees can be very pricey at times.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\nHope this gives beginners a solid idea of costs and considerations when creating an NFT or collection. Minting fees and marketplace costs vary, so you will need to do a little research on your end. But this gives you a framework you can start to work towards. #WAGMI\n\n **Edit**: Special thanks to [r/WhatTheNFT](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatTheNFT/) ",

Just some thoughts about one upcoming project and its perspective at least.  \n\u2022 The crypto user base will surpass 100 million in January 2022, fueling the rapid creation and acceptance of crypto apps.\n\n\u2022 There are almost 70 million blockchain wallet users and over 80 different types of wallets. Wallets are only one form of cryptocurrency software.\n\n\u2022 There are almost 4,000 active cryptocurrency-based decentralized apps running across more than a dozen blockchain platforms, including Ethereum, Solana, BSC, and others.\n\n(This figure does not include all of the market's centralized crypto applications, such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.  \nSo if there are so many crypto apps already on the market, where are they hosted? Sure, Not in one source. Magic Square IO, one of the upcoming events in 2022 is gonna create the first ever DAO marketplace for all the crypto apps. It has to be worthy stuff. Firstly because of the hostage and basing on the unique but not new format. All is not integrated and implemented into Blockchain. So the place where all those DeApps have to be allocated have to be invented sooner or earlier. Magic Square has all the possibilities and created a nice plan with many different features started from SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) for one-click login, payments subscription, in-app monetization, and out-of-the-box staking solutions within their crypto applications and finishing with in-app activity rewarding for users/consumers.   \nOn the other side there are still some invocations and challenges for the project. They have to prove serious intentions already at the beta test period. Then we will see the uniqueness and real intentions. Consumers have to be supplied only with useful stuff. Market is already filled  with a mess..",

Like gas in ethereum for example. Each blockchain has its own method but all of them require to pay a fee to interact with the blockchain. And as far as I know, when I trade BUSD for ETH, for example, I am interacting both with the BUSD blockchain and with the ETH blockchain, to take coins out of one wallet and put coins into the other wallet.\n\nI know that for example ONE has incredibly low fees, so yeah, it won't matter if I buy 300 coins or 3000. Fees will be more or less the same. Binance gets a 0.1% commission because I am VIP0 and trade via BUSD instead of BNB.\n\nBut I wonder what goes on with ETH. If I want to buy let's say 100 BUSD in ETH... can I predict the transaction fee? Because I've read that ETH is very expensive to do transactions. So if I will pay like 20 BUSD to buy 100 BUSD... then it's probably better to wait to have more cash and buy 2000 BUSD. I will lose money if I trade small amounts.\n\nBut the thing that confuses me is, how can I not predict at least an estimate of the fee when setting orders?\n\nDo this kind of fees not apply for trading?",

Recently, ETH has undoubtedly encountered a drive popular, which has added to its combined location development after the resource experienced enormous capital outpourings last month.\n\nAs of late, Celsius Network CEO Alex Mashinsky expressed that Ethereum 'flippening' Bitcoin is occurring now and will turn out to be more inescapable. More extensive selection of Ethereum is normal as Mashinsky accepts that layer two arrangements will fix ETH's issues sooner rather than later.\n\nETH 2.0, then again, will be a generous and slow upgrade on layer two arrangements, yet the two frameworks will work couple later on, as per Mr. Mashinsky.\n\nSeven days prior, Ethereum overwhelmed Bitcoin in complete everyday dynamic locations without precedent for crypto history, recommending that interest for the world's second-biggest digital currency is rising.\n\nThe dynamic locations on a crypto network show the complete number of senders and recipients for a given coin.\n\nSince Ethereum has quite outperformed Bitcoin as far as day-by-day dynamic locations, it may flag that the world's second-biggest digital currency by market capitalization is on its way to turning into the most well-known.\n\n[https://www.muda.tech/](https://www.muda.tech/)",

Kind confused Either end of Jan, Phase 1 or 2 years when it's ready? \"\n\nThere are 2 ways to get your ETH \"back\". You start the Staking, get BETH and wait till the Merge of ETH 1 and ETH 2 happens (1-2 Years). Or you just take your BETH and sell them for ETH on Binance. The Exchangerate will probably be 1:1. So you can get ETH for BETH as soon as BInance starts the Traidingpair (prob. January).\n\nBut you only get the \"Staking Rewards\" for the BETH you hold on Binance. So when you sell your BETH for ETH you obviously no longer get the rewards.\n\n\" When you stake are you accruing the coins or is it along as you get in  the certain time you will get x coins? If so does that mean I get stake  at the last minute before closing? \"\n\nBinance pays out daily (i guess) staking Rewards in BETH. You can ether hold that and stack up or you can sell your earned BETH for ETH as discribed earier.",

Today we would like to tell you more about it, especially in light of events leading to the **Binance Bridge** being discontinued.\n\n**Hashbon Rocket is a first ever decentralized exchange (DEX) that can facilitate multi-chain transactions without any barriers.** \n\nOur platform makes it easy for users to connect the BSC and Ethereum mainnet in order to exchange **BEP-20 for ERC-20 token**s. However, with the way [Hasbon Rocket](http://rocket.hashbon.com/) is growing, users will be able to trade tokens native to EVM compatible chains such as Solana and Polygon (MATIC) in the future. \n\n**Hashbon Rocket also makes it possible for users to earn passive income by becoming a liquidity provider.** \n\nWhat you need to do is launch the Dapp on [Hashbon Rocket](http://rocket.hashbon.com/) and connect your [metamask](http://metamask.io/) wallet. After doing that, you can then \u201ccreate a new pool\u201d in the \u201cPools\u201d section of the site and fill in all the necessary fields. \n\nThat\u2019s all you need to become a liquidity provider on Hashbon Rocket and earn a steady passive income.

The integration of these assets over time with larger platforms is still, truly, at the behest of those larger platforms. An early and promising attempt at integration has come with blockchain gaming, with assets in play-to-earn games being NFTs that users can hold in their wallets to unlock features in their games. However, they are still in their infancy, and right now are more hype than reality.The idea of NFTs being used for sports ticketing is intriguing (remember, it\u2019s just a key to whatever it needs to be a key to), and a huge boom in NFT sports collectibles have emerged around Barcelona, Porto, PSG, and other large clubs fan tokens. Messi even received part of his PSG contract in the club\u2019s own NFTs.Some players in the space:So what of that current market? Well, on the 23rd December, [the Bored Apes finally flipped the Cryptopunks](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/128338/bo%E2%80%A6), overhauling a lifelong time at the top for the 2017 collection credited with starting the NFT craze.Right now, OpenSea rules the roost on Ethereum, with other platforms like Rarible also doing a roaring trade acting as an auction house. However, NFTs have already broken away from their grandfather blockchain (and thus, it\u2019s important to note, changing the blockchain authenticating them) for the same reason many other crypto sectors did \u2014 it\u2019s just too slow and expensive. New NFT communities on Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Fantom, and now Terra have sprung up in force, with their blue chip projects, trading for tens of thousands of dollars already \u2014 and that\u2019s just the start of it. Also, [Onomy Protocol](https://onomy.io/) will, in ethos with their blockchain-agnostic approach, support full storage and collections of these NFTs through Onomy Access, their multi-chain DeFi wallet. The difference? You won\u2019t have to download a dozen browser extensions just to manage your collection. Neither will you have to constantly change the network. Your collection will \u2014 simply put \u2014 exist before your very eyes, no matter the chain.Some sources for this: techcrounch and onomy",

The need for an ecosystem like Ethereum became more apparent as more people started using crypto on a daily basis and realized bitcoin wasn\u2019t as practical. The same thing will happen with BNB as crypto continues to become a large part of mainstream finance. BNB does what ETH does just as well if not better in terms of efficiency, but the real icing on the cake is the affordable transaction fee. Regardless of the application, when using ETH daily the gas fees are absolutely absurd at peak times during the day. I tried to buy 50 dollars worth of an Ethereum based token and the final cost was over 250 dollars. Who\u2019s gonna realistically pay that on a daily basis when it comes to sending money? The gas fees will only continue to rise as more people use the blockchain, it just isn\u2019t as sustainable as BNB. The most In fees I\u2019ve ever had to pay to send BNB,or buy a BSC token was 30 dollars on a 300 dollar transaction. Only time will tell, but I truly think BNB will surpass ETH in market cap for that reason. What do you guys think?",

From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from books to our weekly Moonshot Monday podcast. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)\n\n**Market Overview**\n\nThe crypto market continues its new bull run, which re-commenced in July, hitting a new high of $2.7 trillion. Both Bitcoin and Ether also reached all time highs in October. Binance Coin, Tether and Cardano make up the top five by market cap. The Fear and Greed index currently sits at \u2018Greed\u2019, which compares to last week\u2019s \u2018Extreme Greed\u2019 and last month\u2019s neutral.\n\n**Trending**\n\n**SEC Approves Bitcoin Futures ETF**\n\nAfter years of false starts the crypto industry finally got its ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). The SEC approved the ProShare Bitcoin Strategy ETF. After two days on the NYSE ProShare\u2019s ETF became the fastest fund ever to reach $1 billion in assets under management. Physically based bitcoin ETFs, where you invest directly in bitcoin, are still waiting approval, but it is a promising start.\n\n**SEC Chairman claims U.S won\u2019t ban crypto**\n\nIt came as a relief to the market when Gensler the Chairman of the SEC declared that the U.S would not ban crypto but would seek to better regulate it. Although the final decision would be up to Congress. That regulation is most likely to be focused on the stablecoin market to begin with.\n\n**Walmart enters crypto**\n\nWalmart shoppers can now buy bitcoin at 200 kiosks in its stores. The test is with Coinstar which offers bitcoin at more than 3,000 kiosks.\n\n**Axie Infinity creator raises $152 million**\n\nAxie Infinity is one of the most popular play-ro-earn games on the blockchain commanding a $38 billion valuation (fully diluted). An Investment in the creator rather than the tokens is a telling sign that the tokens do not represent good value. Avoid for now.\n\n**Memecoin mania**\n\nShiba Inu, the memcoin named after another dog, saw its token rocket in value before falling back after a comment from Musk that he didn't own any. But that comment didn't stop its rise and it is now valued above Dogecoin at $38 billion. Of course that has reignited the search for the next Doge or Shiba, a search we won't be embarking on.\n\n**Squid Games pump and dump**\n\nA token inspired by the Netflix show Squid Games saw its price spiral upwards by 380,000% on its debut. That upwards momentum continued as the price hit $2,861. However the price came crashing down as the founders cashed out with a $12 million profit and left the \u2018project\u2019. That my friends is the danger of investing in memecoins and projects with no fundamentals.\n\n**NFT mania**\n\nCoinbase announced it was launching an NFT marketplace focusing initially on Ethereum based NFTs.\n\n**The good and bad of Robinhood**\n\nRobinhood\u2019s announcement that it was launching a crypto wallet hit the share price of Coinbase particularly after they revealed they had already signed up 1 million people to the upcoming product. However Robinhood suffered its own set back a few days later when it reported its quarterly earnings. The main cause of concern was the fall off in crypto trading from $233 million in the previous quarter to $51 million in the current. The shares tanked.\n\n**USDC finds itself under investigation**\n\nOne of the leading stable coins, number two behind Tether, was issued with a subpoena from the SEC back in July, only recently coming to light however. It was also disclosed that the investigation continues. USDC announced it was shifting its reserves to only cash and treasuries. It is expected that the SEC will oversee the stablecoin market in the short term, something which will no doubt send shivers up the spine of Tether.\n\n**Tether\u2019s house of cards**\n\nLast month we reported that the SEC is investigating Tether. This month they were hit with a $42.5 million fine by the CFTC. It was also reported in a Bloomberg expose that billions of dollars of client money has been invested in risky crypto projects, something the team at Tether initially denied but was later confirmed by Celsius who benefited from an investment of $1 billion. This is a devastating revelation and is a sure sign that if there was ever a bank run investors would suffer massive losses.\n\n**New York targets DeFi Lending**\n\nBoth Nexus and Celsius received cease and desist letters from the New York Attorney General. Nexus and Celsius are lending platforms targeting private investors.\n\n**Finally...**\n\nA new survey suggests 11.4% of adults around the world own crypto. Nigeria, Malaysia and Australia have the highest rate of adoption. Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Philippines, Mexico and the US make up the top 10.\n\n**Receive you free monthly newsletter by subscribing** [**here**](https://cryptoquestion.tech/newsletter/)\n\n**Mr. Moonshot gets his own TV show!**\n\nLast week we launched our new show, Moonshot Weekly.

            "text": "  \n\nWe provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**:\n\nPolygon demand is growing due to a shortage in Layer 1 infrastructure. The solutions offered by Polygon are perfectly suited to the current market needs.\n\nIn terms of design mechanism, Polygon focuses entirely on network activities. Voting incentives are undertaken by the core team. $MATIC holders have voted only for selecting Block Producers. In terms of token mechanism, $MATIC has major benefits from the point of view of transaction verification. Providing evidence of fraud is also rewarded.\n\nIn the future, Polygon will do well until Layer 1 has a better, cheaper way for users to improve performance. For example, when Ethereum's Sharding launches, that network will operate more efficiently and cheaply, so the demand from Polygon will decrease. However, Polygon is developing solutions that Layer 1s themselves take a lot of time to develop. This is the potential that Polygon will be able to achieve in the future. \n\n# Introduction\n\nUp to now, when the bottlenecks of the Ethereum network have not been able to be fully resolved, Layer 2 solutions have stepped in, revealing their remarkable advantages.\n\nFormerly Matic Network, Polygon has great ambitions to deploy all layer 2 solutions for themselves, to be an all-in-one solution platform for both users and developers.\n\n# What is Polygon? What is $MATIC?\n\nThe token is $MATIC and Polygon used to be MATIC about three years ago. There are three groups of developers who had this idea of creating layer 2 just for the Ethereum layer. They called it MATIC. They've been working for some time and today it is live! Now it has changed to Polygon.\n\n## Layer 1\n\nLayer 1 is the base layer which is things like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot, etc. This is the core underlying fundamental layer that allows all these different transactions to work. All the transactions that are taking place go into this big database that is layer 1.\n\n## Layer 2\n\nLayer 2 is the smaller database that exists on top of the layer 1 database for faster and cheaper transactions. As you know, the transactions on layer 1 are very expensive because it is more secure. So, if there is going to be a lot more art going around or a lot more NFTs being created, we do not want to be paying so much money all the time. This is where layer 2 comes in because we have faster and cheaper transactions in layer 2 which is the perfect use case for NFTs.\n\n# How does Polygon work?\n\nPolygon works in four composable layers:\n\n## The Ethereum Layer\n\nI call this the OG layer or the original layer. This is where the core basic or the fundamental architecture involving different transactions is recorded which is like a huge core database.\n\nThis is where finality, staking, disputes, messaging and all these different crypto-related verifications happen. This is very secure but because it's so secure you sometimes have to make a trade-off in terms of scalability.\n\n## The Security Layer\n\nThis layer exists above the Ethereum layer and runs parallel to it. It is like a synthetic world or the Sims world. You exist in real life but in your Sims computer game, you have this person that is living a similar life with you although in a different kind of house.\n\nIt's the same idea where you have all these transactions happening on the Ethereum layer and on the security layer they run parallel with each other. You can share the different kinds of validation in the Ethereum layer and the security layer.",

For example, the infamous Wordpress (Woocommerce) bug that exposed products that supposed to be hidden: [https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/27954](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/27954). The LYXe/ETH trading pair webpage is probably under construction and can only be accessed by the developers. They also generated the sitemap file. Visitors from the public internet are blocked by inbound firewall rules and are unable to access the website.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/amo3bjj8h2v71.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=379a6584b4407b4b8d26778d8846d3e6183494a3\n\n**So, what is LYXE (Lukso)?**\n\nLUKSO is a Blockchain infrastructure, providing a series of standards and solutions for physical and digital consumer goods, in order to foster transparency, circularity and new forms of responsible production and consumption. it's no coincidence that this pair will be listed on binance. [They just announced that their L15 testnet will launch this Tuesday.](https://mobile.twitter.com/feindura/status/1451585240091303968)\n\nLUKSO is founded by Fabian Vogelsteller. He also authored the ERC-20 token standard, which opened up the ICO wave in 2017. In addition, Fabian is also responsible for some other renowned open-source projects, like Ethereum\u2019s first decentralized web3 browser Mist, Ethereum wallet, and web3.js library, the most used developer tool in the Blockchain community, it is a solid project if you ask me.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vuw3sgbni2v71.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0cc1057e0d5055fd907e89e91a3cb9c70c22614\n\nEdit: Binance tried to fix their mistake and removed it, it is still visible with the way back machine https://web.archive.org/web/20211020144711/https://www.binance.com/sitemap_en_3.xml",

Which enables Users to create Wallets without the need of storing complicated seed words easing the onboarding for new users into blockchain. It will allow developers to create things that have endless possibilities examples are more complex NFTs. Also Lukso is designated to become the platform for creating Social Currencies and Networks with the introduction of erc725 (Universal Public Profiles) and in general to be the fo to platform for the creative economy. The platform will work harmoniously with other EVM chains and will most likely be the first EVM Chain to run ETH 2.0 with the new Casper Algorithm! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzcL\\_UvUk40",

            "text": "There has been a growth in the NFT Market this year compared to last year. But, there will be a study on why the most popular collections became what they are today. \n\nBAYC (Bored Ape Yacht Club)\nBAYC has increased in value since it's launch forming an average price of 41.3 ETH which is equivalent to $180,000 as of October 10, 2021 on Open Sea. What could be their secret which makes them stand out from the rest of NFT collections churned out on daily basis?\n\n1. Their Concept.\nBAYC is a collection of 10,000 apes on the Ethereum network and each ape is distinct having different attributes based on a combination of different properties. The uniquely designed characteristics of each ape draws attention of investors cause the apes do look full of personality.\n2. The Holder Benefits\nOne of the benefits exclusive to holders of BAYC is the virtual graffiti space \" BAYC Bathroom\". The BAYC Bathroom gave holders a sense of being part of an exclusive community in the form of gamified participatory art.\n3. Partnerships\nThrough partnerships with other NFT projects,  BAYC is expanding its NFT usage. They have asserted their values and vision by expanding its scope to the Metaverse  through activities such as building it's own space for BAYC Investors in Decentraland or the Sandbox\n\nCryptoPunks\nCryptoPunks is a collection of 10,000 NFTs consisting of four types: human ( men And women), zombies, apes and aliens. These were created randomly by adding various attributes.\nCrypto fanatics are crazy over CryptoPunks due to,:\n1. It's the oldest NFT project. It is an old NFT project and this creates a strong demand for CryptoPunks, according to Decrypt.\n\n2. Exponential growth of NFT Market.  If NFT becomes the new standard of digital ownership, CryptoPunks value is expected to grow even higher.\n\n3. High Profile Owners. These high profile owners have a way of making the project more popular. For example,  in June 21, Jay-Z  set his Twitter profile as a CryptoPunks NFT he owns, that had a way of increasing the popularity of CryptoPunks.\n\nUsing BAYC and CryptoPunks as our case studies, characteristics of the most prominent NFT collections have been looked into. In summary, it can be said that these 5 features listed above namely: Concept, Holder Benefits, Partnerships,  Position in the NFT market and High Profile Owners have played a crucial role in making BAYC and CryptoPunks as expensive NFT.\n\nFor more information\nTwitter: @witchwitch_sns\nMedium: Witch_Official\nOfficial Website: www.witchwitch.io",

            "text": "  \n\n# General Conclusion\n\nIn early 2021, we had discussions on the idea of building a decentralised Internet, commonly referred to as Web 3.0.\n\n* In the United States President Trump has been\u00a0banned\u00a0from using Twitter, and\u00a0Parler, which uses AWS services, has been removed from PlayStore and AppStore.\n* WhatsApp has\u00a0announced that they will share information with their parent company Facebook\n* Uganda\u00a0has ordered internet service providers to block all social networking platforms\n\nThese are important and understandable issues and need to be actively discussed.Small businesses and startups rely on Facebook advertising services, Google search suggestions, and Amazon's AWS service to survive. Artists and creators face the risk of having their information deleted from sites like Spotify, Instagram and Tiktok. Although these are not new problems, it is becoming more and more serious. The development of technology monopolies and their scalability to information privacy rights and personal freedoms has spurred the Internet transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0.\n\n# What Is Web 3.0?\n\nWeb 3.0 (commonly called Web3) is a reform model aimed at democratising the Internet. Web 3.0 is present in the Crypto Space and other digital fields such as AI, Virtual and Augmented Reality, and more. By applying new technologies, Web 3.0 is changing how we, as a collective, view and value the Internet. Web 3.0 is about creating an Internet that works for everyone, owned by everyone.\n\n# Where Web 3.0 Comes From\n\nThe term was originally coined in 2014 and popularised in 2018 by Ethereum co-founder and Polkadot founder Gavin Wood. The spirit of this term goes back to when Satoshi developed Bitcoin and advocated decentralised DNS called\u00a0BitDNS.\n\n>\u201cI think it would be possible for BitDNS to be a completely separate network and separate blockchain, yet share CPU power with Bitcoin.\u201d - Satoshi (2010)\n\nDNS has long been controlled by organisations such as Verisign and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) overseen by the US Department of Commerce. This centralised control of DNS has been used to enforce IP rights, prohibit websites from selling copyrighted material, censor free-of-speech sites like\u00a0WikiLeaks\u00a0and seize domain names (IP addresses) without proper procedures, etc. Censorship decisions are usually influenced by the top levels of government and the lobbyists of the largest multinational organisations, who may not always be acting in the best interests of the general public.Satoshi and other Bitcoin enthusiasts recognised this. In 2011, a fork of Bitcoin called Namecoin was born to allow censorship-proof domains at\u00a0*.bit*\u00a0domain addresses.Namecoin was ahead of its time. A proxy service or extension (such as MetaMask today) was required to log in at the\u00a0*.bit*\u00a0domain, making it very difficult to use. Plus, most people did not want their own website or personal domain at that time. All of this caused Namecoin to fail because of low demand from its users.Ten years later and now new blockchains and decentralised services may be ready for success. These applications are making the Internet more decentralised with Web 3.0. Another example of such infrastructure is the\u00a0Handshake network. \n\n# Conclude\n\nThe early internet needed avant-garde programmers and businesses to develop new products to make the Internet useful and to be rewarded for the value they created. No one knows in advance what the consequences of their construction will be.Cryptonetworks, with their open-source protocols and everyone-owned networks, offers the opportunity to restructure the Internet into a system that benefits more people around the world. This is a vision worth striving for.The world evolving today is increasingly controlled by technology, so we must design systems that benefit the collective. The transformation of the Internet, from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0, is diverse and will change the way we interact with the Internet.",

Swash also plans to introduce a suite of data science and developer tools later this year, so developers and businesses can build on top of the platform.\n\nGiant internet companies like to hoard the data we all produce, which has been called the crude oil of the digital economy. Tools like the Swash browser extension, which is currently being used by over 64,000 people, let users take control of their data and receive a passive income from it.\n\nUser adoption for the browser over the past several months has been faster than expected, according to Swash chief marketing officer Chloe Diamond. \u201cIt means our mission resonates with everyday people. It takes a couple of minutes and once you\u2019ve installed the browser application it basically captures your data while you use the internet,\u201d Diamond said in an interview.\n\nSwash user data is then aggregated into a Data Union, where buyers \u2013 ranging from advertising and brand awareness firms to hedge funds \u2013 can purchase it. The profits are distributed to the Data Union members. A SWASH token will soon be introduced to handle these sorts of transactions, among other things, Diamond said, but for now it\u2019s paid using Streamr DATA tokens, an early partner of Swash.\n\n\u201cUntil deciding to do this ecosystem expansion, it didn\u2019t make that much sense for us to have a SWASH token, whereas now it does,\u201d Diamond said. \u201cObviously, timing depends on things like the launchpad exchanges, but it will be this year.\u201d\n\nAs well as Streamr, Swash has been working closely with [Ocean Protocol](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/10/27/ocean-v3-brings-wave-of-data-monetization-tools-to-ethereum/), the decentralized data market infrastructure firm, particularly on the business-to-business and data science side of things.\n\n\u201cWe see that the mission of Swash aligns very closely with Ocean,\u201d Ocean Protocol founder Bruce Pon (also an advisor to Swash) said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting people\u2019s data in a way that has their consent and has the conditions of how they feel comfortable to share the data while providing an economic incentive for them to do so.\u201d\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/27/blockchain-startup-swash-raises-4m-to-make-data-monetization-click/](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/27/blockchain-startup-swash-raises-4m-to-make-data-monetization-click/)\n\nJoin Our Community - [https://www.reddit.com/r/Swash\\_App/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Swash_App/)\n\n**Let\u2019s connect:**[ Twitter](https://twitter.com/swashapp) |[ Telegram](https://t.me/swashapp_group) |[ Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Swash_App/) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/swashapp) | [Website](https://swashapp.io/) | [Newsletter](https://swashapp.io/newsletter)",

They have basically said, it is not a Binance address, even though they are a CEX, the address is on BSC and the funds cannot be frozen (This recent thread may contradict this statement unfortunately: https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/nvlkk6/stolen_funds_sitting_in_binance_wallets_and_no/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).\n\nThey didn't even bother to trace the hacker/scammer and the transactions nor provide any insight on what may have happened from the issues I have raised in terms of security of their entity TrustWallet.\n\nDidn't even mention they will keep track of the address(es) and if the BNB/funds end up in Binance itself, they will take further action. They did state, the initial address I provided has been blacklisted even though by the time they responded, the funds were transferred elsewhere. To me, they are complicit to these hacks/scams in many indirect ways and for the way they treat these matters of their customers that use their platforms.\n\nTheir response was 30 to 36 hours late if not more, the words stolen, scammed, hacked, should have triggered their support algorithm and respond faster than the timeframe they did due to the sensitive nature of the subject at hand.\n\nThe initial support estimated response time the ticket was created stood at 6 hours or less.\n\nI am going to move all my vast amounts of mainstream coins from Binance such as BTC, ETH (staked but will take the BETH), ADA, XRP, XMR, Polkadot, VET etc. etc. And move it to another of my Trezors ordered and on the way, will not hurt them one bit but for me, will feel safer (They did refund everyone the last time they got hacked but don't want the hassle after what's happened with TW, and yes I did know when I first signed up. Most of the assets are in cold storage, same as Coinbase etc).\n\nAm not a Trustwallet customer, never again and will try to avoid the temptation of using Binance and/or its several umbrella entities no matter a leader or not in the space. ETH 2.0 coming up and fees will be dealt with, not sure what will happen to Binance then and whether they will fork it further.\n\n*iOS also announced that the TrustWallet dApp browser will no longer be supported on their devices as it does not meet their guidelines, what a surprise!* Good for them as I have come to the conclusion after all the OPSEC I carried out to protect myself as per their suggested guidelines and my own, was not and will never be enough. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN NO MATTER WHAT!\n\nMetamask has never given me such issues, to point out and neither all the other wallets I have had this far, only TW. Not saying they are more secure or otherwise, just haven't experienced the scenario I have with TW.\n\nI felt better today, since morning, thanks to all of you kind people on Reddit, specifically those that have helped to upvote this for visibility (Even though at the top and Binance clearly saw it but decided to respond many hours later though chat) and the kind comments. Including an acquaintance who is an Ethereum security risk analyst who after I spoke to dawned a few ideas in my mind.\n\nI have decided that as these providers won't do nothing, such as Binance and TrustWallet and help people like myself and others then we as a community should do something ourselves.\n\n*This really devastated me via emotions, left me literally numb at some point where the mind acted in self-defense mode and felt nothing in the end. Am fed up with the way these major platforms act and treat and not protect the same people that make them billions year after year! All welcoming when you bring your money in and will take it instantly but want nothing to do with you when you are in the dark and need help and desperate for assistance!\n\nWell, now I have a plan which is at its infancy as of today but intricate nonetheless. Will use my remaining disposable income and knowledge to produce a sophisticated platform to protect myself and others from these scams/hackers as much as possible on the BSC and ETH network and do the job that Binance and TrustWallet should be doing themselves to protect us before and after we end up in this position.\n\nIf you would like to be part or contribute via knowledge or expertise somehow at your free time, let me know, open to all information, am funding it all. Further details to come.*\n******\n\nEdit 20:57 GMT (thread tidy up): Some comments are very difficult to read, would have really liked to reply to everyone, but can't deal with seeing certain assumptions made and things being said right now, too hurtful after what has happened to me, I feel numb, don't wish this on anyone. Am mentally drained today and not in the right thought process, I apologise if I haven't replied to all of you. \n\nThanks for the support all, also for the comforting words from most of you, and upvotes for visibility, *Binance still haven't got back to me and whether the wallet in question has been frozen for investigation.*\n\nWill update soon, just need to unwind somehow right now. No, am not karma farming, you will never see this account comment elsewhere again to prove so. Really sorry for the long thread, some very important information though, especially if you are new. Please try to read it for knowledge please.\n\n\n--- Original thread ---\n\nDon't know how much roughly, but possibly \u00a3150,000 taken from my TrustWallet which had max wallets totaling 15 wallets. This seems to started happening 4 hours ago whilst I was asleep. (As I had so many wallets in one TrustWallet and some tokens have no pricing updated, the money possibly less) Just one one of my TrustWallet wallets tokens had reached nearly \u00a3500,000 previously and had a lot of potential as you can see).\n\nOne wallet fine but all wallets (Seedphrases needed for every wallet setup in Trustwallet)? How?? I need answers please!\n\nI had the max number of wallets, 15 wallets on my Trustwallet! How can someone obtain all 15 wallet seedphrases? Makes no sense to me whatsoever!\n\nI had a pin, fingerprint lock, signed transactions activated! How can someone take my money? Never shared my seedphrases! Trustwallet email response was not appropriate. All my funds transferred to a BSC address, my assets sold for BNB! Please help me, please!\n\nAlready sent messages to Binance to freeze the wallet that sold my assets for BNB, and also transferred all the BNB from my wallets from the main TrustWallet. They transferred all the BNB to their wallet.\n\nVery confused when I had max security on the Trustwallet, just so confused.\n\nI really need urgent help!\n\nPlease!\n\n--- Original thread end ---\n\nEdit (Wallets information): ***As people are saying this is fake, which am a little hurt by but I understand, this is Crypto, and everything needs to be transparent and public. My wallets are included at the bottom and also the address that took my money and assets from me. If this Solidifies the case then so be it. All this information has already been given to Binance, still waiting for a response. Wanted to release the info after the response from Binance but will do so now, please spread it as much as you can, would really appreciate it.\n\nEDIT 1: Please, please upvote for visibility so Binance can respond. \n\nTrustWallet is owned by Binance and was acquired a while ago. \n\nThey should be able to freeze the wallet/wallets of person that stole my money and an investigation to take place. If it happened to me then it may happen to you, God forbid. With max security setup, one wallet I understand ok but all maxed wallets on Trustwallet? \n\nMakes no sense to me, and need answers... Please upvote, thank you! I will provide anything to prove I own the TrustWallet in question.\n\nEdit 2: As per a comment from another redditor, this should concern all of us, security is very important. \n\nI had maxed security setup for this TrustWallet. Biometrics/PIN to view seedphrase/nowhere else stored to be accessed, and biometrics/PIN for any transactions made. \n\nI am left bewildered on how the aforementioned can be breached. Had max wallets on the Trustwallet, so one wallet to be wiped, fair enough but all wallets?? \n\nI have many other wallets and this is the only one that got wiped, even cold wallets, 3 Trezors, not ledgers as we all know of the data leak. I am clued on security, not a novice. Thanks for the upvotes thus far!\n\nEdit 3: TrustWallet needs a whitelist addresses/devices options within the app too for any transactions that take place, just like Binance which I have activated when I opened the account with them and just like some other well known wallets I have, this can avoid so many issues such as these.\n\nAlso 2 factor authentication such as Google authentication is lacking.\n\nNo such options within the TrustWallet app currently.\n\nIf this gets enough visibility, we can push for the above security measures to be implemented. Trustwallet should not be an exception to these security measures!\n\nEdit 4: Never used PC for this wallet, only a phone especially for TrustWallet due to the amount in question. Biometrics setup on the phone etc.\n\nAny URLs, such as PanCakeSwap I access to make purchases or sales, always log out from after and clear cache through preferences and history. This is standard procedures.\n\nEdit 5: As per a comment, whether there was a random airdrop that I interacted with. No!\n\nThat is a form of a possible \"Dusting\" attack, please do not interact with Airdrops that randomly appear in your wallets, usually worth peanuts or nothing at all, I know it's tempting! Please just disable or never activate them! Do not not interact in any way with those tokens.\n\nI am aware of this, like I said, not a novice.\n\nEdit 6: No I have not interacted with a phishing website! I have had so many messages and forms to fill in to share my seed phrase since I have posted this and links to visit which obviously haven't. Block is the only option when someone randomly messages you! Even Binance support users have been setup to scam me.\n\nETH network has various reference codes where it even provides an insight to contracts that contain malicious code (BSC is a fork of ETH). This information is publicly available to be used in order to check said contracts for malicious code to avoid being scammed. \n\nThis also includes due diligence from our part and knowledge of solidity code sometimes, even checking the contract and seeing what the owner can and cannot do.\n\nDue diligence/research such as, the team, the background, is there DeFi KYC (Private doxxing), what are they attempting to solve and bring new in the space, what is their roadmap, do they have a finished product to be viewed, checked and tested by the community, what are the flaws, do they have backing from a solidified third-party, is it a charity project meaning \"this what want we to do, pay for it and we will get it done\". \n\nThe CEO and owner reputation, their way of speaking and language used, immature? Stay away! Legit non copied Whitepaper with essential information. This is what I can think of right now and that is just the tip of the iceberg as there is so much more.\n\nIs it audited by an official source? Remember that the large percentage of people just want to know that the audit was done but never usually check it. *Audits are an ongoing process, not a once off, as bugs and issues need to be fixed and it keeps being audited until it is completely free of issues*, please remember this.\n\nThere are also sites such as rugscreener, tokensniffer, bsccbeck (if it decides to work) etc. to make standard checks at a glance for those not knowledgeable in solidity code for various scams such as honeypots, wallets unlocked, LP locked or not, rugs etc. USE THEM BEFORE INVESTING! Like I said, am aware of security, when you are parting with your money, all checks have to be made.\n\nAm not one to be scammed so easily and this has left me literally so confused, and want to know how this happened as cannot figure it out but guess what? Binance can and want details so they fix this issue and strengthen their security for all of us!\n\nEdit 7: Any access required to a wallet such as from PanCakeSwap and DAPPs only should require read only access and transactions to be authorised prior to being fully connected.  No other exclusive permissions were granted and neither should be requested by any dApp.\n\nI have provided Binance all the details needed already. I will update this once I hear back from them for the community and for the sake of transparency and what their reply was.\n\nTrustwallets reply was essentially \"Sorry for your loss, please take these security measures in future\", but the measures in question were already taken, maximum there is but it is lacking as mentioned in \"Edit 3\" which have to implemented.\n\nAm not using any other TrustWallet right now, personally, moved most of my assets elsewhere from my other TrustWallets, can't risk it. \n\nPlease be very careful with your assets! If they can bypass this then surely there is a serious security flaw for someone to obtain 15 wallet seed phrases from one TrustWallet in some way.\n\nEdit 8: Some information from comments on this thread that popped up to me, which may be further useful to you guys.\n\nDon't ever purchase anything or ever go to transfer tokens randomly from a site given or found anywhere. Check the contract address and obtain it from official sources and creators of the contract if you are to invest, see an opportunity and have done all your checks, even then it is a risk.\n\nAlways know the ticker of the token you're trading and always obtain the \"CONTRACT\" from the original official source.\n\nNever trust random Telegrams groups/posts, or CMS posts (r/CryptoMoonShots), r/MarsShots etc. in fact I would say 99.9% are scams from the 200 to 300 tokens released a day!\n\nNear instantly, all tokens are copied and cloned once they are launched, especially all the popular ones, to dupe people. Telegram groups are easily replicated, logos and names changed without any barriers. \n\nAlways double check the usernames and compare them to the official social channels and URLs in browsers if you navigate to projects sites and ensure a valid SSL certificate is installed (green padlock) etc.\n\nYou will surprised, how many social channels are replicated too and slight change of one character is added to the usernames  to scam People.\n\nAnd no, unfortunately Doxxing means nothing for some projects!\n\nGo look up \"SliceOfThePie\", for a recent \"Doxxed\" project that scammed people. Be very, very, careful!\n\nI have fallen for rugpulls myself in the past, never can be too safe in terms of investing and no matter how much research you do, you can be a victim but precautions can be taken, some as shared above.\n\nEdit 9: No matter what I provide, it seems people will always ask for more and am sure whatever I say or details I provide, more answers will be asked for which is fine.\n\nI don't want anyone else to end up in the same boat, so here are some other responses people are seeking. Will try to update and answer any other questions.\n\nIt is an Android phone, not an old brick, I wouldn't buy a \u00a3300 phone for assets large as these or small for any of my wallets or not take appropriate procedures to secure my assets such as not using third party browsers, only for trading, usually PCS/inbuilt but check my OPSEC for that in my other edits. \n\nAll my phone's for crypto wallets which have substantial amounts have their own phones. No other apps apart from the wallets themselves. \n\nNot rooted, nor do I have jailbroken iPhones or modded APK'S. I do not use public networks, the packets sent over those, can be infiltrated and information stolen/seen by hackers. \n\nMy networks are private and the setup is such that no public network is allowed to access the phones network and interact with it, airplane mode has to be switched on when not in use regardless, for extra OPSEC measures which I have forgotten about some times overnight if an using that particular phone but that is not a big issue as failing on other important parts is more detrimental.\n\nThe phone has never been connected to any laptop or PC ever, no need. Please, if you read my thread and comments, am not a noob when it comes to OPSEC. All I want is visibility and answer from Binance and to recover my funds.

PUMP token, HODL, HashPanda, SafePlayground, NaruDo, Ghostface: yeah I would buy none of these tokens ever.\n\nOn further research, I analyzed that two of these tokens: HODL and Ghostface are complete scams and are designed to steal money from your wallet. That scammer's address you shared isn't a scammer, it belongs to the developers of HODL. I need to do some more research to back this, but there are a couple of posts highlighting the scamming nature of HODL and Ghostface.\n\nEDIT: I take it back. It appears that while the developers take some % of the profits, they don't take all of it. After inspecting your other wallets (which also have shitcoins like HakunaMatata, BNB Diamond, HAPPY and what not), I can see the hacker basically sold all of your coins to BNB and ran away with it. The only explanation that comes to mind now is that you possibly had your device compromised by downloading some malware. Since you use Android, it isn't quite unheard of.",

            "text": "$SPARTA (23M mcap) is the $SNX (2B mcap) on BinanceSmartChain and will lead the bullrun 2021!\n\nTeaser: The Spartan Protocol combines UniSwap, THORChain, Synthetix and MakerDAO features, but will be launched on Binance Smart Chain as its own separate protocol. The most powerful product is the synthetic assets on Binance Smart Chain which boosted SNX on Ethereum from 10M mcap to 2B mcap (x200) within 1 year. The Synthetics launch is expected in Q1 2021 on Binance Smart Chain.\n\nStats: Ticker: $SPARTA\n\nCirculating Supply: 62M\n\nPrice: 40 cents (30 cents was the entry price from the early supporters)\n\nMcap: 24.8M mcap\n\nExchange: Binance\n\nTokenomics:\n\n* No seed / private / public sale investors\n* No advisor tokens\n* No team tokens this will prevent a possible dump\n\nTeam: Its lead by former of Binance Chain projects.\n\nInitial Start Price: The initial value of SPARTA was set at $0.30 per token, meaning most current token holders paid $0.30 per token, where it\u2019s currently trading at $0.38. New ATH's and price discovery's coming.\n\nCZ CEO of Binance highlighted Spartan Protocol:\n\n[www.youtube.com/watch?time\\_continue=4610&v=8vg-6mMdHYo&feature=emb\\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4610&v=8vg-6mMdHYo&feature=emb_logo)\n\nDescription:\n\nThe Spartan Protocol is a protocol for incentives liquidity and synthetic assets (assets pegged to the price of another asset) on the Binance Smart Chain. The core piece of the protocol are liquidity pools, similar to Uniswap, but instead of a fixed-rate fee model a liquidity-sensitive fee model similar to THORChain\u2019s slip-based fees is used.\n\nCurrently, liquidity providers (and traders) are penalised on automated-market maker protocols, such as Uniswap, because of manipulation from value-extracting arbitrage bots. These arbitrage bots have been around for a long time now, and suck up millions of liquidity from unknowing users on a weekly basis.\n\nAs well as, synthetic mining protocols such as MakerDao and Synthetic use illiquid collateral/markets to liquidate collateral on, which makes it vulnerable to a downwards spiral which has already caused multiple chain liquidations in the past.\n\nSpartan wants to solve these issues through an AMM protocol, through the use of a single settlement asset and protocol-wide incentives to grow liquidity. A slip-based fees model is used to reward liquidity providers rather than slippage bots, a solution discussed and researched a lot by THORchain. Finally, collateralised pool shares (synthetic assets) are used instead of liquid collateral. Synthetic assets are generated through the protocol, using price anchors offered by the liquidity pools, collaterised by liquidity pool shares. These shares are on-market, value-stabilised and can instantly be liquidated. Thanks to this, positions can be liquidated within causing downwards spirals.\n\nThe protocol aims to be community-driven and therefore uses a DAO (governance) set-up for fee rates, time factors and upgrades of certain parts of the code (voted on by holders who get incentivised to do so). But, doesn\u2019t overcomplicate governance or sets high requirements for any proposal to pass.\n\nBecause the protocol was built on the Binance Smart Chain, BNB is required to use the protocol and pay for fees. Similar to how ETH is used to pay for gas on the Ethereum Network.\n\nSummarised, I got interested in Spartan Protocol because:\n\nIt took the best parts from the most popular AMM protocols, combined them and created a very solid protocol by doing so. The protocol was launched on the Binance Smart Chain, which is a very unique value proposition at this point, subject to Binance exposure. Higher leverage, lower fees and much faster then $SNX. The SpartanDAO is build directly on smart contracts.\n\nWebsite: [https://spartanprotocol.org](https://spartanprotocol.org/) NEW WEBSITE JUST LAUNCHED\n\nApp: [www.pools.spartanprotocol.org](http://www.pools.spartanprotocol.org/)\n\n[https://spartanprotocol.medium.com/how-to-swap-in-spartanpools-1c1e5faa0d95](https://spartanprotocol.medium.com/how-to-swap-in-spartanpools-1c1e5faa0d95)",

            "text": "**Dear Binancians**\n\nThis thread has been created to address the spamming of new threads regarding \u2018Dust\u2019 and Withdrawal fees - Potentially other issues that may arise in the future will also be addressed here.\n\nThis is to reduce spam on our reddit and to encourage productive discussion.  \nIt is extremely discouraging for any new user to join this reddit and see 50+ threads addressing the same topic.\n\n---\n\n**Dust**\n\n  The first thing we would like to address is the influx of threads regarding the \u2018Dust\u2019 accumulation in your accounts. We have previously stated a few times around the reddit that this is something we are aware of and something that we are working on a feature for. However, quite a few users expect this to be added overnight. So I will try to explain the complexity of this situation to help you understand why this may be a larger process than you realise.  Currently, there are a large number of listed coins on Binance - The proposed feature suggested by many members is sweeping all the dust to BNB. This would theoretically require an immediate and automatic market sell of up to (x) coins at the same time.  You can see how this may take some time to develop. \n\n----\n**Withdrawal Fees**\n\nSecondly, In regards to withdrawal fees, we have recently released our dynamic withdrawal fees - A few users are making threads stating that the current fees are unacceptable.  In order to address this, we must first look at the Ethereum blockchain. This image (http://prntscr.com/hyrjmm) shows the growth of Ethereum transactions since the release of Ethereum.  You can see that recently there has been an exponential increase in the volume of transactions occurring on the Ethereum Blockchain. What this means is that transaction fees are very competitive right now. If you want your transaction to be prioritised, you are required to pay higher miner fees.  Our dynamic system is configured to set the fees to the equivalent of 0.01 ETH/ withdrawal.  This amount does not change based on the quantity you withdraw in one withdrawal because on blockchain, a $50 transfer paying a $5 fee is treated the exact same as a $500,000 transfer paying a $5 fee.  \n\n---\n**China's New Regulations**\n\nBinance is not a Chinese exchange - We are a global exchange and these regulations will have no effect on Binance\n\n---\n**Lost 2FA**\n\nIf you no longer have access to your 2FA code for some reason, please follow the instructions to [reset your 2FA here.](https://support.binance.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003585911-How-to-reset-Google-2FA) \n\n---\n\n**Google Translate Button**\n\nWe have recently added a google translate button to the website. This addition was to ensure that all users are able to use Binance in their native language.\n\n--- \n**Please note** \n\nAny further threads created regarding items addressed in this thread will be removed. \n\n\nThis is not a support thread, If you have submitted a ticket please wait for support to respond to you via the official ticketing system\n\n**Reminder**\n \nBinance no longer offers support via Telegram. If you require support, please submit a [support ticket](https://support.binance.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and our support team will get to your ticket as soon as possible. \n\n\n\nAll discussion regarding these items is to be done in this thread alone.",

Now the coins are missing.\n\nI had put in a buy order of 1761 XRP for .15 BTC on Jan 09.\n\n01-09 11:57:39 XRP/BTC Limit Buy -- 0.00008500 -- 1,761.00 -- -- Canceled\n\nThat is the transaction. The transaction was never completed. When I made it, my BTC used moved to \"in order\" and it stayed there. When it was canceled, I had neither XRP nor BTC credited to me. The \"in order\" just disappeared and never went to my BTC balance. The sucky part is, the trade would have completed yesterday as XRP was that low!\n\nBinance canceled this transaction, but never credited my \"in order\" BTC back! I never canceled this transaction. My intention was to leave it until XRP reached that amount, or I would cancel it myself if it never went below 12k sats. it comes out to about .15 BTC. I have sent numerous support tickets but they all get auto resolved. I have PM'd the mods here but nobody answers. I have posted in various threads but no help given. This is about $2k USD missing from my binance account that they never credited back to me after canceling my buy limit order.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do? Any mods help? I tried telegram but they canceled that support system.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI tried the recovery method outlined by the mods of creating fake sell/buy orders with ridiculous amounts but didn't work.\n",

Yes, the team is interested in delivering easy to understand concepts about the project and has placed a total prize of $5000 in CVP for the five categories that will be featured, the details of the contest are available [here](https://twitter.com/powerpoolcvp/status/1381888768878243843)\n\nThe contest will also feature as a hiring process for the tops in two categories, the infographics and writing sections. With $2,500 allocated to these sections, we will see five winners from each section of the competition. **T&C apply**\n\nIn boosting the token value of CVP, the team has implemented a proposal passed by the community to limit the inflation of the native token, CVP and this will see a reduction in the reward for CVP across all index pool of the project.\n\nOther Powerpool indexes are PIPT, YLA, YETI and ASSY.\n\n[Website](http://powerindex.io/)\n\n[Twitter](http://twitter.com/powerpoolcvp)\n\n[Medium](http://medium.com/powerpool)\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/PowerPoolTrading)\n\n[Forum](http://gov.powerpool.finance/)",

As of today, BNB has the HIGHEST market cap it has ever held, even in the crypto rage era. Its BTC/BNB value is also light years higher than it has ever been in that era, or ever.\n\nSomething's happening here guys. I'm not just an excited BNB holder who is shilling a coin, I'm just observing and scratching my head. \n\n\n\nI don't think ANY coin is as close to its ATH during that era as BNB is. And when we pass that, I believe the world will see this and realize something valuable is brewing in Binance's offices. ",

            "text": "First, we\u2019ll tell you why we decided so, and then, how it will affect our project and farming.\n\n**Why did we choose Binance Smart Chain to launch?**\n\n1. Incredible fees on Ethereum. To swap on Uniswap you need to pay $ 20- $ 50, transfer NFT \u2014 $ 15- $ 20, add $ 60- $ 150 to the pool. If you have millions of dollars, this may not be a big commission for you, but for everyone else, it is disastrously large amounts. On Binance Smart Chain, you will pay $ 0.15- $ 0.3 for the same transactions.\n2. Time. It turns out that many projects are now almost paralyzed. Due to the huge fees, users stop using many Dapps. Especially in NFT. Although this is a trend, no one wants to overpay x10-x30. Therefore, instead of L2 solutions, expecting a drop in the price of ETH and the launch of ETH 2.0, we want to make a product here and now. Binance Smart Chain brings these capabilities.\n3. Minimal changes in the smart contract. We do not need to redo the logic, we just change pools, exchanges and are ready to launch.\n4. The NFT market is not well developed on Binance Smart Chain. We analyzed and saw BSC is much less competitive. While there are already many players in the NFT market on Ethereum, the BSC market is almost free. This opens up great opportunities for our project! I compared BEP-721 vs ERC-721 tokens - 106 BEP vs 8695 ERC. The difference is huge! I see a lot of potential in BSC for the entire NFT market.\n5. Development of NFT bridges between ETH <=> BSC. This opens up the opportunity to create bridges between the two blockchains, so even Ethereum fans can uselessly use the products on the BSC.\n\n**What will change in our project?**\n\nAs we said, the code is the same on the two blockchains. The only thing is that we will change the pools (now there will be 5 instead of 18) and DEX for creating trading pairs (instead of Uniswap we will use PancakeSwap)  \n\n\n* Pools for farming \u2014 BNB, CAKE, USDT, BUSD, ETH\n* Pairs will be created on PancakeSwap \u2014 NFTL / BNB and CTF / BNB\n\nThe launch date remains the same \u2014 February 25th. Farming has become much closer at BSC!\n\nWe have reflected all changes in our Docs file [https://docs.cybertime.finance](https://docs.cybertime.finance/)\n\nFarming site \u2014 [https://cybertime.farm](https://cybertime.farm/)  \nTelegram \u2014 [https://t.me/cybertime\\_eth](https://t.me/cybertime_eth)  \nTwitter \u2014 [https://twitter.com/cybertime\\_eth](https://twitter.com/cybertime_eth)",

Polygon is seeing a lot of ecosystem growth with the likes of 1inch, OpenSea, Sushiswap, Curvfi, Aave expanding to the network. Having to withdraw it as an ERC-20 token and then using the bridge is a pain, since one has to pay Ethereum gas fees twice, including Binance's additional withdrawal cut. Being able to withdraw to Matic network directly would be amazing. >! I see no reason for such Ethereum L2s to be directly integrated other than BSC Maximalism. !<",

It is the leading DAPP on BSC and the 3rd most popular DAPP across all blockchains as ranked by active users (according to dappradar).\n\nPancakeswap is a faster, cheaper version of Uniswap with more features (lottery, farms, game mechanics). There are also plans to allow borrowing/lending, and long term staking for bonus APY.  So that would essentially be Compound and Uniswap combined... with 20\u00a2 fees instead of $20 fees. This platform has the makings of a tier 1 blockchain app and I have heard very little buzz around it. The subreddit [r/pancakeswap](https://www.reddit.com/r/pancakeswap/) has less than 300 followers, but with relative obscurity comes great opportunity.\n\nPancakeswap is currently offering 140% APY on their native token, CAKE. The token has risen 600% in the past month and is now a top 100 token with no signs of slowing. **The major caveat** here is that Binance is largely controlled by a corporation and therefore is less decentralized than Ethereum. Fair point. To be clear, I'm also holding a moonbag of BNB and it hasn't failed me yet.\n\nTLDR: Check out Pancakeswap. They're potentially Uniswap but better. 140% APY on a token that's gone up 600% in the last month and is now top 100.",

Do you agree?\n\nIf you agree with that, please deposit 0.2 ETH to your account firstly, and please send us the address you would like to receive your funds back (Please make sure the address can accept the ERC 20 AION token)\n\nWe will forward your request to the technical team after getting your confirmation and receiving address. They will handle your issue as soon as possible.

Look at the chat log...Now you are saying you lost my $350 AION? And you want to charge me to try to fiz your own error!!!!This is unacceptable, even if you get it back i will more than likely miss the 11/30/18 deadline now because i followed your instructions!!!!You need to reimburse me for my loss or get me my tokens, its your error. I have these logs captured and will send to the AION team for solution and negative feedback.\n\nPlease provide a remedy to this situation.\n\nmlippold",

Maybe I will come back to you if your fees become fair. \n\nTo put it in perspective I realised I totalled around 15 withdrawals which added up to 0.15 Ether... Thats crazy...",

I\u2019m talking about small business ventures that operate as brokers or trading funds. The break even on a purchase of 100$ is just impossible if you have under 2% fee.",

All of the current elected Validators take a commission of 25%, leaving 75% to be shared amongst all delegators.\n\nStake your BNB with 0% commission for the highest APY!\n\nHowever we realize this won\u2019t necessarily generate enough delegation for us to achieve elected status, therefore we propose an unprecedented ratio \u2014 because this isn\u2019t about making a profit for us \u2014 rather we want to be part of the BSC ecosystem.\n\nTo this end, we will simply charge just ZERO commission, meaning all delegators receive a share of 100% of the rewards generated, providing the highest possible returns to receive from staking BNB on Binance Smart Chain.\n\nThis is a highly attractive proposition that we hope will attract your investment so that you can join us in supporting the revolutionary BSC initiative whilst enjoying the maximum possible rewards!\n\nHow to delegate your BNB in a few easy clicks\n\n1. First, you need a Binance Chain Wallet, containing the BNB you wish to stake.\n2. To delegate your BNB to the Ankr Validator visit [Binance | Binance Smart Chain | Binance Staking | Binance Swap | Binance.org](https://www.binance.org/en/staking/validator/bva1xnudjls7x4p48qrk0j247htt7rl2k2dzp3mr3j) and connect your Binance Chain wallet.\n3. Once you connected your wallet you can delegate your BNB to our Validator, by clicking the \\[Delegate\\] button in the top right corner.\n\nFor the first time delegating, this may take a few days to be confirmed, but then once in place, you can simply connect your wallet to view your stake and accumulated rewards!\n\nOnce we receive enough delegated BNB we will appear in the top 21 of the Elected Nodes list here: [Binance | Binance Smart Chain | Binance Staking | Binance Swap | Binance.org](https://www.binance.org/en/staking).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/stszenpcpsl61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26b23c3d8c5b5f3afdc70bae7a4768736fbc00cf",

From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from books to our weekly Moonshot Monday podcast. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)\n\nIt\u2019s been a busy week for us researching new moonshots for you. After ploughing through hundreds if not thousands of micro cap projects we selected seven that we felt had a good chance of major success. Three of our favorites we have included in today\u2019s list.\n\nIt is always nice to have some new moonshots that we feel excited about. The list we have established here has a good selection of quality projects some of which have already been recognized by the market, other projects such as Rentible, Candela and our two new picks haven\u2019t been, yet.\n\nIt is important, doesn\u2019t matter how strongly you feel about a particular project, to spread your risk among a portfolio of projects which is the message we are trying to get over with our own **Monthly Moonshot Portfolio**.\n\nSo with all that said let\u2019s see how our list did this week. It was one of our best weeks yet with some of our smaller picks performing exceptionally well.\n\n**The winners this week were:**\n\nEthbox +133%\n\nRentible +115%\n\nHaven +63%\n\n**And the losers, of which there were only a few:**\n\nRarible - 8%\n\nUno Re -6%\n\nPIVX - 5%\n\nThe three new additions in this week\u2019s list were:\n\n**DAPS -** [**https://coingecko.com/en/coins/daps-coin/**](https://coingecko.com/en/coins/daps-coin/)\n\nDAPS is a privacy coin that aims to be the most private and secure privacy coin on the market. What makes DAPS special is that it claims to be the first to solve the \"trust problem\" for fully private chains with their own Proof of Audit algorithm which audits the chain for any abnormalities without compromising it\u2019s anonymity features.\n\nDAPS appears to have a robust platform having been audited by Red4Sec. It also has a healthy sized community of loyal supporters.\n\nDAPS is a project that is clearly under the radar especially when you look at the valuation of some of its competitors, including TurtleCoin, which was a tip of ours a few months ago, which has a fully diluted valuation of $110 million compared to DAPS\u2019 $1.7 million.\n\n**Faceter**\n\nIn the next 3 years over 1 billion cameras will be installed across the globe, producing petabytes of video recordings daily. Faceter is designed to perform big data video analysis in real time \u2013 extracting faces, objects and events resulting in the transformation of these meaningless recordings into meaningful assets.\n\nFACE token is the core of the decentralized network as a flexible, transparent, cross-border settlement mechanism for all participants. Starting with the payments they receive from customers who want to use Faceter for video analysis. Work of miners in their decentralized network is also paid by FACE.\n\nFaceter has found a potentially lucrative niche which has so far remained unexplored particularly in the blockchain space. With a market cap of $2.5 million, fully diluted $4.8 million, this project is both undervalued and undiscovered. It is a project that deserves significantly more attention.\n\n**Libertas**\n\nLibertas is a decentralized audio and podcast streaming service built on the Ethereum Blockchain.\n\nThe Libertas Project was born out of passion for free speech. It\u2019s a way to allow people to have a platform without fear of being deleted, banned or deplatformed.\n\nLibertas is building a platform dedicated to decentralising the spoken word, to allow freedom of speech to continue unhindered, to help those who have lost their voice reclaim it and to stop censorship from becoming a way of life.\n\nAnyone will be able to upload their podcast and it cannot be taken down due to the immutable nature of the blockchain. Anyone from any country, including countries where freedom of speech is not protected and is not recognised as a right, will be able to have their voice heard.\n\nLibertas is a commendable project. With big tech banning users for little or no reason but based on the whims of some discriminatory algorithm there is a need for a solution where users own their data and their content. There are many platforms emerging in the blockchain space to imitate Facebook and Twitter but nothing really in the podcast arena. Libertas\u2019 platform is a little clunky at the moment but will only improve. Its market cap of $1.5 million makes this a perfect time to buy into this promising project. The price is already up nearly 100% since we first discovered it under a week ago.\n\n**Forthcoming AMA**\n\nWe have the team at Libertas appearing on our Telegram channel for an AMA this Wednesday at 12pm EST 5pm GMT. Please join us here to participate [Telegram: Join Group Chat](https://t.me/joinchat/htKJi3PkuyJiM2U5)\n\n**Removals**\n\nA bit of spring cleaning is always a good thing when you have a portfolio of investments. This week that involved swapping PIVX with DAPS. We had a decent run with PIVX recently and we think DAPS offers more upside.\n\nFinally we removed AdEx. Again we have seen some nice gains here recently and with a market cap of $77 million there is better value to be found elsewhere.\n\n**Other goings on and happenings**\n\nWe already touched on our latest article: Unearthing crypto micro cap gems\n\nThere was also another article which we published focusing on moonshots: Six cryptocurrencies worth buying to avoid impending regulation\n\n**You can read our reports and articles here:** [**http://cryptoquestion.tech/reports/**](http://cryptoquestion.tech/reports/)\n\n**Staking and Yield Farming Review**\n\nThis week we searched for the platform and the investments that offered the highest return with the lowest risk. You can check out our findings here together with this week\u2019s list of APRs from leading platforms. Remember this is a list of the highest APR from the given platform.\n\n**To read our weekly Review or access our other free staking resources go to:** [**https://cryptoquestion.tech/staking-and-yield-farming-weekly-review/**](https://cryptoquestion.tech/staking-and-yield-farming-weekly-review/)\n\n**Finally...**\n\nPlease start using our Moonshot forum.

            "text": "HISTORY OF SMART CONTRACT PLATFORMS\n\nLet me just say preface this that I \u2764\ufe0f Ethereum. I am fascinated by its potential as to decentralized finance and smart contracts (and potentially revolutionary impact on our shitty financial system). It could do so much more than Bitcoin. By way of interesting side note, the original Bitcoin code included the capability for smart contracts but after a major exploit was found in that code that allowed the creation of tons of extra Bitcoin and required a hard fork to undo the damage, the smart contract code in Bitcoin was turned off. That decision to not permit smart contracts paved the way for Ethereum. But just as Ethereum rose in prominence to challenge Bitcoin, so have other smart contract platforms risen to try to challenge Ethereum. None are close to Ethereum in terms of actual useful projects up and running mainly because the vast majority of smart contract devs want to build on Ethereum. \n\nLAUNCH OF BINANCE SMART CHAIN\n\nBut Binance, a company headquartered in Malta (although it has undeniable ties to China) that runs a large centralized crypto exchange, has launched its own decentralized* smart contract platform. (*Note: Binance Smart Chain or BSC bills itself as decentralized but given that Binance itself is very centralized and appears to be responsible for a lot of the development on BSC, it is not clear how truly decentralized Binance Smart Chain is.)\n\nA NOTE ON DECENTRALIZATION\n\nThe use of the term decentralization in this context refers to the method of control of a smart contract platform. A centralized platform is controlled by a single entity or person (or group of related entities or group of persons) - for example, Binance's exchange is centralized. It is controlled by a small number of entities who are in turn controlled by a small number of individuals and investors. A decentralized platform, in contrast, is controlled by holders of its governance tokens, who are typically the users of the platform. Various proposals are put up for a vote and the tokenholders can vote on them. At a centralized platform like Binance or Coinbase, decisions are not made by users of the platform. Read more about [decentralization versus centralization](https://www.publish0x.com/decentralizedfinance/why-does-depositing-crypto-on-decentralized-finance-platform-xykdenp).\n\nAs I mentioned the vast majority of smart contract development is occurring on Ethereum, which has been around for over five years. But Binance has managed in a relatively short period of time to create a serviceable smart contract platform called Binance Smart Chain. When I first heard about BSC, I was quite skeptical. I didn't like the concept of a centralized entity like Binance basically masquerading as decentralized and winning over a large share of the market. (Similar concerns to some of my issues with [venture capital and DeFi](https://www.publish0x.com/decentralizedfinance/three-reasons-to-be-very-wary-of-venture-capital-in-defi-xwqozgk).) Because Binance itself is centralized and has a lot of money to throw around, it can move a lot faster to play catch up. In a pretty short amount of time BSC has lapped many smart contract competitors and has made significant strides in catching up to Ethereum.\n\nI am not directly addressing whether Binance Smart Chain is truly decentralized because I honestly don't know. But use of BSC does benefit Binance itself (for one thing you need to use BNB, Binance's token, to pay fees on Binance Smart Chain) and it brings people into the Binance ecosystem, which again benefits the centralized (and, in my opinion, often predatory) Binance. In some ways, it does not matter whether BSC is decentralized or not if it brings significant benefit to an entity that we know is centralized. That's not even to mention the fact that many people have asserted that Binance is essentially a Chinese company, regardless of the fact that it is incorporated, and its headquarters are located, outside China. If this is true, then Binance, like other Chinese companies, may be expected to do the bidding of the Chinese government. That may be an ethical concern for some people. \n\nINITIAL EXPERIENCE AND OPINION ON BINANCE SMART CHAIN\n\nIn spite of my hesitation I was drawn into trying BSC by a few events. The first was the airdropping by Ellipsis Finance (BSC's clone of Curve) of EPS to holders of Curve's veCRV. I set up Binance Smart Chain on my Metamask wallet and seeded my wallet with some BNB (Binance's token, which you need to pay fees on BSC). Then I headed over to Ellipsis and claimed my EPS token based on having veCRV in my corresponding Ethereum wallet. They drop the EPS once a week so you have to repeatedly return to claim it (perhaps to create a habit?). And I can't lie - the process was very simple and, most notably, cheap, compared to Ethereum. \n\nOf course BSC can be cheap specifically because it has centralized elements. It doesn't have miners. Ethereum is taking steps to reduce its fees but with thousands of devs and miners it is not as simple a process as it is for Binance. That being said, aside from picking up my airdropped EPS, withdrawing it with a 50% penalty so that I can stake it to earn a lot more EPS (the tokenomics leave my head spinning), there is not too much else going on on Ellipsis at this point. There is, I think, one pool where you can swap BUSD (Binance's stabelcoin) for a few other stablecoins, and there is a place where you can buy EPS. Compare that to Curve which has around 30 different pools where you can swap a large variety of stablecoins as well as equivalent coins (e.g., renBTC for wBTC or stETH for ankrETH, etc), and Curve recently created crv.finance where DeFi protocols can create their own additional pools for swapping.\n\nWhen compared to Curve, there is very little you can actually do on Ellipsis besides collect EPS and earn a metric ton more EPS plus a little BUSD if you lock it. The economic value you get at this stage mainly comes from other people deciding to withdraw their EPS at a penalty so that they too can lock it and make money from later withdrawers. \n\nHere is the link if you'd like to read the rest of my [Binance Smart Chain review](https://www.publish0x.com/decentralizedfinance/the-degens-playground-my-opinion-as-an-ethereum-acolyte-on-b-xerxdxz)\n\nCurious to hear your comments and experiences with BSC.",

            "text": "  \n\n# General Conclusion\n\nLast week, we talked about a possibility of going back to the international gold standard by replacing gold with bitcoin. Today, we are talking about the agrarian society 2.0. I guess history really does repeat itself in new forms!Today, we are talking about yield farming, the modern day agriculture. Instead of harvesting crops, we are harvesting tokens.Yield farming is part of token distribution and user acquisition. It's basically mining tokens by using the protocol (i.e. executing trade). It's attractive because it's possible to get a 100% APY. But it comes with risks.\n\n# 1. Projects Using Yield Farming\n\n* **Sythetix**: issuing SNX tokens to liquidity provider. It worked since sETH tokens make up 1/3 of uniswap's liquidity pool\n* **Curve Finance**: issue native tokens like SNX, REN, BAL, CRV to liquidity providers\n* **Compound**: The total assets under Compound has surpassed Maker, the top DeFi app. It is the primary market for a decentralised money market. Daily COMP tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. It worked since 1 billion new assets entered the Compound market\n* **Balancer**: Weekly BAL tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. Before the distribution, volume had generally been under $2 million. Since the distribution, it has generally been around $4 million. But on Sunday, June 28, volume shot up to $14 million.\n\n# 2. Good Bad Ugly\n\n\\[**Good**\\] **It works.** This native token is an **incentive for liquidity providers**. That is exactly what exchange platforms are doing with their native tokens too, by incentivising market makers. It works for users because they are rewarded with extra tokens. It works of the platform because they are **onboarding new users**.\\[**Good**\\] **Projects** like these are way **beyond** the stage of **just a white paper**. We have a working product that can be used and this is the first step towards getting a user base.\\[**Bad**\\] This is **still a short-term incentive that is not sustainable**. What happens when the hype of trading is gone? Or when transaction fees are too expensive and it makes no economic sense to trade? Or when tokens are all given out?\\[**Bad**\\] So far, it seems like the **yield is a zero-sum game**. If you don't know how to play, you should not participate. It may change in the future by increasing the size of pie, but for now, it is a beautiful zero sum. It means do not be the last sucker standing because you are going to suffer all the losses. If you don\u2019t have insider knowledge or strategic advantage, you are not earning yield. You are the yield.\\[**Ugly**\\] The real ugly part is the **hidden string attached**. Due to all the trade going on on ethereum, gas fees have shot through the roof. So **beware of gas fees, slippage fee, asset volatility.**\\[**Ugly**\\] **Leveraged trading** can be good to secure greater upsides, but the downside can also be quite steep, especially since market is so volatile and you can get squeezed out quickly, if you have all your liquidity tied up in the the defi apps.\\[**Ugly**\\] Because there are so many transactions (that may or may not be inflated), the transaction fees have soared. So, Ethereum is looking to i**ncrease the block size.** This is great for validators in the short run to increase their returns, but this is ugly risk in the long run because **ethereum network can be more vulnerable to attacks on the network.**\n\n# 3. Economics of Yield Farming\n\n* Token Design: Self-Reinforcing Mechanism. The token incentives create liquidity which starts a feedback loop.\n* Valuation: at the end of the day, this method just encourages network effects without providing any real economic value. for protocols and projects to succeed, it depends on builders and users to stay on the platform for a long time, and not just during this movement. In the short term, we are also seeing an increase in token value.\n* Token supply: this is a token supply increase, or supply inflation. It is also distributed to users with the highest volume. Instead of people paying for tokens, it is earned via the platform.\n* Return of tokens: These tokens are not exactly free. early investors of the tokens have invested and receive tokens. they are happy for tokens to increase in value to cash out their returns. unless you have a strategic plan for using tokens to gain returns, you are just part of the plan. (Similar to IPO Pop)\n* Transaction activities: borrowers are keen to borrow more because with the native token distribution, it is almost like they are subsidised to pay. The increase in trading results in higher transaction fees and attracts better returns as lenders.\n\n# Apply To Your Project\n\nThis is a typical method for issuing tokens based on transaction volume, as we see in exchange tokens. Check out the BNB episode for the economics of that.Yield farming is a growth hacking way to achieve network effects. It uses short-term incentives to drive user growth. At the end of the day, we are looking at the bigger game. In the long-run, how sustainable will the platform be. The real economic value comes from building products that benefits users in a sustainable manner, not with hypes and pumps. That means actual financial activity for DeFi protocols, so that monetary value increase is not just driven by \"sophisticated leveraged speculation\" but real value-add.**TLDR**:For crypto-entrepreneurs and long-term investors, yield farming works. But it is still a short-term incentive and not a long-term solution. So use this method with precaution.",

            "text": "Hey guys,\n\nSo in the midst of the markets downturn I've been observing the yield across DeFi protocols sliding as demand weakens across the market for digital assets. I feel like I hear a lot of things about how DeFi will bring crypto into the mainstream, but there's inevitably a long way to go till it has really matured for that stage.\n\nI wanted to get people's thoughts on BSC and DeFi on the network. Obviously it has the backing of Binance & the advantage of being more user friendly due to its low gas costs (as well as being easy to develop on as an EVM compatible chain). Do people see it as a serious player in the DeFi landscape long-term? Personally I see a multi-chain future ahead, but I feel like a lot of people have this 'one or none' prediction in which one network will eventually reign supreme over all others. \n\nAnd to that point more specifically if BSC does exist in a multi-chain future, what of the current DeFi protocols? I feel like the space desperately needed a cleansing of countless forks, but are those currently at the top of the tree (PCS, Beefy, Autofarm, Bunny etc) likely to stay there, or will they eventually be overtaken by newer innovations, whether they're yet to be launched or still unknown to the broader community?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's everyone's opinion? Does Ethereum charge forward and take over (or maybe another chain)? Is there room for multiple networks? What of the DeFi (and more specifically yield farming) space on BSC?",

Don\u00b4t know if ETH (or any other chain) will take over the whole DeFI ecosystem (or the most serious projects), but I do believe it will become some sort of *Primus inter pares* among Block chains.\n\n \r  \nTo me, the projects most likely to succeed long term are those who already have bridges of their tokens among ETH and other networks. As many of us right now, I\u00b4m using Binance while ETH fees calm down, and I\u00b4ve been taking advantage of yield farming with extra-low fees. \n\nWhile I was checking yield farming projects I originally found Pancake, Beefy and  Auto-farm. From Pacake I loved their twitter interactions, their ecosystem and their strong meme game, about Auto I liked the Yield-aggregator concept, and I liked the opportunity of a bridge, just to be let down by not speaking Korean and realizing it is for \u201cHuobi ECO Chain\u201d; unfortunate as it is, when people move from BSC to other chains, Pancakeswap will enter a bear trend and it will be hard to recover from that.

            "text": " \n\n[Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/activity/referral/offers/claim?ref=CPA_00EMS97UFF) is one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, boasting low fees, access to hundreds of cryptocurrencies, and advanced features for experienced investors. However, Binance is not available to U.S. customers -- if you live in the U.S., you'll need to use Binance.US, though it does have less functionality. Read our full Binance review to determine whether it's the right trading platform for you.\n\n**Full Binance review**\n\nThis cryptocurrency exchange is a good fit for: Advanced cryptocurrency traders around the world who want access to a broad range of currencies and features designed to maximize profits.\n\nPros\n\n* Low fees\n* Several ways to earn passive income\n* Wide range of cryptocurrencies\n* Advanced trading tools\n* Several ways to deposit money\n* Crypto-to-crypto or fiat-to-crypto trading\n\nCons\n\n* Not beginner friendly\n* Regulatory issues\n* Not available in the U.S.\n\nTop perks\n\nLow fees\n\n[Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/activity/referral/offers/claim?ref=CPA_00EMS97UFF) doesn't offer fee-free trading. However, its fees are low compared to even the best crypto exchanges that charge fees and commission. The highest spot trading fee is 0.1%.\n\nEarn passive income on crypto assets:\n\nBinance offers various ways to earn passive income, with varying degrees of risk. You can earn up to 30% APR on certain cryptos in its staking program, or put assets into a flexible savings account for lower but more consistent rates. More advanced investors might try to earn income via adding liquidity on pairs of tokens, but it's important to understand the risks involved before jumping in.\n\nLarge crypto selection:\n\nBinance is one of the largest cryptocurrency platforms in the world. It gives users access to over 370 currencies and thousands of trading pairs. This includes decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, stablecoins, Bitcoin (BTC), and altcoins.\n\nAdvanced trading tools:\n\nBinance makes it easy to set a limit order to buy or sell crypto at a specific price. It has a \"convert\" function for beginner users, and an advanced trading interface with charting tools for more experienced traders. Its Bitcoin futures section lets people speculate on whether the price of Bitcoin will rise or fall. It also sells leveraged tokens, which let customers multiply their positions in a particular currency. Trading with leverage is a risky strategy, because it can amplify losses and, in some cases, cause traders to lose their entire position.\n\n**What could be improved**\n\nNot available in the U.S.\n\nBinance has a separate platform in the U.S. with fewer features and cryptocurrencies. Binance.US trades over 60 cryptocurrencies, and does not offer futures trading or leveraged tokens. Binance.US accounts are not available in Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, New York, Texas, or Vermont.\n\nRegulatory attention:\n\n[Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/activity/referral/offers/claim?ref=CPA_00EMS97UFF) has found itself in regulators' crosshairs in a number of countries. These include Japan, the U.K., Canada, Singapore, and Thailand. And U.S. authorities are investigating potential money laundering, tax evasion, and insider trading. Binance denies any wrongdoing, and no charges have been filed.\n\nFor Binance customers, the regulatory spotlight could be unnerving, especially because it might make it hard to deposit or withdraw funds. Binance has taken steps to beef up its compliance team and keep regulators onside. The challenge is that the breadth of products that attract so many customers is also one of the things that's attracting regulatory attention. Binance will find it hard to square this circle.\n\nNot for beginners:\n\nBinance is a complex platform, designed to help experienced traders maximize profits. Its huge market selection and in-depth dashboards could be overwhelming and difficult to navigate if you're just getting started in crypto investing.\n\nThat said, Binance does have a simpler interface designed for first-timers, as well as a wealth of educational resources. It also asks users to complete a quiz that shows they understand specific dangers before accessing riskier products. However, if someone simply wants to buy Bitcoin for the first time, there are several more accessible platforms.\n\n**How Binance works**\n\nBinance is a fully functioning cryptocurrency exchange with a huge range of services. You can use Binance to:\n\n* Buy, sell, or trade cryptocurrency\n* Set up recurring buys\n* Earn passive income\n* Access advanced features such as crypto derivative products, limit orders, and peer-to-peer trading\n* Trade non-fungible tokens (NFTs)\n* Participate in Binance's Launchpad and Launchpool to get exposure to new cryptos\n* Access portfolio insights, plus live tracking and alerts\n* Keep track of your tax obligations with its tax reporting tool\n\nBe aware that Binance's broad range of products have gotten it into hot water with several regulatory bodies around the world. Binance does warn users of the risks involved. It also has an anti-addiction setting to temporarily suspend a person's account if they make a number of consecutive losing trades in a short time.\n\nBut ultimately, it gives retail investors access to risky products like margin trading. It is users' responsibility to manage the risk.\n\n**Trust Wallet**\n\n[Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/activity/referral/offers/claim?ref=CPA_00EMS97UFF) offers a custodial wallet on its platform. It does not have a built-in external crypto wallet. Instead, it recommends Trust Wallet, a hot (internet-connected) wallet that supports thousands of cryptocurrencies on most major blockchains. It is easy to withdraw assets from Binance to a Trust Wallet or other external crypto wallet.\n\nYou can use Binance via desktop, mobile, or its web-based app. It's a centralized exchange, so you need to provide some personal information to verify your account before you can get started.\n\n**Fees overview**\n\nBinance charges fees for trading, buying, and selling, as well as some withdrawals and deposits.\n\nDeposit and withdrawal fees:\n\nDeposit fees depend on the currency and method of payment. It's often free to make a bank transfer, but there's usually a fee for a debit card payment. In many countries, Binance allows credit or debit card payments, bank transfers, and peer-to-peer payments.\n\nYou can withdraw money to a bank account in a fiat currency, or withdraw crypto to a wallet or another exchange. Minimum withdrawal amounts and fees vary, based on your withdrawal method and currency.\n\nTrading fees:\n\nYour trading fee percentage depends on your trading volume in the past 30 days and the amount of BNB you hold. Maker orders -- those that add liquidity to the market -- also get lower fees than taker orders, which remove liquidity.\n\nAnyone can get a 25% discount on the trading fee by paying in the platform's native currency, Binance Coin (BNB).\n\n**Cryptocurrency selection**\n\n[Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/activity/referral/offers/claim?ref=CPA_00EMS97UFF) users can access more than 380 cryptocurrencies. Binance also has its own Binance Coin, and its own stablecoin, Binance USD (BUSD).\n\nYou'll find thousands of trading pairs on the site, including various fiat-to-crypto options. It has all the popular cryptocurrencies, including almost all the top 50 by market capitalization. These include Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA).\n\nBinance is quick to list new cryptocurrencies. It also offers customers early access to new projects through its Launchpool product. Newer cryptocurrencies do carry more risk, so investor caution is recommended.\n\n**Is your cryptocurrency safe with Binance?**\n\nSecurity is important when you're trusting your funds to a crypto exchange, especially given the number of hacks we've seen over the years.\n\nHere are some key security features on Binance:\n\n* It keeps the majority of funds offline in cold storage.\n* It stores 10% of trading fees in a secure fund meant to cover any losses from hacking. This is not the same as having third-party insurance, but does give users some protection.\n* User-level features such as two-factor authentication (2FA) and withdrawal address whitelisting. Whitelisting means you can restrict withdrawals to only pre-approved addresses.\n\n[Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/activity/referral/offers/claim?ref=CPA_00EMS97UFF) checks a lot of boxes in terms of the security features we look for, but its regulatory issues are not ideal. The company is working to change its reputation for acting first and seeking forgiveness later. It says its compliance team grew by 500% in 2021. But from a user perspective, if your country bans Binance, you might find yourself unable to access your funds. For example, Binance suspended GBP withdrawals and deposits for U.K. users for several months last summer following a regulatory crackdown.\n\n**Binance is right for you if:**\n\nYou have intermediate to advanced crypto trading experience.\n\n* You're looking for low fees, a wide range of currencies, and advanced features.\n* You're an institutional trader, or have high or ultra-high net worth.\n* You live outside the U.S.\n\n[**Click here to visit the official Binance website and learn more about what it has to offer!**](https://www.binance.com/en/activity/referral/offers/claim?ref=CPA_00EMS97UFF)\n\n ",

Similar to ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum (like ZIL, TRX etc which do not have a blockchain of their own right now), EOS also supports development and usage of other tokens. \nOne such major EOS-based token is EOS-DAC, and it has an airdrop based on an EOS snapshot scheduled for April-15th, 2018. Binance already announced that they will help swap the ERC-20 EOS tokens to EOS Mainnet tokens - which is great. Out request is that Binance also help with the airdrops, so that the EOS holders don't have to move their EOS tokens off the exchange.\n\nThanks, \nSundeep",

Then sell the btc in a year's time. Or is it locked in the assets that was borrowed? \n\nIs this flawed or is this the proper way to use leverage on binance? \n\n\nAsking for a friend lol.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\n\n \n \n\nAs per the comments below John is wrong.\n\nJohn should sell his 10 eth for USDT, then move $4000 USDT to his margin account.\n\nHere he borrows $8000 USDT for a total of 12000 USDT.\n\nWith that 12000 USDT he buys 30 ethereum and sits on it for a year.\n\nHe sells the 30 ethereum for 8k each (in his margin wallet), repays the 8000 USDT plus interest.\n\nJohn buys lambo",

            "text": "KEY CARDANO TAKEAWAYS\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA, now the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, maintains its top rankings as it sustains its uptrend three days in a row.\n\nThe ADA/USD exchange rate\u2019s uptrend comes as a breakout-move of its previous Descending Triangle range.\n\nThat raises the pair\u2019s potential to hit $1.50 in the coming sessions.\n\nEthereum\u2019s top rival Cardano is on a tear.\n\nThe blockchain platform\u2019s native asset, ADA,\u00a0surged\u00a0by up to 52 percent after bottoming out near $0.95 at the beginning of this week. As of Wednesday, the token has formed an intraday high of $1.45 before correcting mildly lower to the $1.35-1.44 range during the Asia-Pacific session Thursday\n\nTraders flocked into the Cardano market after Bitcoin started correcting lower upon establishing its record high above $61,000.\n\nADA offered an ideal refuge against the top cryptocurrency after its listing on Coinbase Pro, a US-based digital assets trading platform. More bullish tailwinds for ADA came from the ongoing craze surrounding non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Cardano allows users to create the said assets on its blockchain following its latest \u201cMary\u201d upgrade.\n\n$1.50\nTechnical indicators added to the bullish confluence. The ADA/USD exchange rate\u2019s latest move upside had it broke out of a Descending Triangle. Traders see the said structure as a bullish continuation pattern, primarily if the downside consolidation occurs after a strong move upward. ADA was trading higher before forming the Triangle.\n\nTypically, a breakout move emerging out of a falling triangle structure leads the asset higher by as much as the maximum distance between the structure\u2019s upper and lower trendline. In ADA\u2019s case, the length spans about $0.47. If one adds $0.47 to the level from where the token has broken the Triangle, then the breakout target comes near $1.50.\n\n\u201cIt is essential to note that the bullish outlook has been validated by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD),\u201d said analysts at CoinGape, a crypto-focused YouTube channel. \u201cThe trend momentum indicator has crossed into the positive region, suggesting that the least resistance path is upward.\u201d\n\nBesides, the\u00a0MACD\u00a0line leads the way above the signal line, which is another\u00a0bullish\u00a0signal,\u201d they added.\n\nRISKS\n\nOn the flip side, the ADA/USD\u2019s Relative Strength Indicator on the four-hour chart has entered the overbought territory. That increases the pair\u2019s likelihood of correcting lower to neutralize short-term buying sentiments. Should a correction appear, Cardano risks correcting to its flipped resistance area of $1.26-1.29.\n\n\nMeanwhile, fundamental risks also threaten to reverse ADA\u2019s bullish course. The Cardano token has rallied majorly because of its rival Ethereum\u2019s limitation as a blockchain project. The latter\u00a0suffers from higher gas and transaction fees issues\u00a0but remains committed to solve it by the end of this year through a long-awaited protocol upgrade from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.\n\nOne industry observer\u00a0commented\u00a0that he still has to see a single popular application operating atop the Cardano blockchain, unlike Ethereum, which boasts about projects like Tether and UniSwap. That makes ADA\u2019s latest gains more speculative, prone to wavering.",

I am currently one of the unfortunate people who has coins are stuck in what seems to be the equivalent of limbo in the crypto space.\n\n1.5 days ago while the market was dipping, in my extreme anxiousness I attempted to make a transfer of ETH from Binance to Gemini to manage all my ETH together in the same place. I admit with the lack of my better judgement I did not realize that I selected a network in which Gemini does NOT support or have access to.\n\nThe ETH were sent to the correct address but apparently the wrong network. I have been frantically trying to recover my coins, but was advised by both Gemini and Binance to look to the other party for assistance in this matter. I have tried everything I can to restore my ETH including sourcing the internet for help which lead to the discovery of horror of how many people falls into this gap.\n\nWhile the ETH I have might not look like a lot, but it truly is to me. Having loss employment during covid, this is just feels like another blow. I wanted to put some money into ETH in putting a little hope. I am feeling extremely hopeless and absolutely horrified at what little can be done in this situation. Coming to 48 hours, I'm still looking for a solution any way possible please.\n\nI feel very dishearten that neither platform is able or willing to retrieve the funds for me with out disclosing their private keys.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found another thread closest to this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/jf4t31/eth\\_burned\\_using\\_bep20\\_network/](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/jf4t31/eth_burned_using_bep20_network/)\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBinance:\n\n\"Base on the information provided, we can  see this transaction was already confirmed on the blockchain and it  should be credited to your account. Please contact the customer service  of the receiving platform if you still haven't receive your funds. If they can retrieve it, at least they can sent it back to Binance source address, then we can help to recover as deposit back to your  account.\"\n\n\"I wish I can help you with that, but we are unable to retrieve the funds as they have already left our platform.\"\n\n\"You can contact the receiving platform for help in this regard as they have your funds.\"\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGemini:\n\n\"Gemini supports Ethereum ERC-20 token standard. When you send ETH or ETH tokens over Binance Smart Chain you are sending a Binance BEP-20 token which Gemini does not support, and we have no way of recovering these funds at this time.\"\n\n\"Gemini will most likely never support BSC network, we can only recover ERC-20 tokens and not binance pegged tokens.\"\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLESSON LEARNT:\n\nCrypto transfers have one huge design flaw- no fail safe!\n\nDo NOT ever use BEP2 or any Binance smart chain  when withdrawing to an exchange. Few exchanges besides Binance support it.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nADVICE RECIEVED:\n\nI encourage your to always send a test transaction if you are not sure what network you are sending tokens. Also if you are going to send any ETH to an exchange like Gemini, Coinbase, Kraken etc it is best to send over the Ethereum network as this will happen again since none of the exchanges I mentioned support Binance chain.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPLEASE share if you have faced a similar situation. Or please share if you have found any solutions to this so that others might also find answers.",

If you install Trust Wallet app and import the wallet address your tokens went to (you can find that address in the history of your own wallet you send it from on BSCscan.com). Add the Binance-peg Ethereum Token and you'll see your funds. But it is 'watch-only' Trust wallet so you won't be able to do anything with the funds apart from seeing them. Hopefully, this will give you some sort of comfort that your funds are not in a stranger's wallet. It is still with Gemini so if they start supporting BEP20, your funds will appear in your Gemini account. The catch is, as you  pointed out, not even people at Gemini know if their system will ever support BEP20. I  keep looking for a solution but this is the closest I got to my lost Ethereum.",

Still radio-silence.   \nLaw Enforcement agency states limited accessibility to information and difficulties with case investigation as the company Binance is not registered in-country.   \nBinance, a billion-dollar reputable company, doesn't take responsibility for security gaps, doesn't combat fraud and foremost disappointingly doesn't communicate with customers on their wrong-doing.   \nInstead Binance is ducking away. Big disappointment!   \nWhat else can be done?",

Unfortunately, they are unwilling to help me recover the ONE tokens, citing reasons like \"due to the nature of the blockchain\" -- when clearly they are different blockchains as everyone knows, and the point is to help recover my ONE tokens using the private key that they hold.\n\nI understand the process may be complicated as it can only be done by authorized staff under strict audit, but I am willing to wait and pay any administrative fees related to the retrieval but unfortunately they do not seem very enthusiastic with helping.\n\nAlready commented on weekly thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/myrjp3/weekly\\_binance\\_support\\_thread/gwijcv2](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/myrjp3/weekly_binance_support_thread/gwijcv2)\n\nThank you for reading and would really appreciate an upvote to get more visibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Support ticket number #71144165",

            "text": "Hi all, I've been studying the cryptocurrency field for a long time, and I keep finding a lot of interesting things in all the products on the market. Many people ask me where I keep my crypto assets. And today I'm going to describe the main crypto wallets and name all their pros and cons. First of all, let's see how it works in as simple terms as possible. \n\n# How do crypto wallets work? \n\nA cryptocurrency wallet stores your public and private keys. When it comes to sending and receiving cryptocurrency, those keys are all you need. \n\n* Your **public key** is what you share with your sender/receiver. You can share this key with any number of people. \n* Your **private key** is the key you keep for yourself. It is linked to your public key through cryptography and acts as a digital signature for the transaction.\n\nIn fact, there's a lot more to say about this, but I'll skip the lyricism and get to the point. So where to store cryptocurrency? Storing cryptocurrency assets is the most important part of working with crypto. So, the choice of storage should be approached very responsibly. As the most popular options, there are three subcategories: \n\n* Software crypto wallets\n* Hardware crypto wallets\n* Exchanges crypto wallets\n\nToday, I\u2019ll do a whole-feature comparison and figure out which ones will be best suited to the specific tasks of each kind of user.  \n\n# Software Wallets\n\nThis subcategory includes desktop, mobile, and web wallets. Software wallets can be mobile or computerized, which are downloaded directly to the device. I would say these are the most convenient options for storage, and in the case of non-custodial ones, also the safest ones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ncels9f670b71.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e056db89a0171e27ec24665a3fdc93d25bf25df\n\n# Blockchain Wallet\n\n[Blockchain Wallet](https://www.blockchain.com/wallet?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=binance-bw) is by far the most popular digital wallet that allows users to store and manage their cryptocurrencies to the fullest extent. Blockchain Wallet is maintained by Blockchain, a software company. \n\n **Pros:** \n\n* Mobile app, with a well-optimised UI/IX;\n* Web Interface Support;\n* Support for leading cryptocurrencies; \n* Open source code in free access.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n* In case, if fraudsters manage to get access to the user's mail, they can easily withdraw all the money stored in the wallet;\n* No desktop version of the wallet;\n* Storage of keys on the developer's side.\n\n**Summary:** Despite the fact that it is one of the most popular wallets, I would not highly recommend it. If you want to try yourself in the world of cryptocurrency and send a small amount there, this option can still be considered. However, when dealing with large amounts, and the frequency of blokchain.com hacks, I would put it in the last place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Coinbase Wallet\n\n[This wallet](https://wallet.coinbase.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=binance-bw) combines the versatility offered by its predecessor Toshi Wallet with the support offered by Coinbase. In this wallet, you can store your ethers and tokens based on the Ethereum network, as well as interact with dApps from a single app.\n\n**Pros:** \n\n* Support for a mobile app, with a superior UI/IX;\n* Support for web interface;\n* Support for leading cryptocurrencies; \n\n**Cons:** \n\n* Storage of keys on the developer side.\n* No desktop version of the wallet;\n* Lack of open source code in free access.\n\n**Summary:** \n\n[Coinbase Wallet](https://wallet.coinbase.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=binance-bw) is a great alternative for storing your tokens and managing your dApps. First of all, it generates a seed to backup your funds. Secondly, it's a very simple app, easy to use and equipped with lots of tools. \n\nOn the other hand, the app can cause some inconvenience. When opening dApp, the browser may freeze and you have to tap to close the app and reopen it to make it work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Trust Wallet\n\n[Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=https://wallet.coinbase.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=binance-bw-bw) is a mobile wallet app launched in November 2017 that allows you to store your digital assets. It guarantees anonymous and secure transactions on your devices\n\n**Pros:** \n\n* Private keys are stored on the user's device;\n* Ability to work with decentralized applications (dApp);\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Lack of support for many tokens; \n* Does not provide two-factor authentication; \n* Not user-centric interface design.\n\n**Summary:** \n\nIn my opinion, Trust Wallet is not recommended for use because this platform is still young and its service offering remains limited. Although Trust Wallet is already well known in the cryptocurrency market, it is far from the best option for receiving, storing or exchanging cryptocurrencies and many other tokens.\n\nTrust Wallet is great for users who are not too picky about functionality and do not have the need to keep a large portfolio of different tokens. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Guarda Wallet\n\n[Guarda Wallet](https://guarda.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=https://wallet.coinbase.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=binance-bw-bw) is a crypto project that supports 50+ coins, 10K+ tokens and 13 coins for staking. Moreover, it is one of the few companies that support all kinds of clients, from mobile application to a web version. What's more, they don't store your keys on their servers, which literally reduces the potential chance of wallet hacking to zero. \n\n**Pros:** \n\n* Allows any ERC20 token to be stored; (10k+ tokens)\n* Mobile app support\n* Support for the web interface \n* Desktop support \n* Private Keys are stored on the user\u2019s device \n* Web3 Support \n* Wallet Connect support\n* 50+ coins are available on Guarda.\n* Your own token generator.\n\n**Cons:** \n\n* No 2FA Support *(Theoretically, it is there, for example, you can store a backup in the cloud where there is 2FA. But given that Guarda is non-custodial - it is not so useful)*\n* In order to update the balance, you need to swipe up the app.\n\n**Summary:** In my humble opinion, Guarda is one of the best products on the market. They are constantly working on their product, adding new features and implementing constant updates. Moreover, they support a lot of tokens, allow you to buy coins, and elaborate all their instructions so that even a very new user can understand them. \n\nThere are some minor inconveniences, though. For example, in order to see the updated balance, you need to refresh the application. However, this is probably not so much a bug as a feature, so that users can be sure how much money they have on their balance before sending it. I can safely say that Guarda is my favorite when it comes to choosing a cryptocurrency wallet. Yes, there are nuances, but they are actually overshadowed by the positives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Atomic Wallet\n\n[Atomic Wallet](https://atomicwallet.io/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=https://wallet.coinbase.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=binance-bw-bw), created by Konstantin Gladich, is a decentralized and multicurrency cryptocurrency wallet that allows you to store or exchange digital currencies. It is the very first atomic swap wallet. Many people wonder if this wallet is reliable or not. Some hold it in high regard, while others consider it a less effective online portfolio. It seems to me that it is the needs of the consumer that come into play here. It is clearly not suitable for beginners, but for mature users, it is quite possible to consider it.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Mobile App Support\n* Desktop Support\n* Multicurrency \n* Multi-signature \n* Open Source\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* No web-interface support\n* Not user-friendly UI/IX \n* Integrated DEX lags\n\n**Summary:** \n\nI couldn't find any relevant information about the security and transparency of this cryptocurrency wallet. Seriously, there is a lack of serious regulation of this platform. It is possible that they are hiding their weak security potential. Atomic Wallet is not yet optimized for all platforms. In addition, there is some opacity about how it collects transaction fees.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Exodus Wallet\n\n[Exodus wallet](https://www.exodus.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=https://wallet.coinbase.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=binance-bw-bw) is a software wallet launched in 2015 by Daniel Castagnoli and J.P. Richardson in Nebraska, where it is headquartered. The project was also funded by several Swiss foundations and is one of the most popular wallets and powerful as several specialized pages. Exodus is present in many countries around the world largely due to its simple mobile app with an intuitive design and fairly simple language, making it a very practical tool for those new to the world of cryptocurrency.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Very useful for regular cryptocurrency traders\n* Lots of guides and videos to learn about the wallet\n* Specially designed for beginners\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Slightly weak security (no 2FA)\n* No multi-signature support\n* Not open source\n\n**Summary:** \n\nExodus is ideal for beginners with cryptocurrencies. Many regulars also continue to use Exodus, so practical and pleasant it\u2019s for use. However, its security remains quite low, so I would recommend investing only reasonable amounts in it\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Coinami\n\nNegative comments appear from time to time on various web portals or forums. Nevertheless, [Coinomi](https://www.coinomi.com/en/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=https://wallet.coinbase.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=binance-bw-bw) is one of the safest software wallets on the entire market, and this is reflected in the fact that, so far, none of the user accounts created with this wallet has been stolen or hacked. What is really striking is that while this wallet has an extremely high level of security to prevent hacking or theft of funds, it does not have the security of a pin code or the typical two-step authentication process that is recommended for most cryptocurrency accounts today.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Handling a variety of crypto. \n* Easy to set up. \n* High privacy level. \n\n**Cons:**\n\n* You cannot buy cryptocurrency with fiat money in the app.\n* Coinomi is currently only available for Android phones.\n* Only parts of the Coinomi source code are available, there are others that are private.\n\n**Summary:** \n\nThis wallet is available in the vast majority of countries because the presence of the IP anonymization feature adds a new level of security, especially useful for those who receive money in countries that are considered insecure.\n\nOverall, user opinion of Coinomi is very positive and most emphasize the ease of use. However, things like the lack of ability to buy currency or the Android-only app spoil the picture quite a bit. Therefore it is necessary to make a conscious choice and understand that if there is a possibility to use a more functional wallet, it is better to choose it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# My TOP of software crypto wallets\n\nSo, every wallet is good and bad in its own way. I've deduced quite a few pros and cons about each, and the truth is, there is no wallet that has everything perfect. In this area, wallets still have some work to do. However, considering that I am interested in crypto staking, I steel had to choose the best variant. \n\n[Guarda](https://guarda.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=https://wallet.coinbase.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=binance-bw-bw) seems to be #1 option for me in all aspects. Not only because it supports so many tokens, but also it allows me to get an additional income. \n\nHowever, apart from Guarda, I often use [Trust](https://trustwallet.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=binance-bw), because I really like its interface. It is quite simple. For somebody, it may be a disadvantage, but I like it when it is easy to use the wallet without understanding the details of its interface. \n\nThen I put [Atomic](https://atomicwallet.io/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=https://wallet.coinbase.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=binance-bw-bw) to third place. Despite the fact that there are many questions about it, it still wins over CoinBase and Blockchain in terms of everything. Why? - You ask. There are a lot of cases how these two wallets were hacked.",

But let's make a fun thought experiment and try to imagine the domino effect as far as possible, what would happen  if USDT  loses it's peg or even becomes clear that is worth nothing or close to nothing at 15th Jan, when is the deadline for iFinex (the parent company of Tether and Bitfinex) to submit the requested documentation to NYAG (New Your Attorney General) that US authorities requested in the middle of 2019 and iFinex has been using all possible ways to delay that until now. Few fun facts to get your thinking started with:\n\n\\- They've been delaying providing those docs for 1.5 years, given that track record I find it unlikely they will provide them now, or that they will be up to satisfaction.\n\n\\- They've been ramping USDT printing exponentially in the last 6 months, $1B tether printed just the first few days of this year. For an outsider it looks like they know shit is about to hit the fan and want to buy as much unseizable crypto assets as possible before the end.\n\n\\- Market cap when they admitted they have only 76% backing in 2018 was $2B, it's $22B now \n\n\\- USDT is by far having the biggest trading volume against any crypto\n\n\\- Their last \"audit\" was in 2018 and it looked like a joke, they actually never provided proper audit of their reserves, never.\n\n\\- They always mint tether in big round number, like $800M just the other day. I find it hard to believe that deposits of investors always add-up to a round number. Look USDC mints for example, they are always like 23939394\n\n\\- Nobody seems to know where they bank right now? (Correct me if you know)\n\n\\- USDT is in lots of AMM DEX pools with other stables, if USDT loses it's peg and goes to $0, the other stable in that pool will lose it's peg to by going much above $1, so that even can single handedly cause all stables to lose their pegs\n\n\\- That will cause a lot of people that have borrowed other stables against crypto to be undercollaterized, which will liquadate their crypto collateral at market price, causing the price of that crypto to tank, cause other people to be under-collaterized and so on.....the domino is quite obvious here.\n\n\\- There is a lot of BTC on Ethereum in various forms, some of them based on collateral, that collateral might depreciate way too fast, what would happen to the BTC on ethereum?\n\n\\- nobody seems to have used [tether.to](https://tether.to) to  redeem USDT for USD?\n\n\\- a lot of exchanges rely heavily on USDT \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne train of thought seems to be everyone will pour their depreciating USDT in crypto causing the prices to go even higher, but who will take it? Well AMM LP will be the first to suffer I suppose but what happens on  CEXes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe opposite and much harder to forsee domino effect will be the doomsday scenario, all stables losing their peg, mass liquadations, halted trading at CEXes and so on, but how far could that potentially reach effect wise? How long it can last?   \nPlease try to forsee the domino effect as far as possible as a fun thought experiment.\n\nHopefully nothing will happen at 15th or at least the US government won't react harshly knowing what that would cause, but still would be better to be prepared for all possible scenarios and excersize our thinking in the process.",

As the largest crypto exchange by volume in the world, Binance is often people's first choice for an exchange to actively trade on without the danger of crashing due to order volume (such as when American XRP holders crashed Uphold in late January).\n\nWhat are some long term holds that ya'll currently have in your bag? Mine are the following:  \n\n\n(1) **Zenon (ZNN)** \\- not available on Binance  \n(2) **Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR)** \\- available on Binance  \n(3) **Pylon Finance (PYLON)** \\- not available on Binance  \n(4) **Flare (FLR)** \\- will be available on Binance (I'll be getting 30k from the airdrop)  \n\n\nI know it might be risky to list a currency like Zenon as one of my biggest holds due to it's age compared with it's lack of having an exchange, but after reading the whitepaper, checking out the community, and looking at the roadmap, I was really impressed. It could easily be a competitor with Ethereum in the future due to the cryptographic language they've developed for zApps.   \n\n\nI also chose Flare because it will serve as the collateral token for decentralized XRP transactions. Whereas RippleNet will be for institutions, Flare Network could be the adoptive strategy for crypto mass adoption in East Asia.  \n\n\nAnyway, what's in your bag? Any other Zenon holders, and if so, why are you accumulating?",

Anyway it looks like everything is just adwares and unwanted programs so I really don't know what could be the problem.\n\nUPDATE 2: I am trying to contact all the addresses that have sent ether to the same hacker address on etherscan. Anyway if someone which has suffered the same ends up here feel free to contact me here or with a DM.

As a reminder, this is a simple guide for newbies that want to get a quick piece of the action. There are many other ways, and this is one that worked for me.\n\n1) Click this link and watch a 3 min video on how to create a coin base account. The video is not mine, but Nathan Scaglione did a great job.\nhttps://youtu.be/LvFcwYX4moU\n\n2) Open an account at https://www.coinbase.com/\n\n3) Buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin (my favorite)\n\n4) Open a Binance account at https://www.binance.com/?ref=10987182\nP.S. This is my ref link above click if you want to help me out, if not click one below.\n\n5) Send your coin of choice from Coinbase, which you bought in step 3 to Binance. A) Log onto www.Binance.com, clink the funds tab at the top of Binance webpage and select withdraw deposit. B) Find Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin (whatever you bought) and click on deposit. C) Click on QR code and a QR picture will pop up. D) Open the Coinbase app available on Apple and Google store. E) Sign in and click accounts bottom middle of app, click the coin you bought, and click on the white arrow in the upper right of the app. F) Type in amount of coin you would like to send I.E .01 BTC, click send G) Click QR picture in top right and scan QR code from www.Binance.com and click send.\n\n6) Now that might seem like a lot but it is really easy after you complete your first transfer. Click the funds tab again and go to history. After about a minute (longer if you used bitcoin) you will see your transfer coming in. After the transfer gets 6/6 confirmation you will have your coin in your account.\n\n7) If you bought bitcoin you are good to go! just selected exchange tab then click on basic, type XRP in the search bar on the right side of the webpage. It will pop up, click it, find the big green buy xrp and place your order.\n\n8) If you bought Litecoin from coin base it the same but you need to sale your Litecoin for Bitcoin first.\nWell, thats it! Again there are many other ways to buy XRP, and other Alt coins but this way worked for me. Binance has very low transaction fee's, simple to use, and has a ton of alt coins to choose from, and can be set up with Google authenticator for added security. Thanks, all hope this helped.",

You will need to write a simple proxy script to route requests based on \"BlockTag\" if you want it to act like a node that has all blocks available. I designed it this way so you can run part of the chain with more nodes than another part (ie: demand scaling) as well as making it cheaper to run if you are just parsing the chain and populating a database (since you don't need to everything at once, you can run just parts of the chain to save a lot of money).",

Is there any CEX that does?\n\nThe reason I ask is because I need to get a small amount, less than $30 probably, of $ETH onto Optimism, just to cover staking fees on Synthetix, and the fee to do this on the Optimism Gateway is like $40, thus pretty much defeating the whole purpose of Optimism.\n\nI started staking on Synthetix way back when gas prices were still pennies, and like everyone else I abandoned the Ethereum network for Binance when the gas fees forced out everyone but the whales. But of course my stake on Synthetix was trapped behind the Gwei Paywall. I had hopes that Optimism would make it viable again, but that only works if I can somehow fund my Optimism wallet.\n\nIs there maybe a more roundabout way of circumventing Gwei fees, using another second-layer like Polygon, for example, like a Polygon to Optimism gateway?\n\nOr should I write off my pitiful Synthetix stake as a lost cause, permanently trapped behind a Gwei Paywall?",

At the most basic level, the blockchain is a chain of digital information blocks in which information (\u201cblock\u201d) is stored in a public database (\u201cchain\u201d).\n\n# Story\n\nSince the rise of personal computers and then the Internet, innovative resources have been developing steadily. One day, when it combined correctly, all these techs have led to the creation of a revolutionary technology such as blockchain:\n\nDuring the 90s, various works on decentralized solutions for electronic payments appeared. As a result, the technology allowed transferring funds without the need to be dependent on any central supervisory or regulatory body. In 1991, the first work on secure blockchain appeared. The mechanisms described there were developing until Wei Dai described a decentralized solution for electronic payments based on public-key cryptography in 1998.\n\nMeanwhile, someone under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto publishes...

About an hour and 45 minutes ago, I've used the Binance Bridge to send my ETH from Metamask Ethereum Mainnet to Binance Smart Chain Network (BNB). I've filled everything in as supposed, plus I've checked the receiving address 3 times to make sure it was mine (Binance Bridge filled in the address itself once I connected my Metamask wallet, so I've just checked it). A few minutes later it said that the transaction was successful, but no BNB arrived in my Metamask BSC Network Wallet. I've then checked the history in Binance Bridge, there was no record of such transaction. Then I've checked my Metamask transaction history, it was there, but for some reason the receiving address was a completely different address than the one I've filled in while submitting the order??? Is this some kind of a scam? Please help, 200 EUR is really A LOT to me. Thanks in advance.\n\nP.S. the \"new\" receiving address is this one: 0xC8FCC4331a2B93479cacEb62726c98A34c60576d . I've checked it out on etherscan and the transaction really did arrive on there.",

You buy an item and expect it to be worth more in the future, but it lacks the interactivity between the player and the game.\n\n2021 can be said to be a \"Welcome to the World of Play To Earn\" year because it has opened up a wave of NFT gaming trends with a lot of positive information surrounding it also created many record numbers in the crypto market.\n\nLeading the way for deeper game interaction is the Axies project and following many other NFT projects participating in the \"play2earn\" game that has brought the entire Ethereum network to life. Since then, many new projects have begun to expand across other Chains to optimise costs and bring more interesting experiences.\n\n# What Is Play2Earn?\n\n## Concept\n\nPlay-To-Earn is a combination of two actions Play & Earn, which means both playing games and earning money. Gaming has been around since the 1970s, each phase has a face of innovation & in 2021, a unique combination of NFT and traditional gaming takes place, giving users (both crypto & non-crypto) a unique experience. new play to earn experience.\n\nPlay to Earn has been around for a long time, for many 8x, 9x generation gamers, the game Silk Road is a good example, you can transform into simulation characters, fight & raise account rank, buy and sell weapons, participate in hunting prizes, etc. If you can \"plow\" to become a terrible level, many powerful weapons can be sold to make money.\n\n## What Is Different About Play2Earn In Crypto 2021?\n\nThanks to blockchain technology and the advantages of the Crypto market, the Play to Earn model has now been improved, specifically:\n\n* Gaming operators have incorporated NFT in their protocol.\n* Improve ownership of in-game assets for users.\n* Players are creating value for other players and developers, in return they are rewarded with in-game assets (native tokens/NFTs).\n\n# Booming\n\nNFT and Play to Earn are very hot topics in recent times and that is also one of the reasons why transactions on the Ethereum network have become active again.\n\n \n\nWith a play-to-earn model, Axie Infinity is a name that brings a new wave with successful development in the past time. This is a Crypto project conceived by Vietnamese team & launched in 2018. Axie Infinity is built on Loom Network - a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Inspired by the popular game series Pok\u00e9mon and CryptoKitties, players in Axie also need to do quests, battle, and exchange items with other users at the Marketplace.\n\nEach Axie in the game can be purchased and owned as NFT (Non-fungible token), the player needs to raise them with $SLP (Small love potions). NFT & $SLP items are all exchangeable to $AXS and trade them for profit.\n\nGame Axie Infinity is played not only for fun but also for money, these criteria have affected the majority of Filipinos. In particular, during the Covid 19 epidemic season, Axie's hotness spread even more. From the elderly to young children, everyone downloads & plays games to earn money, which has helped Filipinos have a great source of income in the most difficult time.\n\nAXS is a utility token representing Axie Infinity that serves as an in-game reward & exchange item.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n**TLDR**:\n\nWe can see that the Play-To-Earn trend is growing strongly, especially in the current market situation, both owning NFT (True Ownership) characters and valuable token rewards. , but can that happen in the long-term when the cash flow has already begun to \"stagnate\".\n\nWith the blockchain being widely recognised, it is possible that many large funds will start to participate in this game, the money may flow in the future & NFT Gaming projects are one of the most popular categories. The attraction and potential of Play To Earn projects are feasible, but not in the short term and depends on each project.",

            "text": "Hello,\n\nBefore I ask this question, I'm well aware now that you should never sign up for a token airdrop with an exchange ETH address and to always make sure the address you use is ERC-20 compatible. However, I made this mistake a few months back when I first started signing up for airdrops and entered my Binance ETH address in the \"Ethereum Wallet Address\" field during many of my first airdrop request forms. A few weeks later I realized the mistake I made and made a MyEtherWallet account for this specific purpose for future token airdrops. I didn't really think much of the original airdrops I signed up for with my Binance ETH address until today.  Out of curiosity, I decided to look up my Binance ETH address on Etherscan. I was surprised to see that the wallet address was in fact showing several tokens credited to it, with the total value of them exceeding $150.\n\nSo now I have 2 questions. First off, Is there any way to get Binance to authorize an unlisted Token transaction out of a customer's ETH address and into another ERC-20 compatible wallet? \n\nAnd second, if one of the airdropped coins that's currently credited within my ETH wallet on Binance were to get listed for trading on Binance, would it automatically credit my account with the coins already in my ETH Wallet? \n\nI'm not stressing over the potentially lost tokens since I know it was my mistake in the first place, but I figured it couldn't hurt to explore my options.",

I cannot complain much, since there is a large ROI (although a very small allocation), but still... a lot of things dont match, and I would like to share some thoughts with this community.\n\nThe main problem is that the token unlocking schedule is not evenly met to everyone, the unlocking time rules are not fully open or are not accomplished, and some folks are able to sell their tokens at very high prices much before my tokens even arrive at my wallet. Let\u00b4s see what happened in the Lazio token launch example.\n\n\\*\\*Lazio token launch\\*\\*\n\n\\*Rules\\*\n\nAccording with Binance schedule, all BNB commitments ended on 21st October at 10:00 AM (UTC). All Lazio tokens were supposed to be unlocked at 11:00 AM (UTC) of the same day.\n\n\\*Problems\\*\n\n1. Something that is not said in the launchpad rules, but that experienced users know (I had forgotten) is that trading only opens one hour after unlocking time. The fact that trading opens one hour late is not a problem. It could be even a good thing if this time was clearly written in the schedule and it was used by Binance to guarantee that all buyers get their tokens before the trade opens. However, neither is true.\n2. I only received my tokens at 12:21 PM, 21 minutes after the trading started, by this time the token price had already fallen from $100 to $21.\n\n\\*Does it worth?\\*\n\nOk, I had only paid $1 for each token, so I got a 20x return in a couple of hours. However, my allocation size was only of $1.6, so I got only $35. Looks like free money, right? Not quite. My BNB commitment was equivalent to $1,500. I had to leave this money parked at my spot wallet for a week to have the subscription right. This makes a 2% return in a week. Looks a lot for traditional finance, but in this same week, BTC went up 10% and Ethereum and Solana went up 20%.\n\nIn addition, I had to wake up at 6:00 am (of my country time) to make the subscription and I was stuck at home for 3.3 hours before my tokens were unlocked. Arrive kind of late in my job, and 3 hours of my work definitely worth more than $35.\n\nLastly, despite the small profit, there is the feeling that the rules are not the same for everyone, that some insiders get their tokens early. That is the worst part of it, to feel that you take part of something unfair. So no, it did not worth for me.",

            "text": "I dealt with someone on Binance P2P. Everything went smoothly. A couple of days later, I got a message from my payments company that the woman has opened a dispute with her bank and restrictions have been put on my account. After VERY, VERY LONG conversations with the person I dealt with, I found out that she wasn't a British woman but in fact, *he* was a Nigerian man who had stolen the identity of a British woman and made a Binance account in her name and a bank account in her name. After A LOT OF hassle, I was able to get the restrictions on my account removed and got the money returned to the British woman. Very soon after I got the message from my payments company, I got the counterparty's Binance account permanently frozen and made sure that they told me that it was *permananently* frozen. Binance told me that they needed proof that I returned the money to the British woman's account. I provided them the proof. Binance still said that I need to sort things out with the counterparty before they could send the cryptocurrency I had transferred to the counterparty as part of the deal. The next time I contacted them, Binance had unfrozen the counterparty's account and the Nigerian scammer had withdrawn all his cryptocurrency (well, he left $2 out of $7200, so can't really say all). Not even once had I allowed Binance to unfreeze his account. I was very clearly assured by Binance that his account was *permanently* frozen. I had even provided them proof that I returned the money back to the British woman. And Binance let the scammer run away with my cryptocurrency. After repeatedly contacting them, they basically said there's nothing they can do about this now. Is there anything I can do? Shouldn't Binance refund my cryptocurrency back to me because it is *completely* Binance's fault?",

            "text": "**About your author: CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from our weekly** [**Moonshot Monday**](https://cryptoquestion.tech/weekly-podcast/) **podcast to our weekly Staking and Farming Review. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)\n\nWe are all suckers for a good story.\n\nThe best stories are the ones that provide you with a lightbulb moment. I much prefer stories about how a business idea is going to solve a particular problem and leave me multiple times richer than the story from a girlfriend about her day at the office and how her training is going for her upcoming marathon. The latter is guaranteed to put me to sleep, the former will light a fire inside of me.\n\nAnd so it was with Candela Coin.\n\nLike many of us hunting for the next big thing in cryptocurrency we uncovered Candela Coin after reading a short post on a Reddit forum. It is the small hidden posts that usually reap the most lucrative rewards. This post wasn\u2019t your normal spam you find on most Reddit crypto forums. It was more thought out and immediately captured our imagination.\n\n\u2018A project which aims to cut out the big electricity corporations by allowing end users to share solar power generated from their own panels via micro grids. All powered by the Candela Coin. All this for a valuation of $100,000. The founder was also doxxed, always a good sign. Compared to its nearest competitor, Power Ledger with a market cap at the time of $100 million, Candela was looking like a diamond in the rough!\u2019\n\nWhilst we liked the look of Candela we realized execution was key to its success. It wouldn\u2019t be cheap to roll this concept out to the masses. When we quizzed Candela\u2019s founder Avi he told us he was independently wealthy from a previous venture and was able to finance this project from his own resources. Red flag #1.\n\nIn the space of a few months the price of CLA climbed steadily as more people discovered this project and bought into its story.\n\nCLA was originally an ERC-20 token which as we all know is expensive to buy with extortionate gas fees. In order to overcome this objection Avi set up the same coin on BSC. One token was supposed to be a store of value and the other a utility token. Which one was which was never totally clear. It was always assumed that the proceeds from the sale of these new BSC tokens would go towards the project but no one asked the question and Avi didn\u2019t dwell on the subject. Red flag #2.\n\nWhen the NFT craze started Avi decided that he would launch a range of NFTs. That was quickly followed by his announcement that Candela would be entering the metaverse. What the hell these two initiatives had to do with Candela\u2019s core business is anyone\u2019s guess. Laser focus is essential to the success of any startup. Red flag #3.\n\nWhilst all these developments were going on a few disgruntled CLA investors started to share private messages they had received from Avi and his merry band of angry helpers. It became very clear that Avi and co were in the habit of threatening and abusing anyone who questioned his decision making and the legitimacy of his project. Derogatory comments about investor\u2019s mothers were just the tip of the iceberg. Red flag #4.\n\nFrom these private messages it also became clear that Avi was holding tokens on behalf of investors and refusing to hand them back. A red flag right there. Red flag #5.\n\nIn order to attract bigger investments Avi launched a whale group. To qualify investors had to invest a minimum of one million tokens. In exchange for this investors would receive additional benefits including a Candela branded solar panel that it was developing, according to Avi anyway. Despite multiple promises these panels never arrived. Red flag #6.\n\nThere were multiple other red flags. Like the time when Avi announced that Candela was going to list on the Canadian Stock Exchange. He then qualified this by saying that he would need to raise money through a share issue first. The big venture capital firms he told us he had closed never materialized and the $100,000 he raised no doubt went straight into his well oiled pocket.\n\nHis final lie was his promise of a listing of CLA on a large central exchange. That announcement was made on Friday and the listing was scheduled for the following Monday.\n\nIt was a cold grey day when I awoke on Monday at 5am. The first message I opened was from a community member who was asking why the CLA Telegram channel had restricted chat and their Twitter account was closed. Avi had also changed his Telegram name to \u2018ABC\u2019.\n\nWithin a few hours everyone was screaming rug pull!\n\nAvi had gone to ground. Some speculated that he had run off to his newly built Mexican mansion with his ill gotten gains.\n\nWithin 24 hours Avi re-emerged. It was a hack he insisted. Why would he throw all his hard work away for a few dollars he complained. The listing was on schedule for next Monday he promised. Oh and for good measure, I was a total loser for doubting him.\n\nThen he disappeared again and hasn\u2019t been heard from since. Rug pull complete.\n\nNo doubt Avi walked away with a couple of million dollars from his scam. He is probably trying to enjoy his Christmas surrounded by Mexican hookers, cheap cocaine and Tequila with the sole purpose of taking his mind off the chaos he left behind. He is no doubt under the illusion that he got away with it. But he forgot one thing. He stole from Americans. The Feds have a low tolerance for such shenanigans. His time will come. Hiding in Mexico didn\u2019t help El Chapo, it won\u2019t help Avi Shane Verdugo...\n\nAccording to a recent report, 73% of projects listed on PancakeSwap will turn out to be scams. What this sad story demonstrates is there are an abundance of believable and compelling stories circulating the cryptocurrency ecosystem. A minority will be real and from those real ones only a fraction will succeed. That is why it is important that when investing in this market you must take profits. Don\u2019t HODL, like Avi and his merry band of supporters urged investors. When you hear the word \u2018HODL\u2019 remember, that is red flag #7.

According to a new Forbes story, the cryptocurrency exchange has formed a joint partnership with Gulf Energy Development. Businessman Sarath Ratanavadi actually owns Gulf Energy Development.\n\n\nBinance wants to extend its services into Thailand. An agreement with Sarath Ratanavadi's Gulf Energy Development will help the exchange receive a license from Thai regulators. On the other contrary, this cooperation was first revealed in February by Reuters, citing words from a top executive.\n\nAccording to the senior executive, the relationship will be publicly announced in the second half of 2022. Forbes has verified the collaboration as Q2 begins.\n\nFurthermore, according to Forbes, Gulf Energy Development plans to invest in BNB, which is also known as the Binance Coin. They will also invest in part of the shares of Binance, the US branch of the cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\n \nAccording to Brian Shroder, the current CEO of the exchanges, the US is aiming for an IPO.\n\n \nGulf Energy filed an official statement with the Thai Stock Exchange on Monday, wherein the company stated:\n\n \n\n\"The company, Gulf Energy believes that this multi-level collaboration with Binance, the world leader in blockchain service platform, is in line with the company's goal of becoming the pioneer in the field infrastructure. Will also offer prospects for the firm to widen into other digital asset-based initiatives in the long term.\"\n\n \n\nFurthermore, it's worth noting that Binance received many warnings in 2021 from the Thai administration. Thai governments declared that the company had no authority to trade in the country without a license. On the alternative side, Thailand has outlawed the use of cryptocurrency for payments and the trade of Non Fungible Tokens and meme currencies. \n\n\nFurthermore, companies like deedy, and other digital transformation oriented projects are also working strategically at the moment to overcome similar hurdles which can result in a positive manner for the company.",

This money you win by staking does not come from thin air. \n\nIt's usually distributed by the DEX that offer you to stake.\nAt the basics, staking is a way to secure the asset, so you are rewarded for not selling, basically (a bit more complex than that, but you got the gist of it)\n\nHigh return pools is appealing, but there are also risks involved. Because usually this kind of Apr/apy is on very volatile assets, and you may want to search why it's sitting a 1000%+.\n\nBe aware that, staking on a CEX and on a DEX can be different. Each plateform has its set of rules, and apply them how they want. Some staking are locked, other are not, unstaking can come with a penalty, or takes time (you want to know how long it take to unstake, especially in a possible bear market).\n\nYou have a great website that can display to you most of the things that are used today.\n\nApe board.\nhttps://apeboard.finance/\n\nDisplaying for eth, BSC, Avax, ftm, terra, egld, sol, polygon, cosmos, cro, one..\n\nYou can also track your LP if you have some and track impermanent losses too. (In pretty much all usable Blockchain)\n\nFor my usage: I was using the auto cake farm before the crash of December, it was at 70% annual return auto compounded. It's a very good and stable way to generate tokens.\n\nThe best I've made is this:\nPlacing liquidity into a pool with 2 stablecoins. Earning cake on that LP.\nStake the LP, earning cake.\nStake cake autocake earning cake.\n\n\nYou can do that on many plateforms, some even allow you to stake LP from others. (Curve, harvest.finance, among others are allowing this on some pair)\n\n(All of that say, staking is a very good way to start making regular income if done correctly)\n\nYou can also leverage some if you are confident enough, but that's another kind of setup., Next level if I can say.",

As a long term believer of the benefits of Blockchain tech. I did not doubt about finding good projects that provide reasonable staking rewards.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nWith the recent Metaverse narrative, there are lot of Metaverse projects providing great APY.\r  \nJust today I found a project that just launched bonded staking with insane APY of 70%.\r  \nI always find the projects with good fundamentals tho as I do not feel the want to be rugged.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThe project I found today is called Meta Game Hub Dao and newly launched on Bilaxy, 3m MC GEM, Huge collaborations like SAND MANA AXS LINK and they focus on pooling and fractionalization of NFT. They recently launched staking possibilities and all of them have some insane APY at the moment. Definitely worth checking out.",

                    "response": "First of all, you need to understand what staking is. On PoS blockchains validators put up a stake and get to take part in securing the network. You can either set up your own validator or delegate your stake to another validator. \n\n1,000% is extremely unlikely to be staking rewards. Larger, more popular coins are between 20-100% but if you really do find one that offers those kinds of rewards there's a good chance it will inflate itself into oblivion. You might hold 10x the coins but there will be 20x the supply on the market since validators usually take a cut and the coin will be worth less unless its demand explodes. \n\nThis is why it's important to understand market cap as well. Also, if you see APYs in the range that aren't staking rewards, it doesn't mean those are any safer. You could be dealing with a yield farm or liquidity protocol in which case you have to keep the value of liquidity tokens and impermanent loss in mind. \n\nBe careful with DeFi since it offers high yields but it isn't very stable and if you haven't done much research you're better off sticking to established projects with lower but more reliable yields. \n\nFYI, SafeMoon was never a good investment. They'll likely never build anything beyond clones and forks, as they don't have the expertise to do so. It's all hype and most likely will be wrecked by the next bear market.",

            "text": "According to Forbes' 2022 Billionaires rankings, published on Tuesday April 5, Changpeng Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance, is the wealthiest person in crypto, worth an estimated $65 billion. \n\nThat places \"CZ,\" as he is known, as the world's 19th richest person, ahead of well-known American billionaires such as computer entrepreneur Michael Dell and oil tycoon Charles Koch, at the age of 44. \n\nForbes estimates Binance's market worth to be $92.5 billion (based on March 11 market pricing) and Zhao's ownership position to be at least 70% after speaking with crypto industry analysts and individuals familiar with the company.\n\nBinance, which is privately held, does not provide financial or ownership information. Binance is a cryptocurrency exchange based in the Cayman Islands that operates in over 180 countries through a network of connected businesses, a strategy that has prompted regulatory scrutiny. In the last year, regulators in Japan, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong have all issued warnings against the corporation for operating without their license. Bloomberg reported in May 2021 that the United States Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service were investigating Binance for money laundering and tax evasion. Binance said it takes its legal and compliance responsibilities seriously, but declined to respond to specific questions. \n\nBinance has a unique business model that involves issuing its own tokens, known as Binance coin (BNB), to clients and utilizing them as an incentive for trading and recruiting new customers, among the hundreds of crypto exchanges that exist internationally [See Forbes' Global Crypto Exchanges Ranking]. The more BNB coins you own and the more people you bring to the trading platform, the more commissions and discounts you earn in this multi-level marketing scheme. Initially, BNB was primarily used for discount trading, but it has since evolved into a full-fledged cryptocurrency with a variety of payment options on platforms such as competing exchanges like Tycoon.io and Crypto.com.\n\nBinance also does what's known in the crypto space as \"burning,\" or retiring tokens on a regular basis to keep track of the total number of tokens in circulation. Binance ceased burning its native token BNB at a proportionate to profit rate in January 2020, instead choosing for a burn rate connected to trade volume, hiding the public's perception of how much money Binance was making. BNB token has a market valuation of $73 billion, according to CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency pricing website owned by Binance. Because CZ's ownership of BNB coins is unclear, Forbes' net worth assessment excludes it. \n\nCoinbase's successful first public offering (IPO) and $42 billion market capitalization (as of March 11, 2022, when Forbes took a global snapshot of billionaires)\n\nCZ previously skirted about his ownership interest in Binance, telling Forbes in January 2021 that he controlled roughly 30% \u2014possibly: \"I don't actually know what my net worth is.\" In the summer, he added, \"I'm not too troubled about it.\" CZ's ownership in Binance, according to persons familiar with the subject who spoke to Forbes on the condition of anonymity, is significantly higher\u2013at least 70%. (Binance subsidiaries registered in the United Kingdom and Malta suggest CZ controls majority holdings in those companies, while the extent of those businesses inside Binance's bigger Cayman Islands holding company is impossible to determine.) \n\nZhao, like many other crypto millionaires, is a self-made billionaire. In 1977, he was born in Jiangsu, China. His father, a professor, was soon called a \"pro-bourgeois genius\" and deported temporarily. The family relocated to Vancouver, Canada, in the late 1980s.\n\n CZ helped cover household costs as a teenager by flipping burgers at McDonald's and worked nighttime jobs at a petrol station. He began coding at the age of 16 and went on to acquire a computer science degree at McGill University in Montreal.",

According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled their nation since Russia commenced its war in late February. \n\nBinance, a cryptocurrency exchange and also an home to blockchain projects like DAODAO and Plastiks, announced Tuesday that it has introduced a card for Ukrainians who have fled their country due to Russia's invasion, claiming that blockchain-based currency is a good way to meet emergency financial demands.\n\nThe free Binance Refugee Crypto Card is for all current and new Binance users from Ukraine who've been forced to move to European Environment Agency Countries because of the war launched by Russia in late February. The EEA has 32 member countries and is an agency of the European Union.\n\nIn a statement, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange said that displaced Ukrainians can use the card to send and receive crypto payments, as well as make purchases at EEA merchants that accept card payments. \n\"At such a tough moment for Ukraine, it's evident that cryptocurrencies are valuable since they provide a fast, affordable, and safe way of transmitting funds to support individuals with their immediate financial needs,\" Helen Hai, the executive director of Binance Charity, said in a statement. New Binance users must fill out an application that follows the \"Know Your Customer\" criteria.\n\nAccording to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, more than 5 million people have fled Ukraine in pursuit of safety from Russia's invasion. Russia has attacked the capital city of Kyiv, as well as the coastal cities of Mariupol and Odesa, in its campaign against the former Soviet republic.\n\nThe Binance Charity donation platform is collaborating with non-profits to give crypto-based monetary assistance via a card that will allow relatives and acquaintances to send crypto to the cards and Binance wallets. \n\nRefugees who have applied for the card and have been confirmed by local non-profit groups will receive $75 in Binance USD cryptocurrency each month for three months. The BUSD cryptocurrency will be immediately translated to local currency during the card payment, according to the exchange. \n\nBinance announced last week that it would restrict services in Russia in order to comply with EU sanctions imposed on Moscow as a result of the invasion of Ukraine. The EU set a $10,000 ($10,700) limit on Russian payments to EU crypto wallets in order to prevent wealthier Russians from circumventing financial restrictions imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine.",

Hiring Wade appears to be an important part of that plan.\n\n\u201cWad Engineering will be responsible for scalable, compliant and fast Web 3 services and solutions,\u201d Binance said in a release announcing the news. \u201cHe will guide the team to build products that will drive mass adoption of crypto and lower the barrier of entry to Web3 technology.\u201d\n\nWad began his career at Microsoft in the early 1990s, helping to build core software products such as Excel and Bing. After stints at Google and Facebook, he returned to Microsoft in 2016 to take on the role of Corporate VP of Product and Engineering.\n\nBro, it is amazing that crypto-related platforms are now hiring execs from big brands from outside the crypto space. For instance, crypto exchange, Coinbase did the same thing. Open source platform, Tea did the same thing. NFT Marketplace, OpenSea did the same thing. Every good person will soon be working on crypto and NFT.  \n\nOn Friday, Binance also announced that it has appointed Mayur Kamat, a senior executive at Singapore-based travel giant Agoda, as its new VP of Product.",

            "text": "No one trusts the crypto community. Why should they? Majority of projects are rugpulled and investors are scammed on a daily basis. When will this stop? Do people need to start taking their own lives before someone does something about this? Below are four reasons why the community has deteriorated and a call to action/solution below that. \n\nReason 1, AMA Channels take money from developers for broadcast- Cost of AMA to developer: 2-14 BNB ($800-$6000) Process: for one hour the host asks questions/developer answers over voice/video. Potential/current investors ask questions at the end. Some examples on telegram: GodReviews charges 4 BNB, Caesars\\_Calls, 10 BNB, GollumsGems 10BNB,etc \u201cwe do unbiased reviews/ask hard questions and do your own research\u201d are common statements by AMA team. AMA team takes money from developers naturally taking developer side, forgetting investors. Reason for high price: most effective way to advertise a new token. Regardless of project quality, very likely the price will go up shortly before/during/shortly after project\u2019s AMA with highly followed AMA group.\n\nReason  2: Audit Companies take money from projects for audits: Companies like Coinscope and Certik charge developers $2000 for audit. Funded by developers, this is always a conflict of interest for the auditing agency, especially with no guarantees for money back to investors. Recently three highly rated projects audited by Certik got rugpulled: Coyote Coin, Elephant Money and Safuu. Certik pointed out vulnerabilities, but what projects do not have vulnerabilities pointed out? Paying for someone to state something is of high quality is advertising, not an inspection/audit\n\nLet\u2019s pause and talk about micro-worker companies. These include websites like picoworkers, rapidworkers, timebucks and microworkers. Breakdown: \u201cEmployer\u201d paypals $25 to the website and then provides instructions for 500 people from a third world country to \u201cupvote\u201d, \u201clike\u201d, \u201cfollow\u201d, \u201cshare\u201d, \u201cjoin\u201d, etc. 500 people earn 5 cents to upload proof of work screenshot. Repeat process x number of times. Depending on country/region, many are overworked 14 hours a day, less than $150 a month full time job. YouTube companies for more info.  Development teams use these to inflate their numbers. Don\u2019t believe me? Read on\u2026  \nReason 3: Developers use microworker companies to Inflate upvotes, followers, telegram membership numbers/comments/likes: Coinsniper, coinscope, coinhunters, nextcoin, coinalpha, freshcoins, coinvote, coinfair, watcher, coinmooner, coincyclop are upvote websites. At the time of this post I did a simple experiment, visited coinscope website and sampled top voted token. Project name: Puli\\_Token ($PULI). Before I make the below statements, I must give the disclaimer: I have not looked at the project\u2019s utility, or smart contract, not inferring this is a scam project or to avoid. Sorry Puli\\_token devs, you were at the top on coinscope during my research and your numbers don\u2019t make sense, so you get to be my not so good guinea pig. (again I did not search long for this, it was literally the first project opened)\n\nTo continue my point: 100,924 votes on coinscope at this time, yet only 437 members on subreddit, 46,200 twitter followers  and 18,858 members in telegram. Besides the fact that these numbers are very lopsided (why only 437 in reddit?), simple addition from all communities, (65,495) does not come anywhere near 100,924 (you can only vote once). How many are the same individuals from different platforms? \n\nAdditionally, 46k followers on twitter with only 119 comments/254 retweets/366 likes on their most recent posts in three days does not add up. My evaluation: the development team used microworkers to inflate coin upvote, twitter  following, and telegram members. Then did not pay attention to detail/cheaped out inflating tweets to match. Is 437 reddit members the actual following for this project?\n\nReason 4: micro-task companies used on Crypto Info pages as well: have you looked at a subreddit like cryptomoonshots lately? 1.7 million members?!. Yet drastic comment variation: post with zero comments to a few thousand upvotes with only 13 comments including a very sharp change between two posts, showing 24 comments on top screen and only 4 comments inside (microworker comments that are blocked showing artificial inflation).\n\nAdditionally, getting access to the views chart, I would be willing to bet money it went from zero upvotes one minute, 2000 votes next minute to 0 votes again. How can this be possible? Again, developer employing a microworker company to inflate numbers. When the job comes into picoworkers, it typically gets executed very quickly creating a quick spike followed by no activity. Compare cryptomoonshots posts/participation to a legit subreddit like r/CryptoCurrency. CryptoCurrency has an even distribution of upvotes and comments. Typically, there are more comments than upvotes and they happen very gradually. When I post on r/CryptoCurrency I usually see 30k views. The moderators of a subreddit like cryptomoonshots wont let me post there, because they know I will see that not one person looked at my post because they are all microworkers that just followed. Intent for mods? Scam to charge new developers money to post their project in a group of 1.7m fake members that wont do anything.\n\nCall to Action: \n\nThe above current system encourages everyone to invest in a project that can pay their way to the top. It steals opportunities away from developers that are bright and talented, with great ideas.\n\nSolution:\n\n1. If an AMA team accepts money from the project for broadcast, don\u2019t listen or join them. If you do join, calmly raise your hand and ask the question on how much the development team paid to have the AMA. r/CryptoCraversLLC does free AMAs. Developers can reach out, but since this is free, don\u2019t be surprised if we upset you with our line of questions. \n\n2. If you know audit company charged developers for audit, ask for re-audit from someone who they did not pay/is unbiased. If rugpulls happen after an audit, spread the word to other communities that use the same audit company.\n\n3.  Don\u2019t look at upvote companies unless they have anti-microtask worker protocols in place. If they are mentioned, stone wall comment that all upvote companies are a scam unless there are clear anti-microworker protocols in place. Voice your opinion on social media platforms that are scams. Report them to the social media platform if something does not look right, don't turn a blind eye. \n\nFinally, please share/voice this posts information to inform and educate the crypto community: let's start a revolution! put all of these companies out of business and change this space together!",

            "text": "On Wednesday, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao praised France's \"pro-crypto\" policies, as the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange pursues plans to establish a European hub in Paris. \n\nZhao, who goes by the initials CZ, is attempting to register Binance as a \"digital asset service provider\" with the French market regulator AMF (DASP). \n\nOver a dozen national regulators, including those in Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, issued concerns about Binance last year. It was operating without a license in several jurisdictions, according to some. Others warned against using the company's services.\n\nBinance has stated that it welcomes regulation and collaborates with governments throughout the world and is therefore enhancing its reputation as the best crypto platform out there over others like Coinbase and Tycoon. \n\nOn Wednesday, Zhao stated that French President Emmanuel Macron's government was open to the mostly unregulated cryptocurrency business. \n\n\"France has some really pro-business, pro-crypto policies, and (the) government's attitude toward this industry... has been wonderful,\" he told a crowded conference held in the historic edifice of the Paris stock exchange. \n\nAccording to a chart showed during Zhao's lecture, Binance is already the most popular cryptocurrency exchange in France.\n\nLast month, the exchange announced that it had been granted permission to perform limited operations in Dubai, from where it intends to conduct regional business. Bahrain's central bank has also granted it a license to operate as a crypto-asset service provider. find out more \n\nZhao, who said late last year that France may become the site of Binance's worldwide headquarters, made no mention of the French presidential election runoff, in which Macron faces far-right leader Marine Le Pen. \n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao has vowed to invest 100 million euros in France and announced that he has secured an agreement to donate two million euros to the restoration of a room at the Chateau de Versailles.\n\nAlthough the AMF has not yet published its verdict, a finance ministry official stated in January that France welcomed the expansion of the cryptocurrency business. \n\nA request for comment on Binance's registration was not immediately returned by an AMF spokeswoman. \n\nBinance has previously hidden information from regulators, maintained inadequate customer checks, and acted against its own compliance department's recommendations, according to a Reuters investigation published in January. \n\nBinance responded by stating that it is pushing for stronger standards in the cryptocurrency business. Binance has never concealed information from regulators, according to Zhao.",

            "text": " \n\nTitle, Judge Judy style.\n\nFor a little bit of context, I filed a lawsuit against BAM TRADING SERVICES INC. aka Binance U.S. in the court of San Francisco, CA, small claims division.\n\nI was a customer of the original Binance website, and couldn't get my account or bank account verified with Binance U.S. for over 9 months, and it magically only became verified just as the bull run ended this year. I contacted customer service \\*many\\* times, many times.\n\nWhen I contacted customer service, I would receive no reply for weeks at a time. I found notices finally that said they were backlogged and 'doing their best,' but they were still taking new customers, this button never disappeared despite the backlog claim. Binance U.S. took all my information, promised me the basic ability to buy, sell, and trade crypto, and held my account until the coins I would purchase were at maximum cost. I relied on Binance U.S. to verify my account in a timely fashion once they took all my sensitive personal information, my social security number, my bank account routing, account, and balance numbers. My address. My phone number.\n\nI imagine the only counter argument is 'you could have gone to a different exchange.' Each time I received notice from Binance, they assured me it was temporary, and honestly, am I supposed to just spam all these details all over the internet in \\*the hope\\* that one of the parties receiving it is honest about their offereing? I don't see how any of this is in good faith, so I filed a lawsuit for the losses. I have a lot of documentation proving even the specific cryptocurrency I was trying to purchase as well.\n\nWhen I contacted Binance parent company a couple times, I got an instant same day response, just like you would expect from the world's largest cryptocurrency market. They know this is a reasonable expectation. I read a lot that Binance U.S. is just a regulatory cover to keep the real activity on Binance. I'm not rich, I'm not deep into the market, I just wanted to buy a reasonable amount of cryptocurrency after the election ended. I saw someone else post about how Binance did the exact same thing to them, and how they literally cried at the loss, and I decided I would file my lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit was very easy to file. I looked up Binance U.S.' business records, starting with the info from their website. I found BAM TRADING SERVICES INC with the secretary of state(every state has some kind of collection of records of corporations doing business inside of them), I filled out all the required paperwork, and asked the court to serve the papers. I am indigent, so it cost literally nothing. Yes, you can file a lawsuit over something like this without spending a penny if you are poor. Do the reading, we should all know how to do it.\n\nSo today, I got a text today from a producer at the television show 'Hot Bench' in Los Angeles, CA. They've asked if I would like to litigate my case on their show. I could sue Binance U.S on live television, and everyone in the crypto community could watch.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nP.S. - For the record, I'm clearly a big fan of crypto, I wanted to buy in at what I think is a terrific safe time: after the election when everyone remembers the current system is dogshit and starts buying out. This isn't an attack on crypto, I just want these people to play fair with us if they are going to become disgustingly rich along the way.",

I\u2019m all for sticking it to big industry but a glaring hole in your argument is that you are not able to quantify your loss. Your case is based on undeterminable profits/losses, equally, if the market went down would you still be suing them? I like your passion and persistence but your case is a non-starter.",

With the expansion of cryptocurrency exchanges in the Middle East, and the region showing an increased interest in the NFT space, the ecosystem is poised to see exponential growth. Fundamentally sound projects linked to the NFT space like Quint, Mana, Enjin, and Axie Infinity will likely enjoy Middle Eastern investors' interest.\n\nAccording to a statement by Binance's Head of MENA, Richard Teng:\n\"Binance has been actively engaging global regulators, such as ADGM, as part of its ongoing commitment to uphold global standards and collectively foster the developments and sustainable growth of the crypto ecosystem.\"\n\nHe further mentioned that Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, is contemplating making Dubai his \"base for the foreseeable future.\"",

I would like to buy a cryptocurrency with low market cap (I already have in mind what to buy), do you think this figure is too low to get anything good in the future? \nA month I get pocket money of about \u20ac 80/100 and I could invest that too every month. \nI don't work, I still go to school. Am I just a fool to believe I can do something with so little money? maybe I should spend it on a next gen console or some clothes? I state that I am aware of being able to lose them, what would you do in my place?",

Its government will reverse opposition to cryptocurrencies for the good of Great China\n* Russia will fall into desolation and be disgorged economically and socially in the western world\n* Some benefits such as economies of scale and efficiency from globalization will diminish worldwide, more so outside the EU and the Americas\n* Cryptocurrency's total market capitalization will exceed $150+ Trillion USD.\n\n**15 years of stupendous crypto growth has commenced.**\n\nEpochal challenges and changes have commenced worldwide, sadly caused by a blood-thirsty Putin killing helpless women, disabled, children, orphans, etc\n\nEU, European nations, and the U.K. will spend huge and reconstruct Defence and Energy. Demand and Construction will increase, likewise prosperity.\n\nPrice rises for Oil, Energy, and Commodities will cause inexorable inflationary pressure and inflation will be in excess of 5% in the short to medium term across dependent countries. In the long term the dislocation within, and regression from globalization will result in, almost immutable, inflationary pressures globally, especially in dependent countries.\n\n**And, oh, add decreases in Efficiency.**\n\nThe power, spheres of influence, and economy of China will needlessly fall due to its support of Russia, irrespective of its understandable anti-American perspective. Nevertheless, its stance will come at a net cost to Great China. Thus, possibly throwing away its golden chance to usurp or replace the USA in some respects in world affairs.\n\n**The world needs a prosperous and Great China.**\n\nPutin has atrociously ostracized Russia for at least two more generations after this, with his evil-laden and senseless war. The gross miscalculation of Putin and the Russian Army in invading a peaceful, progressive Ukraine and friendly Ukrainian people is a game-changer in world affairs, world trade, and will cause a realignment in various economies, increase inflation and provide fodder and a massive accelerator for the adoption and growth of cryptocurrencies worldwide.\n\nChina can't save Russia, neither its brain drain nor corporate exodus. It has instead helped to solidify the dominant position of the USD and by extension spur the growth and entrenchment of the world\u2019s sole superpower, the USA.\n\n**Why?**\n\nIt\u2019s now practically impossible to replace the USD in global trade or in Russia\u2019s trade with the world or the USD as the world\u2019s prime reference currency.\n\nThe USD is in widespread use worldwide and it\u2019s backed by a democratic government system, the largest and most liquid bond market, furthermore by higher hydrocarbons production, and by the world\u2019s largest economy with an unparalleled innovation culture, and equity markets, and venture capital sector.\n\n**Still, looking for further proof?**\n\n[The Executive Order on Digital Assets by President Biden on 9.3.22](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/) will accelerate the innovative streak of God\u2019s own country, the USA.\n\nCryptocurrency's prospects have never looked or been this good. Viewed from all perspectives including governmental, inflationary pressures, and huge public awareness, institutional adoption, and HODL; cryptocurrencies will invariably and inexorably rise in value, become pervasive, and a powerful driver for creating prosperous peoples across the world.\n\n**Global poverty will be lower.**\n\nAll told, earthly factors and the gods favor cryptocurrencies and related sectors. I foresee stupendous growth in the total market cap of cryptocurrencies in excess of $150T, powered by endemic adoption worldwide and the proliferation of cryptocurrencies.\n\n[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy Mr. Michael[Ultainfinity Global Group](http://ultainfinity.com/)Founder, Chairman & Group CEO",

            "text": " \n\nYep, I get it. Boomers aren't cool.\u00a0 We are old, seemingly grumpy, not risk takers, and old school. But please, give me a minute to make you think. We were once college students or just young folks struggling to make it just like you.\n\nHere are some thoughts:\n\n1. Keep your day job. (Or get a day job!) Mine fiat by hard work every day to invest in cryptocurrency if that's your goal. Work hard and efficiently.\n\nYou'll be happier working - I don't care how many people want to stay home and do nothing. You'll get bored. Or depressed. Or start drinking. I promise, it's not all roses having no purpose in life.  Crypto = Great. Crypto + a Job = Wonderful!\n\n2. Even if you get your moon, stay in school or build your dream.\u00a0 Start a business, do what you love - not what you're told to love;\u00a0 go to trade school or college, even the school of hard knocks. Just get educated, wherever, however, you can. Money is not the goal......a better life is.\n\n3. Your 20's, 30's and 40s may take you far from family and loved ones, but work hard to keep connected with them as they will become even more important to you with each passing decade. (Not crypto advice but living advice!)\n\n4. Investing is risky. Don't invest what you don't have. Pay off debt (I learned this the hard way) and your life will be so much more worry free and happier. Buy necessities such as a simple car or house before that Lambo. Only risk what you can afford to lose. Don't dabble in meme coins unless you have lots of extra money you can afford to throw around.\n\n5.\u00a0 Getting Rich Quick is usually a scam. If it were easy,\u00a0 why doesn't everyone do it? Stay away from poo coins. Don't get angry when older people suggest that meme coins have no long term value. Most or all will not. Even Doge's time will come, it will grow old and out of people's minds unless it quickly develops more use cases. Stay off CryptoMoonShots.\n\nFinally, failure is okay, even in Crypto. Each investment will teach you a lesson. Each time you sell will give you information. You twenty and thirty somethings have a LIFE CHANGING opportunity with cryptocurrencies. Remember it might take time,\u00a0 don't sell on a whim or a worry.\n\nGood luck, I hope you each reach your moons, no matter what it is!",

From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from books to our weekly Moonshot Monday podcast. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)\n\n**Market Overview**\n\nIt was a tough month in the crypto markets with sentiment at [Extreme Fear](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/) and the market falling by 20% over the last 30 days.\n\nIt has to be said that the market weakness shows no sign of abating. That makes picking winners virtually impossible in the short term. To counter this negative sentiment we must continue to buy on weakness and hold our favorite projects until the market turns. The time will come, but the flight must be to quality. That buy and hold approach is not going to work with overvalued memecoins and projects with no fundamentals and users. Avoid new projects that have anonymous teams and triple check [OHM](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/olympus) forks and metaverse projects before investing, many of these are scams.\n\nIt's better to be holding stable coins in this market sell off and only a few fundamentally sound projects.\n\n**Trending**\n\n**Rapid fire**\n\nCrypto investors lost over $2.8 billion to \u2018rug pulls\u2019. That represented 37% of the over $7.7 billion in illicit profits from cryptos cams this year. One such recent rug pull was at Candela Coin, the solar power blockchain project. The founder did a runner, briefly raising his chubby little face to complain of a hack and then disappearing again when investors turned up the heat. You can read the full story of this classic rug pull below.\n\nBitMart the crypto exchange was hacked, looting the exchange of $150 million of mainly second rate tokens.\n\nIt has been claimed that once women start buying and using crypto in a similar vein to men crypto will have reached mass adoption. Some claim we are there now. However, depending on the view you take, the signs are positive. Australia for instance, where adoption is already high, has seen women holding crypto double in 2021.\n\nShiba Inu, the memecoin inspired by Dogecoin and Elon Musk, saw its market cap rise to the point where it became the 13th most valuable cryptocurrency briefly overtaking Dogecoin. At a valuation of $16 billion we have to ask ourselves, has the market correction got further to go?\n\nDecentralized exchanges are often seen as an effective way of protecting your privacy. But don\u2019t be so sure. Many of the biggest ones are tracking their users' trades and collecting data that could be used to identify them. Uniswap admits it is in cahoots with analytics companies to do exactly that, a shocker for most of us!\n\nMany countries are clamping down on the use of crypto. Turkey is next on the cards. However there are countries which are crypto friendly. These are the top nine. Antigua, Canada, El Salvador, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, Netherlands, Singapore and The British Virgin Islands.\n\nBinance Coin was the best performer of the three top cryptocurrencies of 2021 rising by 1344%. The adoption of Binance's smart chain was partly the reason for this phenomenal rise. It is now the place to find innovative exciting projects which was definitely not the case only a few months ago.\n\n**Developments at CryptoQuestion**\n\n**Receive your free monthly newsletter by subscribing** [**here**](https://cryptoquestion.tech/newsletter/)\n\n**Moonshot TV going strong**\n\nLast month our very own Moonshot launched his new show, Moonshot Weekly.

According to the announcement, the approval in principle is the first for a Binance entity in the Middle East and North Africa region.\n\nIn a statement, Binance CEO Changpend Zhao, or \"CZ,\" said the approval from national regulators is \"essential to build trust in cryptocurrencies and blockchain and help further enhance mass adoption.\"\n\nWhen it comes to licensing, it is \"a matter of paperwork,\" according to Abdulkarim Haji, director of licensing at the country's central bank. He highlighted Bahrain as the ideal place for [Binance development ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/bep20-token-development)to establish its headquarters in the region.\n\nIn a surprise move, Binance also obtained a crypto financing license in Canada, incorporated as Binance Canada Capital Market. The exchange's new subsidiary will handle digital assets, money transfers, currency exchange, and will function as a money services business (MSB).\n\nCZ confirmed the license on Twitter. He said the company is excited to expand its customer support team to include clients and other cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nOn Friday, the cryptocurrency exchange applied to FINTRAC for an MSB license and it was approved on Monday. The exchange's current financial license will expire on December 31, 2024.\n\nBahrain, the gulf's smallest economy, has pioneered the digital asset sector. Rain Financial became the first licensed crypto asset platform in the region after receiving permission from the country's central bank to operate in 2019 . In January, the Bahraini monetary authority renewed a license for Manama-based CoinMENA .\n\nBinance's decision reflects the company's increased focus on the Middle East region. The company recently became the first cryptocurrency exchange to join the new crypto hub established by the Dubai World Trade Center Authority, Cointelegraph reported.\n\nBinance's regulatory odyssey has been nothing short of exciting in 2021 as the cryptocurrency exchange continues to expand into new countries and gain proper regulatory approval. At the same time, it has faced serious criticism, warnings and fines from various authorities.\n\nRecently, Binance Turkey was fined $ 750,000 by the Financial Crime Investigation Board for failing to meet the requirements of financial surveillance reporting.",

            "text": "Almost everyone in blockchain industry knows something about mining. But to take care of the few, let me tell you what mining is: simply put, mining is the process of mining machines, which are loaded with specialized chips that help calculating cryptos' location and obtaining cryptos. Complex calculation will be performed during transactions, and miners use computers to run those calculations to gain Bitc oin or other cryptocurrencies. \n\nIn 2021, mining has divided into two major modes: traditional mining & cloud hashrate mining. Why cloud mining appeals to rookie miners and how it became so popular? Let\u2019s take a look! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bh9ya9y2h481.png?width=1251&format=png&auto=webp&s=6360796924ed69165d41339dcc874b4c0fc5c5e6\n\nIn early mining history, people were able to mine using calculating capacity of personal computers and a mining software. But as more and more miners flooding into the industry, mining difficulty has risen up and professional GPU mining machines started to emerge on the market. As mining investment rose, regular miners are basically excluded from mining. However, as mining model upgrades, cloud mining model appeared, which made everyone eligible to mine cryptos. \n\nRegular PC is far from enough to participate in traditional crypto mining now, specialized GPU mining machine is a must. If someone wants to mine cryptocurrency, they have to buy mining machines and set up their own machine room. Not to mention installation, management, maintenance and etc. You may choose to spending days looking for a reliable agent to help you manage mining, but it\u2019s also a cumbersome process to handover your mining machines to them. \n\nFortunately, cloud mining perfectly clears the barriers that have been keeping regular people from mining. Cloud mining is a remote mining model, it means you can participate no matter where you are. Cloud mining service providers sells hashrate on their platforms, which comes from mining farms built by themselves or with other companies. Cloud mining is extremely flexible and effective, it\u2019s bound to own a dominating place on the market. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f7h2a6jy2h481.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5809b8230189580ba2e54c34907824162066cb25\n\nEssentially cloud mining and traditional mining are the same, since they all require mining machines and have to face common mining problems. The main difference is that with cloud mining, users don\u2019t need to look after their machines, it\u2019s a very simple way to begin their mining journey. All they have to do is selecting a premium trustworthy cloud mining platform like [LuckyHash](https://www.luckyhash.com/?utm_source=english&utm_medium=official). LuckyHash allows you to mine with low cost and its revenues are so high that sometimes even more profitable than buying machines yourselves. Also [LuckyHash](https://www.luckyhash.com/?utm_source=english&utm_medium=official) provides products of different contract periods, so that you can invest in mining on a very flexible manner and almost of no prerequisites. Such terms simply don\u2019t exist in traditional mining industry in 2021, that\u2019s why the masses are moving towards cloud mining industry. \n\nAlthough cloud mining is an excellent way to mine, vital factors such as whether have hashrate from real mining farms, mining efficiency, platform service capacity have be considered. That\u2019s why you have to find a reliable and powerful cloud mining platform.",

From an on-demand Q&A service to online courses, from our weekly Moonshot Monday podcast to our weekly Staking and Farming Review. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)\n\nMark Twain once said, \u2018Buy land, they're not making it anymore\u2019. Those words of wisdom have stood the test of time until the metaverse came along.\n\nWhen Facebook announced they were changing their name to Meta it shone a light on a space which the mainstream hadn't fully appreciated. The metaverse.\n\nHowever as usual the crypto community was way ahead of the curve. Blockchain entrepreneurs have been busily developing metaverse applications for a few years now, Facebook just gave it mainstream recognition. Before that announcement the average person hadn't even heard of the metaverse and if they had they didn't have a clue what it meant.\n\nHere is a brief definition for those in the metaverse beginner camp:\n\nA shared, realistic, and immersive computer simulation of the real world or other possible worlds, in which people participate as digital avatars.\n\nInvestors have been piling into cryptocurrencies with even a faint connection to the metaverse well before the Facebook announcement. A recent report by the crypto fund manager Grayscale estimated the potential value of the market at $1 trillion. However mainstream adoption is probably some five to ten years away. Microsoft and Apple are other big players who have recognized the potential with Apple looking to enter the augmented reality market with the imminent launch of a range of smart glasses.\n\nThis article aims to look at some of the main operators in the crypto metaverse space and identify where investors should be investing their money to take advantage of this massive potential market.\n\n**Join us on Telegram**[ ](https://t.me/joinchat/htKJi3PkuyJiM2U5)[**here**](https://t.me/joinchat/htKJi3PkuyJiM2U5) **for lively debate and quality investment ideas. With an absence of shilling and spam this is the Telegram channel of choice for many crypto enthusiasts.**\n\n**The significance of the metaverse**\n\nThe first question we have to ask ourselves before getting involved in financial matters is, why is the metaverse so significant?\n\nCurrently most applications in the metaverse relate to games. These include play-to-earn games which have proved popular in the crypto world such as Axie Infinity and The Sandbox. There is also the likes of Roblox, Fortnite and Minecraft which you can play within their own metaverses. Facebook intends to build yet another metaverse or as some have called it \u2018a walled metaverse\u2019. However the metaverse is much more than just games.\n\nImagine putting on your VR glasses and doing your shopping in your favorite store whilst sitting on your sofa. Imagine going to a Vegas casino and standing at a virtual roulette table and soaking up the atmosphere surrounded by other excitable players and no doubt a few dancing girls. Imagine having a drink with friends in a virtual pub.\n\nThat is why the metaverse is in fact bigger than a trillion dollar market.\n\nHowever all this potential presents a problem for the investor...\n\n**Top five metaverse crypto projects**\n\nBefore we examine this \u2018problem\u2019 let\u2019s first look at the top 5 cryptos in the metaverse:\n\n$B $FD\n\nAxie Infinity 8.8 36.0 Blockchain based play-to-earn game\n\nDecentraland 5.7 9.5 VR world\n\nThe Sandbox 5.6 18.5 VR world\n\nEnjin Coin 3.1 3.3 VR gaming community\n\nIlluvium 1.0 16.5 VR play-to-earn game developer\n\nIt doesn't take a crypto analyst like our very own Moonshot to quickly work out that much of the future potential of the metaverse has already been factored into the valuations of most crypto projects in the space. Take for example Axie Infinity, with a fully diluted market cap of $36 billion that assumes that Axie will command 3.6% of the total future $1 trillion market. That appears totally unrealistic to a sober observer.\n\nThere is no arguing this sector is going to explode. The question is, where to invest your money where you will enjoy at least some of the coming upside as opposed to buying into projects where most of the upside has already gone?\n\n**It has been described as one of the most invaluable resources in the world of altcoin investing. We couldn\u2019t agree more. Download your free Micro Cap Watch List from our website**[ ](https://cryptoquestion.tech/micro-cap-watch-list/)[**here**](https://cryptoquestion.tech/micro-cap-watch-list/) **and receive it in your inbox every Friday.**\n\n**Selection #!**\n\nFrom the top 5 list we like the look of Decentraland. Let\u2019s be real, Decentraland is no moonshot. With a fully diluted market cap of $9.5 billion it is far from undervalued however what we like about Decentraland is it is more than just games. They are looking to build a virtual world that encompases some of the things we talked about earlier, fashion, entertainment, in fact anything you would find in the real world.\n\n*Decentraland is a lightbulb moment for anyone interested in investigating the investment potential of the metaverse.*\n\nDecentraland has two investment plays. The first is investing in its cryptocurrency. The second is buying land. We have already looked briefly at the valuation of Decentraland\u2019s token. Now let's look at its virtual land.\n\nVirtual land is like real estate. It is in finite supply with location playing an important factor in its value. Canny investors are buying up virtual land plots within Decentraland\u2019s metaverse with the expectation of either developing it, renting it or flipping it. In the last 7 days alone there was $100 million in land transactions nearly 20% of which related to Decentraland ($80 Million related to The Sandbox).\n\nHowever the average investor has been priced out of this market already with land changing hands recently at an average of $22,000 per 33ft x 33ft plot (an investor paid $2.43 million for 116 plots).\n\nIf we had money to burn we would consider purchasing our own plot of land on Decenraland and buying a few tokens in its native token MANA when the price shows signs of weakness.\n\n**Selection #2**\n\nThe next question is, what projects outside the top five represent good value?\n\nA good place to start your search for undervalued metaverse crypto projects is [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/metaverse).\n\nA project that grabbed our attention was Somnium Space CUBE\u2019s (CUBE).\n\nWith a market cap of $238 million and a fully diluted value of $1.9 billion it is not cheap by any means!\n\nLaunched in 2018 by a team based in the UK, Somnium Space has built a VR world with a blockchain based economy. Selling NFTs and ERC20 in game currency and providing immersive VR experiences from entertainment to education. This is their blurb not ours.\n\nWhat they fail to mention is that they are also [selling \u2018parcels\u2019 of land](https://map.somniumspace.com/) in their virtual world. Compared to Decentraland\u2019s land plots these are far more affordable for the average investor and are worth a closer look.\n\nAgain as a moonshot Sominum fails to make the grade however as a bet on the metaverse sector as a whole it is a decent pick.\n\n**Now the moonshot**\n\nRegular followers of CryptoQuestion will be familiar with our third selection. Rentible (RNB).\n\n[Rentible (RNB) price today, chart, market cap & news | CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rentible)\n\nRentible is a solution bringing decentralized Proptech to the masses enabling tenants and landlords to conveniently send and receive rental payments in various cryptocurrencies.\n\nRentible has sought to position itself as a first-mover in this niche. Its platform is in development and is expected to be deployed in beta form in December this year.\n\nAs a platform targeted at landlords and tenants this is an attractive proposition as crypto moves into the mainstream and landlords look at offering alternative forms of payment and of course additional ways of earning money. By offering a complete package Rentible could gain traction and become a go to solution for landlords. This alone is a massive market. However it is the recent news that Rentible is entering the meterverse gold rush that powered Rentible into our metaverse selections. Rentible announced that it will be the first digital marketplace for leasing virtual properties across the metaverse.\n\nRentible\u2019s fully diluted token valuation of only $9 million doesn\u2019t take into account its new position in the metaverse.\n\nIt won't be long before owners of virtual land will be renting it as a way of generating an income. This has the potential to be a massive market in the not too distant future with investors in land already looking for ways to generate income. Rentible has a real possibility of taking a big chunk of this infant market.\n\nIt is rare to come across reasonably priced projects with real use cases that have also identified a realistic way of making money from the metaverse. Rentible is a true gem.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe metaverse is an area crypto investors should investigate. It is set to be an integral part of our future. However it has to be said, the vast majority of metaverse projects are what we call priced to perfection. Investors should look for price weaknesses to buy into their favorite projects and keep their eyes open for that killer project which decides to tread its own path to success. Rentible could be one such project, however there will be others. Patience is important when the crowd is in a frenzy. The metaverse crypto market is likely to undergo a major correction at some point, the question you have to ask yourself is, do you get into some of the larger projects now or wait?\n\nA few words of warning to end with. Avoid rushing out to buy the next shiny metaverse cryptocurrency. 99.9% of new projects coming to market will fail. Also remember, buying virtual land comes with risk. Like buying land in the real world, if you purchase a plot within a metaverse where there are few visitors your land will have as much value as buying land in the middle of the Sahara.\n\nFollow us on Twitter[ ](https://twitter.com/cryptoimpartial)[@cryptoimpartial](https://twitter.com/cryptoimpartial) and Instagram[ ](https://www.instagram.com/cryptoimpartial/)[@cryptoimpartial](https://www.instagram.com/cryptoimpartial/) and register for our newsletter here[ ](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)[www.cryptoquestion.tech](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)\n\nJoin our Telegram channel[ ](https://t.me/joinchat/htKJi3PkuyJiM2U5)[here](https://t.me/joinchat/htKJi3PkuyJiM2U5).\n\nNo Financial Advice\n\nThis report does not constitute financial advice or a recommendation to buy in any way.

            "text": "According to data from Chainalysis, the number of DEX doubled between the first quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2021, while the amount of CEX remained more or less the same.\n\nA new report from Chainalysis shows that the number of decentralized exchanges (DEX) is growing faster than all other types of cryptocurrency exchanges. But data from Similar Web shows that centralized exchanges are far from unpopular, with Binance registering 171 million visitors in October.\n\nChainalysis released a report on cryptocurrency exchanges on November 11 and provided an analysis breaking down exchanges based on their business models, including DEX, CEX, over-the-counter (OTC) brokers, derivatives platforms, and high-risk exchanges with minimal know-how requirements. to your customer (KYC).\n\nAccording to the data, the number of DEX between the first quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2021 increased more than 100% to stand at approximately 205 in June of this year. By comparison, the number of CEXs temporarily increased from around 100 to 120, before dropping back down to the region of 100 within that period.\n\nThe number of OTC brokers also increased significantly, gaining around 50% to hit the 150 mark in Q3 2021. The number of derivatives exchanges increased slightly to around 125 in 2019, and since So it has basically remained in that region, while high-risk exchanges burst in mid-2020 to around 150, before falling sharply below 100 in the third quarter of 2021.\n\n\"Of course, the number of active exchanges in each category is not the only way to judge the health of those categories. At the end of the day, cryptocurrency companies do not just survive, they need to increase their user base and the volume of transactions to prosper, \" says the report.\n\nHowever, across all categories, the number of small exchanges has decreased, suggesting that the exchange market can no longer host niche players. The lesson? Exchanges need to reach a mass audience, or a small audience of large-scale traders, to continue trading.\n\nChainalysis noted that the growing popularity of DEXs in the past two years has coincided with the \"explosive growth of the DeFi category in general.\" The firm highlighted that the total value received by DEXs grew from around USD 10 billion in July 2020 to a peak of USD 368 billion in May 2021, marking an increase of approximately 3579%.\n\n### Binance is still king\n\nDespite the fact that in recent months it has faced intense scrutiny and pressure from regulators around the world, the data shows that the centralized exchange [development of Binance ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/bep20-token-development)continues to be above its competitors.\n\nAccording to Similar Web data compiled by Finbold, Binance had the highest web traffic of all exchanges in October, with a total of 171 million visitors. The figure represents a 12% increase compared to the previous month. Coinbase ranks second with 91 million visitors last month, and had a 31% increase in traffic compared to the previous month.\n\nIn particular, the third most popular exchange is PancakeSwap, a DEX that operates on the [development of Binance Smart Chain](https://www.blockchainx.tech/bep20-token-development) , with 25 million visitors and a 14% month-over-month increase. While Bybit is in fourth place with 24 million (8% less than in September).\n\nData from Coingecko shows that Binance is far ahead of its competitors in terms of volume, with the platform moving more than $ 33.3 billion in the last 24 hours. This figure is more than five times higher than the total for Coinbase, which is in second place, and which generated a volume of $ 6.6 billion in the same period.\n\nOn Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that former Binance executives estimated that the company could be worth as much as $ 300 billion if it went public . It is unclear when or how Binance will go public, considering that it does not have a formal headquarters. However, CEO Changpeng Zhao said in September that Binance's US subsidiary was considering an initial public offering (IPO) in 2024.",

            "text": "So I was going to purchase Cindicator on Binance, but have read elsewhere about their withdrawal fees and amounts being really high on some coins. So before transferring my funds and purchasing, I decided to check.\n\nNow, 400 minimum withdrawal amount on Cindicator isn't bad as the price is only 17 cents, so 68 dollars worth, no problem. Then I look at the fee and it is 180 Cindicator which is 30 dollars and that is ridiculous!\n\nIt is understandable that the market moves fast and fees need to be adjusted to reflect the current price, but I believe they are losing business and customers with the current setup. Part of cryptocurrency is being your own bank and securing your coins, there are a lot of people that do not want their coins sitting on an exchange waiting until they lower their fees accordingly. \n\nAs someone that is fairly influential on crypto Twitter, I have considered recommending this exchange based on the good things I've heard. After hearing about some of the fee problems and now that I have seen it firsthand, I have reconsidered. \n\nEdit: Just checked their Ethos withdrawal fee and it's over $19. *cough* highway robbery *cough*",

We got a talking, she said the bank was actively running interference on any crypto related transactions. The bank association they are part of paid a firm to come in to all member banks to update their fraud system to catch any crypto related payments that was a gew years ago.\n They created a year back ONE more Anti money laundering/Know your customer compliance officer for digital currency to oversee all related transactions to deal with the substantial increase in reviews taking place because of the minimum 10 working day hold put in place for crypto related transactions.  When it involves a incoming transaction from a exchange or settlement firm like Paxos. They have them review it no matter the amount. \nThey ask for a substantial paper trail, how much, how many, what asset was the purchase/settlement that resulted in the the fiat currency being sent in. Their reasoning is they must know what it was in so they can do a check if any sanctioned persons are involved. If the project heads are anonymous then its a no go. Basically if it was kept on exchange and made the profit there, it will go through. If you defi at all it is a no go. They stated because most of the crypto sphere do not KYC/AML [DEX's swaps like uniswap and AMM like Aave, compound] they can't possibly know if your pool profits came from a transaction that involved a sanctioned Russian, North korean or Iranian. Fucking for real!\nI asked how many complaints do they get a month by account holders concerning crypto related problems. She said over 50 but it is nowhere near enough to warrant their response because they have way more unauthorized POS transactions and fraudulent uses of cards when account holders go overseas for vacation.\n\nThe chairman who is also the founder and majority Holder of their stock became obsessed with the in and outflows over the past few years apparently really coming to head the past year.\nThey created more promotions for their investment arm to target those with crypto related transactions. They would send a Grayscale packet and so many emails about Gbtc the bitcoin fund. \n They went so far as to ban all bitcoin ATM transactions under the guise of fraudulent transactions and the inability to reverse the \"bitcoin\", even though they only had a few fraud cases which involved relatives using holders bankcard to buy btc/eth/ltc. The real issue they had was the millions that went to bitcoin ATMs over the past years and the few million that went to exchanges over the course of 6 months this year when btc peaked.",

If you get in the chat queue there are always 100s of people in but it just randomly disconnects you long before you get to number 1. I have tried at least 20 times in the last two weeks. The chat just randomly ends.\n\nWorse and even more offensive than ignoring your ticket they wait three days and then send you an automated response saying that your ticket must have resolved itself since they didn't answer you in so long. Sounds like a joke but it's true. It's amazing that Zendesk would even build a product that allows users to ignore, reply form letter spam and then auto delete/close tickets - maybe it was a custom build for Binance!\n\nThis is exactly what they write back after several days of ignoring your ticket (broken English of course):\n\n\"Hello,Due to it has taken longer than usual to get your response of the ticket. Therefore, it is supposed that the issue has been solved already. \"",

I even see that team is thinking to open window for people who didnt transfer to new token so they really care about it. CEO itself stated that stmx was created to help people earn crypto while buying things or doing tasks ( in the past old token was working that way ) and they are pretty successful at it .",

ETH I have a balance of 0.00000555 due to dust (basically nothing), and what you'd expect from just transfering out of an ETH wallet; this is a real technical limitation.

Binance needs to show the fees in whatever fiat one chooses: For example: Mine is USD. Show USD fee amounts when any transaction is being made not an 8 digit decimal on an asset which is fluctuating constantly! (Coinbase does that it helps tremendously) Show that fiat on the trades history page in a column so one can see by transaction the total fees.\n\nThere is only one reason NOT to do this: Baffle the consumer with BS and make more fees. Binance relies on it being just a BIT too complicated, time consuming and confusing for millions of trades. Customers just hit the buy button instead.\n\nOh I know we all should just be better at math, decimals, fractions, keep a calculator handy, extra browser tabs so we can instantly calculate hundreds of different currencies which are changing hundreds of times a day and each currency has its own fee.\n\nTransparency is key. It should be obvious, visible and as simple as possible.\nBinance does that and they will retain customers over time. If they DO NOT then customers will leave. ",

Imagine holding 20+ alts on binance and trying to get them out... If you only invested a relatively small amount in each alt then the fees are hitting you hard. \n\nMake the fee % based on the withdrawal amount with a minimum and maximum fee, i.e. minimum fee 1$, maximum fee 20$, inbetween 2.5% of withdrawal amount (just throwing around random numbers as an example). The current system is very unfair, it favors whales over small investors.\nAdditionally, please include an option to pay withdrawal fees in BNB.",

So open up an account with CEX.io (from memory they are UK based), deposit fiat to that exchange, buy something like DOT and transfer DOT to binance and you now have funds on Binance to trade however you wush! \n\nI've used Binance since 2017 and never bothered to get verified for fiat deposits. I've always on ramped fiat at a domestic exchange in my country then transferred crypto to Binance to fund my Binance accoun!  \n\nAll you have lost is the convenience of direct fiat deposits and added a few transfer fees..... if that's going to stop you from getting fiat invested in crypto..... then long term your only shooting yourself in the foot!  \n\nWe live in a DIGITAL world, investing in DIGITAL instruments (crypto) and can INSTANTLY transfer crypto anywhere in the world!

So say I want to put \u00a3100 into binance I bank transfer 102 gbp from bank to swissborg. I then exchange to xrp which costs 1.02 and then send to binance which is about 0.3. Then I will get \u00a3100.68 worth of xrp in binance and I can do what I want with it.\n\nWhen sending from swissborg to binance the fee will either be the small minimum send fee of xrp or it will be 0.1% of how much ur transferring, whichever is higher is what you will be charged.\n\nHope that helps, feel free to ask me stuff if u have any qs.",

Since we have 2 small kids, I'd use that money for diapers, formula etc. It was a nice extra for some expenses. Sadly, he passed away a while ago. While trying to get back on my feet and my and the kids life in order, I've thought about learning and trying my luck with crypto. Currently there's \u20ac1250 in the account, most on USDT, some on BNB and some on BTC. I'm working through all information provided like the academy on binance. My first real try was a lucky one, making \u20ac30 profit in a short time (with Enjin coin). Do you guys have any tips, tricks, what to look for if I want to make some small profits every now and then?",

What happens if you buy a token, set a sale price for 30$ higher on what you bought but it ends up dropping 300$? If you're just day trading things you dont really understand, it will be very hard and stressful to make a decision on whether to hold on to it or sell at a loss. I'd go with 1 of 2 options: find 1 or a few projects you understand and would like to invest in, dollar cost average in and leave it there long term, or find something with a guaranteed profit (like Binance savings, but you're typically looking at 5-6% annual return, which is much lower than what you're looking for). That being said, you're basically asking how your husband consistently made 9125$/year (assuming 25/day for 365 days) using 1000$ capital. That doesn't exist, its never consistent like that, else people with 100k in capital would turn into millionaires after 1 year of using this magic method. If the return is high, consider that the risk is just as high.",

If any of you are interested I use this terminal https://bittrade.one/ and I find the interface to be really great and self-explanatory, especially for beginners. Now, of course, that on cryptocurrencies that fluctuate a lot on a small scale this can be the best way to make some profit, but I'm interested in your opinion on two different situations.\n\nThe first would be in the case of currencies that have really big and sudden fluctuations, or even the ones that don't really fluctuate at all for a long period of time. Is it worth using such a strategy on them? Is there any way of decreasing the risk on them?\n\nThe second situation would be for cryptocurrencies that have really big downfalls followed by small increases, and then big booms. Wouldn't the strategy of \"buy and keep\" work better in such cases?\n\nI really hope my questions are not out of place and suited for the sub. Looking forward to your stories. I followed topics such as this one https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-cryptocurrency-for-scalping-now but the majority of them are old and dead, and with the sudden changes that can take place in this field, trusting threads from three years ago is definitely not the best way to choose what to invest in.

I'd probably avoid SMS based 2FA, since you would have no way to move your funds if you were vacationing overseas on a foreign cell network when things go lunar.\n\nAt a minimum, get a password manager to store it all, and make the password something like your SSN so your wife or whoever can get to your funds if you bang your head surfing.\n\nIf you (correctly) think your SSN is not a good password, then create a cryptographically random password then store it with a steel punch on sheet metal, encase it in lacquer and bury it beneath the oak tree that you proposed to your wife under.\n\nPoint is... make sure that every lock you make can be unmade by your next of kin in the case of the zombie apocalypse.

If the problem still exist contact please contact our customer service team again\". I contacted the support once again and after an hour a human support agent attended to me checked my issue and said he would transfer me to a senior agent then left the chat. 7 hours later another human support came online and also replied replied the same way saying my issue will be transferred to a senior agent to look into the issue. This is 46 hours later and counting and I still haven't gotten any reply from the supposed senior agent and stopped from withdrawing my funds. This is very appalling service from supposed best cryptocurrency exchange in the world, for 4 days and still counting I have been delayed from conducting my business and lost money due to this delay.",

I experienced a little bit of lagg in the orderbooks, or maybe it was just in WTC because of the big volume idk, About WTC i'm a big fan of it and i love that it is availible on Binance. Now i kinda feel that binance is an exchange that gives young potential currencys the oppurtunity to grow along side Binance. Thats why i would like to know if more people are with me on this new undervalued project. It is called Elixir and it had a marketcap of 1.4 million at this moment. The amazing thing is, the volume. over 2.5 million in the last 24 hours on a exchange that doesnt even come close to the volume binance has.\n\nI really would like to know what you guys think!\n\n[Good Article](https://medium.com/@BurgINK/elixir-cryptocurrency-is-a-good-investment-here-is-why-c37d989e7f06)",

Recently (three weeks ago) they blocked without reason my P2P account where there were 120 dollars in the p2p wallet that they don't let me withdraw in any way.\n\nI contacted their support, they always promised to send me an email with \"instructions\" to restore my account, the email never arrived. More than two weeks passed since the main claim and I sent them messages every day. Nothing.\n\nThe support people could never give me a real reason why they came up with blocking my P2P account. In each transfer, I put payment vouchers and asked buyers for proof as well, within Paypal I used invoices without mentioning anything about cryptocurrencies or Binance. **There was not 1 failure.**\n\nI just lost my 120 dollars",

            "text": "Some of you have already heard of the SEC putting regulation in place that prohibits exchanges such as Bittrex to list cryptos that are classified as a security. For a crypto to be classified as a security, it needs to pass the 'Howey test' (please check google for an explanation). Cryptos that have similarities with stocks/bonds/ETFs (such as the ones paying dividends like NEO or representing an index like Iconomi) could be classified as a security.\n\nThis could turn out to be a huge problem for US-based exchanges such as Bittrex and Poloniex. Bittrex is already rejecting some cryptos (e.g. Bitquence) for this reason and Poloniex has stated that they will evaluate all coins and potentially delist the ones that might pose a regulation breach. Bitquence is applying at Binance to get listed there instead of Bittrex.\n\nForgive me for daydreaming, but I think this could turn out to be a major opportunity for the Binance exchange as it is China-based and internationally focussed. If more and more securities go to Binance instead of Bittrex/Poloniex, combined with the lower fee, I don't rule out Binance becoming the nr.1 exchange in the world quicker than we think. \n\nIs there someone who can confirm these thoughts, or someone with more knowledge of the regulatory environment and the SEC ruling? Would be much appreciated!",

            "text": " Strange though this might sound, the most interesting path of progress unfolds specifically for altcoins. On the one hand, they do not have extreme popularity and a five-digit dollar price, but on the other hand, they have the motivation to create new promising models and occupy various industry niches, largely due to the technical capabilities of their projects. Since the technology itself is still at a development stage, and Bitcoin has already taken its position as a \u201cdigital gold\u201d and an asset for long-term investments, several promising areas are still open for altcoins.\n\n1. **Digital currency market**. The ability to succeed in the market is feasible through the fast transactions and the block size with the validity of its growth. This direction is available for those projects that plan their development several steps forward and work on their engagement with other cryptocurrencies, exchanges, and the fiat economy. \n2. **Existing business models**. Cryptoplatfoms that are designed to meet new solutions for various industries. Here we are talking about a wide range of things such as personal data, smart contracts, dapps, the Internet of things, sharing economy, various social networks, etc.\n\nAltcoins\u2019 potential will eventually influence its price. According to many predictions, shortly we are in for the next altcoin season. With BTC dominance breaking above 60%, it certainly seems like the times are coming for altcoins to enjoy new highs. Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee agrees that the time of the altcoins could be almost upon us. Quoting crypto traveler \u2018Heidi\u2019, Lee concurred;\n\n*\u201cThis ALT season reminds me of the early days of the 2017 bull. Some will pop, some will stay quiet until they don\u2019t. However, I am now seeing a lot of small caps exploding higher.\u201d*\n\nHere are a few more arguments by experts in this field regarding the prospects of altcoin:\n\n*\u201cBitcoin cranking up, but the real winners, beginning soon, pwill be the alt coins 10x + the rise in Bitcoin. Top of the heap will be the ones most beaten down in the Bear Market - Docademic, Apollo, XTZ, etc.\u201d, John McAfee, British-American computer programmer, and businessman.*\n\n*\u201cI can say with confidence that the altcoin season will begin together with the adoption of technology, it is the technology that will determine the future liquidity of the market of altcoins and the general vector of market development. The future season of altcoins won't cover the whole list of altcoins, it will be related to the coins that present definite value for the industry\u201d, Igor Chugunov, CEO at Credits*\n\n*\u201cIf Altcoins finally reach its season, it will be astronomical and I see where coins like DENT, HOLO CHAIN, NPXS, VET and BTT can jump 70x within 2 weeks due to whales pumping and dumping manipulation. While BAT, ENJ, THETA, ZILLIQA, QUARKCHAIN, CREDITS, AUGUR, RAVENCOIN, MIOTA, BNB, etc. would multiple over 50x within 2 weeks\u201d, Michael Shore, Chief Operating Officer at Mayax Corporation Inc.*",

            "text": "Hello all.\n\nSo, I have been trading for about 5 months or so in cryptos. I have learned on my way, made some mistakes, made some good moves and, overall, got a bit of benefit. I have learned some lessons about trading the hard way, so I said... Let's share those with fellow crypto traders who are just starting in this world.\n\nIf you are an experienced crypto investor and would like to add or correct something to this article, please write it down in the comments below. I am not going to teach you a clear strategy to \"become rich\" or tell you in which projects to invest (that's up to you to research and decide). Mostly I'm going to give you some tips and advices.\n\nAnd the mandatory disclaimer: **I am not an investment advisor. Please do your own research and understand that cryptocurrency is a high risk investment.**\n\nThat said:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Understand that each time someone earns money, someone else has lost it.**\n\nWe all saw the news about some guy who became millionaire overnight with cryptos. Truth is, news very seldom will tell you about the hundreds of users who actually lost their funds. If you make a very good trade, buy low and sell high... Somewhere in the world there are some people who sold their cryptos to you at a low price, and some who bought your cryptos at a high price. \n\nThe opposite is also true: If you did invest poorly and sold at a loss, someone else in the world has bought and made a profit from you. The market view can make you forget that, in the end, there are millions of people and enterprises trying to get money from each other. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **NEVER invest a money you cannot afford to lose.**\n\nYou can lose every single penny you bet on a crypto. I invested on some projects just to lose over 85% of my capital. But that was some money I could afford to lose, my life has not been affected at all by it. You should do the same. And let me add something: **it is quite unlikely you will become rich with crypto**. Do not bet your life savings on this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Learn some technical analysis of the trading graphics**\n\nUnderstanding the price movements of any crypto can help you increase your chances of predicting what direction the price is going to take. It is not perfect, though, and cryptocurrencies are still highly volatile, but it will give you an edge when you trade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. I know I said that but... Cryptos are VERY volatile**\n\n Sometimes a single tweet can cause a huge spike in price, or can send a blockchain project to oblivion. Remember DogeCoin going to the moon a few months ago, just after Elon Musk tweeted about it?\n\nYeah, I did sell my doge a few hours before this happened. Biggest facepalm of my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. Recover your investment**\n\nAs a trader, try as best as you can to recover your initial investment. This has 2 objectives:   \nFirst: To ensure you don't loose your funds due to changes in the market. Once your investment is back to FIAT currency (or an stablecoin) it is very difficult they lose value.\n\nSecond: To have available funds to reinvest when the market allows you to do so.\n\nAdding to this, you may want to always keep some FIAT or stablecoin funds ready to trade. Opportunities may appear at any moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6. Do not be over-greedy**\n\nA friend of mine started trading mostly at the same time as me. He did go big on Shiba Inu and his funds went \"to the moon\" (over 20x benefits). He decided to HODL, expecting the price to keep going up... and lost a huge benefit. Of course, eventually, the price crashed down.\n\nI believe in most cases, an increase of value should be responded by selling at least a part of your cryptos to ensure you get some benefit. If you wait for the price to keep increasing, it is likely it will decrease and you will lose your opportunity... or maybe the funds you invested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7. Understand the market tends to fluctuate up and down**\n\nOne of my first investments was on Chiliz. Just after I bought, the price started to drop until I fell for the fear of loses and sold. \"Well, I assume I have lost 20% of my investment...\". \n\nYeah, you guessed it: Like two weeks later, Chiliz increased its value again and I would have been able to get some benefit from it had I not panic-sold. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**8. There are not risk free inversions**\n\nNo matter how good an investment looks, how good the investment or saving product  appears to be, etc. There is always a risk you will lose your funds or cryptos. And if you believe youjustfound a perfect formula... most likely you are missing the point. Go around and ask until you understand it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**9. Investigate the project associated to the coins you invest in**\n\nUnderstand what you are investing in. Some coins have no project at all (usually called \"shitcoins\" or \"memecoins\"). Some others have interesting projects behind, and some others look amazingly good for long-time HODLers. The project behind a crypto can guide you on your investment strategy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**10. Think in percentages, not in number of coins.**\n\nSome times, numbers in crypto and FIAT can be confusing. What does it mean to have earned 10 millions Shiba Inus? Is it a huge change that BTC went from $41k to $43.5k? Have I lost my life savings because ETH decreased to $2k? \n\nRephrase that in percentages. You have increased your Shiba Inus by a 30%. BTC increased its price by a 5%. ETH lost 30% of its value. Suddenly everything looks clearer. Do not get lost in huge numbers anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**11. A huge potential of benefits is ALWAYS tied to a high risk**\n\n\"Oh, look, this dual investment options gives me a 70% APY! That's amazing!\". Yeah, look again, pal, because it is quite likely that in the end you will lose more than you gain. Trust me on this. Understand that, whoever person or company posted this options is also trying to rip benefit out of his/her/its investments. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**12: Do not fall for the FOMO!**\n\nFOMO = \"Fear of missing out\". Typical noob mistake (which I have made as well): You see a crypto increasing as crazy, you buy it to go up with it... and shortly after the tendency shifts, price corrects and you find yourself loosing money. \n\nIf price of a coin is rapidly increasing, very likely it will fall just as fast. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**13: Do not fall for the FUD!**\n\nFUD= \"Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt\". As I said before, I feel for the FUD with Chiliz and sold in panic. Analize well your investments before you decide to buy or sell. Do you believe that coin will recover its value in due time? Do you believe this blockchain project will increase in the long run? \n\nAnalyze and make calculated decissions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**14. Make a plan!**\n\nYour investment plan should answer a few questions: How much money are you willing to risk in cryptos? Do you want to keep adding funds in time? How are you going to distribute them? \n\nPersonally, I dedicate a fix percentage of my salary to investments, and then divide those funds among the different options. \"So 5% goes for crypto A, 15% for crypto B, 10% for this investment option...\". As I said before, think in percentages.\n\nAnother point of your plan can be how are you going to react to price changes. It is easy to be taken by FOMO or FUD, we are emotional animals. A set of rules can help you make better decissions. For instance, your plan could be: \"If BTC increases by a 30%, I will sell 20% of my BTC\". Followed by: \"If BTC falls by 20%, I will buy BTC up to a 30% of my USDT holding\". \n\nThose are just examples. The plan is completely up to you and your circumpstances. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**15. Use a portfolio**\n\nIt is very difficult to follow benefits or loses when you have 20+ cryptos distributed in several exchanges and/or wallets. A crypto portfolio can help you greats on this. I do recommend Coinmarketcap's portfolio: It is great, simple to use and free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that's all what I can think about so far. Hope this is helpful. And remember to always do your own research before you invest.",

            "text": "1. Introduction\nBinance is an exchange company formed in 2017. If one may ask, is Binance just an exchange or a progressive crypto exchange? My answer is that Binance is not just a crypto exchange company but an 'engine' that drives crypto-currency adoption. How? My readers may ask. My answers will first start with a simple analogy of what is adoption. \n\nAdoption is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting of another, (usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents,) and in so doing, permanently transfers all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological parent or parents (Wikipedia,2018). In the sense of crypto-currency it is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting of another ( new idea or way or thing) and in so doing permanently transfers all rights and responsibility that belong to the old or normal way to the new way. Driving in the other hand is knowing how to operate the mechanisms which control the system (vehicle); it requires knowing how to apply the rules of the road (which ensures safe and efficient sharing with other users). An effective driver also has an intuitive understanding of the basics of system (vehicle ) handling and can drive responsibly (Jacob,2018).  A driver may be a person, company, a system or device that knows the mechanism which control a system and the driver must formulate or know the rules and the basics of directing the system to its target. A device driver for instance is a system (computer program) that operates or controls a particular type of device (EMC,2010). In our case we are looking at crypto-adoption driver, a person or company that knows the mechanism which can be used to make greater number of people to transfer permanently the rights and responsibility of fiat money to blockchain currency (Crypto-currency). \n\nA clear case of driving adoption can be easily seen in Football which have been in existence long ago, but FIFA devices a way to entice all nation to participate and develop football infrastructure in there countries by moving Football tournament hosting around different regions and other things they did to make the sports to be popular (adopted) all over the regions of the world.      \n\nSimilarly, crypto-currency have been there before Binance started, crypto-exchanges have been there before the advent of Binance but what Binance did and what they did not do helped in replicating adoption across all the regions of the globe. The only challenge here is whether these position can be substantiated?\n\n2. The Authors experience\nMy name is Bartholomew Eke (PhD), a Software Engineer and Senior Lecturer at the University of Port Harcourt, Nigeria, Africa. I developed interest on cryptocurrency in 2010 after reading Nakamoto published paper Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer electronic cash system (Satoshi,2008) which I saw as a research on cryptography protection of online payments. I didn't well understood it until on Febuary 2014 on hearing that Mt. Gox the largest Bitcoin exchange tend, had gone bankcrupt and had made away with depositors 'Coins'. The word coins attracted my interest, I wondererd why they should be keeping the Coins instead of the notes, but I latter learnt it was not Coins but Bitcoins. Before that time Satoshis's Bitcoin was simply viewed by me as a research exercise aimed at improving crryptography which I had many programs on. The research on tracking of Mt. Gox Bitcoin in the publication of Sarah et. al (2016) increased my interest in Crypto-currency and exchanges research. The research is still ungoing though I have published some of my findings but one of my crushial discovery is that Binance is not just a cryptocurrency exchange but a driver of cryptocurrency and blockchain adoption. I am one of the few people trading in crypto exchanges as part of my research project so it often does not matter whether I gained a trade or lost provided I made my findings. I have used more than 15 exchanges only on experimental bases some of which include Coinbase, Blockchain, Kraken, Bitrrex, Tradesatoshi, Binance, Kucoin, Bit-Z, Cryptopia, Luno, Abucoin and Cryptagio just to mention a few. My criteria of registering include Low volume, High Volume, Low fee, High Fee, difficulty of registration, exchange incentive, exchange policy, cardinal goal of exchange, Fiat or non-fiat, age of exchange and other criteria which I will still publish in my future paper. I have lost and gained crypto in the process of the research but I saw some things that Binance does differently which may or may not have contributed to surge in users interest. \n3. Binance Key Drivers \nIn discussing the story of a young exchange called Binance there are some findings worth mentioning and they include:\ni) Segregation (Discrimination) : In all the money transfer companies and exchanges I have studied before the advent of Binance there is serious segregation among its customers. In some exchanges this differentiation is very scaring but in Binance it is very minimal, unnoticeable and almost non existent. I will use three experiences to explain, in Coinbase my country (Nigeria) can not trade but they can deposit and withdraw crypto, so why allow them to register only to segregate. Most exchanges, majority of users do not withraw more than 1BTC per day but exchanges group them into three level of users which have different withdrawal limits ( which is very OK for some reasons) but many exchanges go further to place trade restrictions based on this segregations. For instance Cryptopia do not allow you to trade USDT or its equivalent if you are not in certain levels. Bit-z will not allow you to participate in some trading competition or even get airdrops if you are not in some category of user. There are more instances but you will not experience any difference as a user until you want to withdraw above certain limits in Binance. Binance operates little or no discrimination allowing 'Private Crypto' users to remain in level 1 and operate freely provided they withraw smaller amounts. There are many world micro scale and unbanked users who can not afford to get any valid government ID for level 3 registration- Binance is were they fill welcomed. I spent some months as level 1 client and now am in level 2 but my withrawal is hardly upto one BTC a day so I feel no difference but that's not true with many exchanges.\nii) Incentives: The unprecidented incentives that Binance offer can make some body with zero dollar to be a marchant with Binance. In November 2017, I told my research students who do not have funds to complete their research work, to register in Binance and generate money to finish their research; they did and are about to graduate. Binance empowered them, they simply registered, got some Airdrops from some new crypto companies, sold and traded with the money and where given trading bonuses and they sold the coins and paid for there research costs via Binance. Their trading incentive vary so much that all kinds of traders benefit, to be more concrete Ontology had a condition of trading 0.5BTC over a week. Using $100 a trader can easily trade five times a day which is $1000 buy-sell volume, in five days that is $5000 volume above 0.5BTC at that time and they gave 1000 ONT which was worth (at some time) $10000, what else is incentive or empowerment. No one can deny these facts. Some new exchanges have copied these model which is great for cryptocurrency adoption. All young school leavers in my area are into Airdrop due to this model introduced by Binance.\niii) Low trading Fee : Binance is a cryptocurrency which is accepted for transaction in my local domain thanks to the exchange, for the past six months IT training centers in my locality accept and use Binance as payment for IT training. Trading fee is half when the coin is used to pay for fees but due to its relative stability Binance have found usage in other payments. Beginners can easily learn trading at reduced cost due to low fees. Majority of crypto traders in Binance are startup traders who are learning fast due to trading incentives.        \niv) High Volume: One of the Support team in Abucoin said that people go to Binance because of there high trading volumes, many people still have the same opinion. But as an academics I know that at a time Binance traded less than 1BTC during their starting stage either as one second or one minute trade volume, they did not start the first second of opening trade with large volumes. BTC only have less than 40% of all Crypto (Coinmarketcap,2018) and Binance introduce good altcoins which was followed by volumes. I was told when Binance started by a forum friend that an exchange that does not offer fiat currency will not attract traders but I differed, insisting that a trader will always prefer to make money in 'Aghanistan and spend it in Paris'. If a trader can ingage in quality trade in an exchange he will only go to the next exchange for cash-out. Cashing out is not always a problem once there is another exchange that is ready to exchange even a single crypto like Bitcoin or even TUSD or USDT. \nv) Honesty: Binance is an honest exchange, they promise they will distribute prices for trade in a given time you will get it before the time or right at the time they promised. Some exchanges do not add crypto handling delays when they make promise only to discover that a transfer may take 30 seconds today and 3 days the next hour. Binance will tell you two weeks after trading competition the coins will be distributed, they do not usually mean it. What they actually said is that \"in two days time after context we will send the winners there coins and the coins can take at most 10 days to reach\". In most cases the coins reach in seconds instead of the added days they promised. Cryptocurrency is scary and new users are afraid of dealing with faceless customer service personnels, emails and text messages. What they always want is \"your coin is confirming 1/30 confirmations\"; they can go to sleep believing that in 5days the coin will be their own. Binance delivers on promises. When they found abnormality that will make customers loss they will raise alarm. For instance during Bytecoin surden price spike in early May 2018 they warned customers to trade with cursion explaining that coin deposit problem may have caused price abnormality-honesty. They constantly remind you to trade with their Binance coin for low fee even when they know that your failure to do that results to higher fees and more gain to the company but they prefer to honestly warn customers.\nv) Selection of Promising Alt Coins: \nI am a lecturer in Africa and have never worked with any crypto company but I have traded more than 15 coins in Binance (the evidence is the piece of coin left) but the coins are promising. The coin that is usually at the bottom of the Binance volume is Via Coin which is still a good coin (from my accessment). Most of the coins listed in the exchange easily move up creating great choice and selection space for traders. When crypto exchange grow, users grow and trading space need to grow, Binance is master in that strategy. If a company produces a fake coin or even a 'good coin' with bad road map they will not even approach Binance for listing for two reasons- fear of not spending their money since they do not have plans to make more money from long term plan, fear that there listing request will be rejected. The choice of coins cut across prices and different rating in Coinmarketcap; Binance does not wait for a coin to be in the first 100 before listing them rather if they believe the coin is promising they select the coin.     \nvi) Recognition of developer community\nAny IT company today that do not take care of its developers or technical teams well will loose them to other cryptocurrency companies and there are many of them coming up. Exchanges seem to believe that there job is to deal on other peoples products but Binance has shown that the best we to understand the crypto world is by been one with it. Binance is not just an exchange, it is a cryptocurrency, a blockchain technology and security and software development organization. This is correct but that can not be said of many exchanges except those copying Binance model. Surprisingly those exchanges copying Binance are also getting visible result. \nvii) Efficiency and Speed of Site and Trading App.\nThere are things that the Western countries take for granted- power availability and very high speed internet connectivity. Readers of this story from advanced nations should jump to the next point. But the rest of the world have little power which is not even available always and internet cost are high and speed are extremely low. Even when the provider have technology to provide high speed users prefer to have their data last for one full month than to see it finished due to high speed usage. Some times provider intentionally slow down  speed to avoid customers outcry of quick  finishing data. This calls for exchanges to carry majority of users along in developing there trading platforms. The faster the better and Binance is acting and continues to work on this. \nviii) Security\nThis is closely related to technology since internally trading apps needed to be upgraded to remain ahead of hackers, crakers and phishing organisations.  Early in the year 2018 Binance had a phishing attack, we could easily imagine the state of the cryptocurrency exchange now is they had suceeded. But the phishers could not still coins even when they have broken in, this increased users confidence in the exchange and draw more new clients. The new features added to the exchange have even made email phishing extremely difficult to phishers. There are other security features added which users can sence but are hidden to public discussion. \nix) Rich \nBinance is a rich company, rich in their attitude to the world community, rich in income generation, rich in the way they give to start up companies even when they are also start up themselves, rich in their logo and rich in communicating with customers. Rich in innovative ideas. Binance is rich. Poverty repels, so Binance will keep attracting every body to itself. \nx) Binance is blessed with an experienced and humble CEO\nWhen a company has an experienced leader the multiplier effect is seeing on the rest of the staff. Innovative staff will have little headache in getting their ideas approved. An arrogant leader is a liability to a company and make the company to keep regreting its actions. The leader is planning to go to Malta but he is still insisting that it is just a branch of Binance making the current host the consider its stands on tough regulation. \n\n4. Binance Road Pot Holes\nA driver must be careful about pot holes else his good car may tumble. Binance no dought now is really a cryptocurrency innovation adoption driver and must watch out for the following.\ni) Rise of Communities around cryptos\nCommunities grow a company and communities make companies to go down. If all traders pull out from Binance the company will be history. When Bitcoin started, there was one cryptocurrency community, one group of Bitcoin developers, one Bitcoin enthusiast,  but today that is far from the reality. We now have many Bitcoin communities (BTC, BCH, BTCP, BTG etc) and many altcoin communities. Passion have started to roll in these communities and support is continously solicited and soon tougher competitions will ensure the coin to list need to be voted for and a new way for paying for coin listing should be deviced  using Binance Coin to vote.\nii) Ico Support\nBinance supports ICOs but for more than three months there LaunchPad on their website have being showing Bread and Gifto, this is very bad. When not launching a coin the LaunchPad need to be empty and when new coin are not coming to the Binance LaunchPad the LaunchPad should go to new coins. Binance community can vote to select the next coin that will go into the LaunchPad. If it required payment then they can use their binance coin to vote and get rewarded by the new coin in a form of shared bounty or airdrop. \niii) Strong Community\nWe have discussed the rise of communities, binance is lacking on strong community (a group that have strong passion for Binance as an Exchange, a Cryptocurrency and as a Technology). A community driven by volunteers and not by Binance employee, a community that will work for the passion and not for duty. I see three Binance and the group must be very passionate about the three. This may not be group of Binance Traders - no they are too busy and have no coin or exchange friend. Binance may be working towards this direction in the Binance Angels project but wisdom must be used to get the correct arrow head of the community and  to actually let go of the person to freely handle the community. If the staff want to lord it on the community followership will be for duty not for the passion.\niv) Binance Bounties\nBinance have so many trading bounties won after the competitions. This is good but part of this bounties need to be used to bring in more new users who will register and a buy Binance and smaller amount for new members without any conditions. The trade competitions the way most of them are ends up in the hands of already suceessful members who can trade once a day and win the competition due to there financial musle. These group of big traders are highly desirable and will continue to remain in the first to third places. But future members need to be attracted with the little tokens falling out from every bounty.\nv) Need for Binance_Inc Exchange\nBinance is so big and will get bigger. Binance need to have another cryptocurrency exchange, but instead of just an exchange Binance should have an incubator exchange. 'Division Two exchange' this exchange will be low volume and should serve as a source for listing in the main exchange. If a coin is performing with high volume it can be moved to the main exchange. In a crypto in the main exchange is not performing in they can be moved back to the incubator exchange. In this way Binance will remain the technology and develop in other areas. \n\n5.  Binance as an Innovative Crypto-currency Adoption Driver \nIt has been said that adoption is the original dependent variable in innovation research and the desirable property of innovative systems which change agents seek to enhance. \"Innovation\" on the other hand is any change in structure, design, products, or processes in which there is a definable new element introduced into the system; the process is essentially the same for all technologies including blockchain technologies. In innovative space the characteristics of people or organizations are associated with higher levels of adoption and the company that makes the adoption to happen faster is very innovative. The voiced or unvoiced assumption underlying the examination of correlates of innovativeness is causal: If we manipulate the characteristics of organizations or individuals so that they more closely resemble those of the highly innovative, we will make the organizations or individuals themselves more innovative (Eveland, 1979)\n\nConclusion\nIt is very easy to conclude this article by saying that since Binance was able to make more people to adopt cryptocurrency in a fast manner that they are not only drivers of cryptocurrency adoption but they are Innovative. Ask of an innovative cryptocurrency exchange the response should be Binance, when they move others copy so without the statistics of their trade volumes one can easily see that they are truely the leaders that the crypto exchange space have today.\n\nReferences\nEveland J.

            "text": "Hello all\n\nI am a long time crypto supporter and I wanted to post this to show the problem with customer service from what I understand to be the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world.\n\nI am not a techie, I am an average guy who supports the goal of many different cryptocurrencies. I definitely see a lot of coins like XRP, XLM, BAT, ADA playing a big role in our future.\n\nHowever, for this to happen, I do think it has to be easy for the average person to access. Customer service is paramount.\n\nLong story short, I sent some coins from kraken to Binance. 900 XLM. I made a mistake. I forgot the memo. My bad.\n\nThis was a week ago. I sent Binance about 20 emails back and forth since then. I have had 5 carbon copy emails that look like they are written in greek to a non techie talking about searching btc, etc etc.\n\nFinally talked to a real person. Told me to open a ticket. I went into my binance account, opened a ticket, went into my kraken account copied the transaction I'd, memo I'd, time of transaction. Sent it with all info included.\n\nAfter all this I thought MY coins would finally be back. Nope, today I get this from support. \n\nCS \u00a0(Binance)\nDec 2, time CST\n\nHello,\n\nThanks for your inquiry.\n\nTo handle your issue, please confirm that your account has passed level 2 verification first. We do not handle this issue for accounts under level 2.\u00a0\n\nAlso, please kindly provide the information listed below:\n1. Your email address of Binance account,\n2. TxID/transaction ID/Tx Hash\n3. A video of the withdrawal record from the source wallet or exchange.\n\nThe video needs to meet below requirements:\na) You must appear in the video.\u00a0\nb) Please make sure the video shows your whole login process from the sender platform, website URL, and withdrawal records like transaction ID or hash and date. if you are using stargazer wallets, nano ledger or any other personal wallets, please show us the wallet address or public key in addition with Transaction details like Hash or TX ID.\u00a0\n\nThe video size should not exceed 20 MB if you wish to submit an attachment in the ticket. You can also upload your video to your private confidential drive and provide us the available link to watch or download your video.\n\nPlease be noted that we are not able to proceed with your request if any of the mentioned details above are missing. Please make sure you have provided all information as required. We will check and credit your funds as soon as possible if all details are confirmed.\u00a0\n\nThank you for the cooperation and looking forward to your reply.\n\nBest Regards,\nBinance Support Team\n\n\nI have to take a video now of the transaction with me in it cause I forgot to put a memo in it? I'm so confused, I made a mistake but this seems crazy. \n\nCan anyone here advise. Should I do it. I'm tempted to take my coins I own and just leave. \n\nIf you want mass adoption by average people you cant ask them to jump through this many hoops for an error.\n\n\n",

If you make a mistake with a bank transfer, the bank can usually fix it. In crypto, you are the one responsible. \n\nThe reason why Binance requests this, is explained by /u/buttcoindeluxe (I assume they are right, I don't know about XLM)\n\nEssentially what you did is sending a transfer to the right bank but wrong person. The \"bank\" (crypto chain) took your transfer and instantly fulfilled it without any chance to do anything. Now your money is in the other \"bank\", but that bank does not know who those funds belong to.\n\nAs for a solution, do you have access to a computer you could use to login to film with your phone? Otherwise, you will probably need to get a second phone (or a camera, most modern ones can take video) to take the video.",

What if I've verified my account through taking a selfie (intermediate verification) and didn't complete the (advanced verification) so they don't know where am I located exactly + using a vpn? (they may, if they check out the selfie Pic where the province appeared in the driver license)\nI've talked to their support team and they told me that we don't know whether you are from Ontario or not, so you can continue using our services, which is somehow weird (how the hell they don't know where am I located when it's obvious from the driver's license?)\n\n2. They told me that I can continue using their services even after 31 December. Now the question is what will happen after 31 December if I don't take any actions? Will they stop services like withdrawal or just trading features? (in the event of a bad luck when they find out where am I located)\n\n3. I asked them about the tax issues, they told me that they will never share their users information with any other companies nor government or any organization. So should I be worried about the tax issues? I mean, should I report my trades, balance and the other things for tax purposes? I've read that all trading activities including buying, selling or exchanging a cryptocurrency to another cryptocurrency would be a taxable event. So what will happen if I don't report my trading activities for tax purposes? (I don't plan to withdraw or deposit any fiat, I just used crypto to deposit and I just withdraw crypto to my wallets.)\nHow will they know what did I do on binance? Do they ask binance for Ontario-based users information? Will binance give them what they want? What's the risks here?\n\n4. I'm thinking of moving my assets to a cold wallet and then use dexes (decentralized exchanges) for trading. I think it's the best possible way to stay away from the risks both on binance side and the government (CRA). But, well, there are no functionalities like stop-limit orders, or limit buy-sell orders there. We can simply buy an asset at the very immediate price.\nWhat's your idea about this? Do you think that it's a good way to be safe around?",

            "text": "Hey guys,\nIf you haven\u2019t noticed on Binance\u2019s monthly community voting round \u2013 it has been a tight battle but Substratum has been taking the lead.\n\nI wanted to explain why Substratum has seemingly come out of no-where but has garnered some attention. Substratum is creating a solution to a very big obstacle in the world web. The below has been taken from Justin Tabb aka the Founder of Substratum and summarises what the purpose of the network is.\n\nI hope you guys can support their vision by voting for Substratum (SUB) on the https://www.binance.com/vote.html.\n\n\nThe Substratum Network will bring the decentralized web worldwide without the need of special software for the average internet user. We will be able to serve Substratum Requests directly to the default browser (Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer) without any special software installed on the average consuming users computer.\n\n\nHow Substratum Works\n\nEase of Use: currently nearly everything that has to do with crypto or the blockchain is very difficult to use and requires technical knowledge. Through our 10+ years of experience working with companies like Apple we understand the importance of a good user experience.\n\n\u2022 The average internet user requires NO special software to use the Substratum Network. The default browser will service all requests for average users so they do not need to do ANYTHING different. Users who wish to service requests and receive SUB coins in return will have a point and click user interface that any user can setup. No technical knowledge required. SubstratumPay will be seamlessly integrated and geared towards high conversions of low technical expertise users. \u2022\nServing Up of Decentralized Content: Substratum provides a method for serving Decentralized Content (including Web Sites, Data, and Applications) through a Mac, Windows, and Linux application/service that is easy to install and run (requires no technical expertise) and serves up decentralized content using the toolkit that we have developed.  This is a point and click process and requires zero technical knowledge.  All the user has to do is install the application, click through a few settings and they are up and running and making Substratum Coin.\nIncentivizing Users to Serve the Content: in order to incentivize users to run the Substratum Network client on their machine we will be providing Substratum Coin to them for doing so. The coin is issued to the serving machine through a micro-transaction from the hosting site to the serving computer. By breaking fees down to a micro-transaction level this will greatly reduce the overall cost to companies and entities that want to host sites and applications on the internet solving yet another problem with the web as it stands today.\n\nPrivacy / Security / Encryption: by allowing millions of Substratum Network users to serve content the biggest concern becomes privacy and security. Substratum solves these issues through advanced cryptography algorithms rooted in Artificial Intelligence that ensures all data remains secure. Following the lead of BitCoin this is the strength of cryptocurrency and the crypto movement.\nStorage and Serving of Content: in order to serve millions of sites, databases, and applications the Substratum Network employs custom developed advanced compression algorithms and machine learning to geolocate the right Substratum Network machine to serve up the content to the appropriate user based on geolocation, this will ensure the fastest load time with the lowest amount of latency and strain on the Substratum Network and both the serving and receiving machine.\nDNS (Domain Name System): DNS or the Domain Name System is the system that currently tells your browser where to go when you type in a domain name. For instance when you go to Chrome and type in apple.com a DNS lookup is performed to check where to send that request, the DNS system comes back with an IP address and your request is routed there. In the first version of SubstratumDNS will be a complex, AI enabled DNS server that will receive DNS requests along with the geolocation of the requestor and find based off of that information the closest available SubstratumNode that is able to fulfill the request. Development Tools for the Decentralized Web: the Substratum Network will provide an API and SDK for developing tools on the Substratum Platform. This will bring in strong developer support and will accelerate the growth of the decentralized web on the Substratum Network.\nNet Neutrality: with the Substratum Network ALL web-sites and applications will have EQUAL ability to be broadcast in an equal and fair manner.\n\nInternational Digital Barriers: currently countries like China have strict regulations on what their 1.379 billion citizens are able to interact with on the internet. Substratum will break down these barriers through a network of decentralized computers running the Substratum Network Software. Where other solutions that are currently used by residents in these countries require special software to be installed, like TOR, Substratum will take a reverse approach and require no special software for the average user.\n\nHigh Hosting Costs: currently businesses must pay high hosting fees to get their web-sites on the internet. Amazon Web Services launched a 3.5BIL USD per year business by attempting to solve this problem. They allow you to pay for how many minutes you run a web / database server. Substratum completely solves this problem through the power of cryptocurrency by only charging for each request that is processed. You can check out the website here: \u2022 Substratum.net o And the whitepaper is available in multiple languages inclusive of Mandarin.\n\nFurthermore, Substratum and the founders are very active in the slack \u2013 which they have recently hosted an AMA (ask me anything); I took the liberty of getting this information and if you are interested about the project to read more into it. Obviously they can\u2019t reveal the inner workings of their product due to product sensitivity and being ahead of their competition but they are always up to date with the community through several videos on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxUJoTH0XLERKl55zGnFI6g) and announcements through their social media. I recommend you follow them. \n\nQ: Any major talks with exchanges yet?\n A: We just announced that we are launching on our FIRST official exchange of COSS.IO on 9/30 trading against BTC and ETH. More to follow. \n\nQ: Will I be able to run a supernode? \nA: From the beginning NO. Supernodes will only be for Substratum; however, they will run the SAME software that are used to run a NODE. In time we will develop a requirement list to run a supernode. If you qualify you can then run a SuperNode and receive a premium payout\n\nQ: Is it possible to show a few examples of SUB payouts you get from running a node, and the tell us the ratios that affect the amount/way to calculate it somehow? (SUB owned, for how long you've been running a node etc..) Or is that still in testing? What's the difference in node rewards from someone who has 0 SUB's as opposed to someone who has X amount of SUB's?\n A: So the calculations for this are in process; however, you can watch our video \"How Substrate Per Request Is Calculated\" on our YouTube channel for an idea of what variables go into each calculation\n\nQ: How do we prevent DDoS? \nA: The first step is not talking about how we prevent DDoS or any other hack. We call that security through obscurity. :slightly_smiling_face: Secondly, one of the primary ways to prevent a DDoS attack is decentralization. Well that's perfect. Lastly, there are other techniques, like black-holing and basically shutting a node down. The great news is that we will be decentralized so we are only talking about a node or specific IP Address that will not disrupt the network. :thumbsup:\n\nQ: Say i got a website i want to publish on Substratum, how does this process go?\n A: Just a shout out if you ask for a lot of detail regarding technology stack and how exactly something will work we are most likely going to give you general answers. This is not to skirt the question. We want to be 10 steps ahead of anyone with nefarious plans before we get launched. You will be seeing more on this very soon. You should be seeing a video drop on this in the next week or two. The goal is to make this easy to use and powerful, plus empower others to use the tools. We're looking at things to different ways one is towards the average user who just want something sitting on their system and doesn't need any more details and the other is a super user who wants a lot of configuration options.\n\nQ: When more people will use Substratum and more will run nodes, the value of SUB will increase. How will it be calculated how much SUB you get as a reward for running a node as value increases? Will it be calculated by Substratum itself or will it be changed manually every so often? \nA: We will be calculating against the live value of Substratum\n\nQ: Is substratum detectable, for example if it\u2019s used in a country like china and they are caught on these sites that are blocked by government\u2026 Can it be detected? \nA: The goal is to make it constantly moving. We do not want it to be. fast, easy, powerful, anonymous.\n\nQ: Will there be Master Nodes? \nA: We will have some services that are available that will help provision nodes into the network. We are still story mapping this flow and architecture.\n\nQ: Could we get more information about what you require to do to be a beta tester?\n A: To be a beta tester you only need to add yourself to the #beta-tester channel here in Slack. You will be notified when we are ready for you to download and install and the process and requirements to continue to run the software\n\nQ: Will you keep us informed on a at least weekly base to tell/ show us the progress made? \nA: Yes! We will continue to drop at least 2 professionally made update videos each week (with Jason Burns the guy who does them) and we will be doing more and more candid videos\n\nQ: Who is the winner of 10k subs and what idea did he give? And what about 2nd place and 3rd place. \nA: To be announced shortly. The Substrate is reserved for the payout\n\nQ: Can we mine Sub without the software? \nA: I will personally be selling pick-axes on my personal website \"pixaxesforsale.biz\" for a low cost of $19.99\n\nQ: Unless they disclose intelligent life in space, people are still going to be mad at the end of this. A lot more will be happy though \nA: Haven't found intelligent life in space. Some would question finding it on earth.\n\nQ: From a legal stand point How are we protected if someone is running illegal content on our Node? \nA: Take a look at our video of \"How Substratum Secures Your Site Content\". You will never hold the entire piece of data except perhaps in memory if you are the one serving the request so you could never be culpable. Amazon isn't held responsible if I host illegal content now\n\nQ: What about content control? child porno .. and so on ... ? Is there anything to control the content or? \nA: Excellent question. This was a big concern for us. We do not want Substratum to become the dark web. The goal is to allow the community to self-govern, vote up and down, call out illegal activity. The utilities will allow those with bad intentions to be called out. The more we grow the better we will be about wiping out things like child porn, and just as bad human trafficking.\n\nQ: When will the raised money going to be donated? \nA: We have already donated $10K out and we have a pending wire for $40K going out Monday. We are working to find the BEST places with the IMMEDIATE needs.\n\nQ: When will the livestream of the burn be? \nA: Burn #1 will be a livestream of my computer screen later tonight. I will announce on twitter at least an hour ahead of time and we will record it so people can see it later\n\nQ: What will the final circulating supply be after all three token burns? \nA: We are still getting a FINAL number on this, we are still doing some FINAL Bonus sends but we will have the number VERY VERY soon and we will be posting it. We will be burning 60MIL tokens tonight so that should give you some kind of an idea.\n\nQ: can you stop slack from freezing my firefox? \nA: Use the downloadable app, or get better internet, or get a new computer. Sounds like a dumpster fire.\n\nQ: Everyone brings up the obvious choice of child porno that needs to be dealt with via content control. What about grayzones such as weed-selling sites? Its illegal in some countries, some not. How will Substratum deal with these grey-zones? \nA: Give me liberty or give me death.\n\nQ: Could i have an invite to beta test channel on slack? \nA: Yes, just let a moderator know.\n\nQ: could i get more information on what beta testers are required to do? I will happily be one if it helps the process and I actually manage to do it. \nA: Join the #beta-testers channel here\n\nQ: when will we see a new homepage? \nA: This is being worked on now!\n\nQ: is there a minimum amount of SUB needed to run a node? \nA: NO! 0 Substrate, don't worry, you will have some soon once you turn it on\n\nQ: What about running an \"micronode\" on any phone (there is a big % using phones all the time), I mean an app installed on phone to run a node and to host only small content like a photos... Did you think about of this? \nA: https://youtu.be/h6tZ_ZFuFmY\n\nQ: What if my website ethically and morally right and people downvote it out of jealousy will my website be removed if there are more number of downvotes and my content is clean? \nA: The process is NOT that simple, we will release more details later but this is being taken into consideration. I answered in a bit more detail above as well\n\nQ: Does the Sub team ever sleep ? \nA: Only when driving\n\nQ: Can I run a node on a VPS? \nA: I certainly won't be telling people how or where to run the node software. Do the best you can. I actually answered the VPS question above too. We will have a command line version if that is the question. That you can run on something like Ubuntu Server if you want\n\nQ: Can the voting system for all illegal stuff on the internet also be used in a 'bad' way on the regular websites to for example gain commercial/business advantages? \nA: It should not, no one will have 'master control' All control, so the market decides always.\n\nQ: Who will profit from cryptopay? How will this bring value to SUB tokens? \nA: Everyone will as we gain dominance. But also, Substratum the company will take a small percentage. This will enable us to continue building awesome apps. CryptoPay will be the cornerstone of many good things to come. Think retail, goods and services.\n\nQ: I work at a games company with 200+ high powered pcs. If I install sub nodes on every single one of them at night, will IT be able to catch and fire me \nA: See your HR manual, or HR supervisor for those questions.\n\nQ: How do websites and hosters remain protected from hacking, if sites are created with innate vulnerabilities does that expose other sites hosted by the same node? \nA: This is a great question. Hosting Nodes will have to vet out their security. Again, being decentralized goes a long way in providing security. So does encryption. We will help hosts be the best hosts possible.\n\nQ: Please explain the earning in SUB by running a node? \nA: So the SUB comes FROM the HOST (who purchases the SUB) to the NODE for the cost of the transaction. https://youtu.be/LWZ1DIGGOoQ\n\nQ: When will the tokens be sent for the 100 Sub giveaway \nA: Shortly\n\nQ: How will Substratum market themselves towards countries that needs SUB the most but are hard to reach, such as North Korea, Africa, China? \nA: Think spider web. The more that join, and use, the less it can be controlled.\n\nQ: How long will this bear market last for? \nA: Let me put the fortune teller hat on. Crypto is a young demographic currently. It will be bear'ish until we make the technology easier and they get older.",

This is the danger of those \"Keep me Logged-in\" checkboxes.\n\nAs a general rule, one should always:\n1. Avoid extended session tokens by avoiding \"Keep me logged-in\" checkboxes.\n2. Always physically log out to force existing session tokens to expire.\n3. Ensure that 2FA is required and cannot be bypassed for funds transfer.\n\nBeyond this, avoid SMS based 2FA.  SMS is fairly trivial to hijack.  Authenticators should always be used, so long as the user know how to backup their 16-digit 2FA guid to allow Authenticators to migrate, but even then, someone monitoring your laptop could easily scrap your 2FA guid, making 2FA pointless.\n\nBut as others have suggested, most of these type posts tend to have holes in them.",

Besides, someone even managed to make money on their investments into cryptocurrencies. So I thought maybe it\u2019s time to become one of them and follow trends and invest in cryptocurrencies. It is just a meme below, but I hope that everything will be fine if I start investing in something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zw2isy868n171.jpg?width=702&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc5d7cb49d6b80a7af69b85f1b5ddc292e3cb9dc\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost people are already aware of how lucky they got people who started mining bitcoins at the very beginning. No one actually believed that the value of bitcoin will grow that high. I even suspect that those people doubted bitcoins\u2019 success at that moment too. However, as a result, they\u2019ve got fortunate, and they became unbelievably wealthy when the price for one bitcoin reached 10K. After that, many people tried to invest in bitcoin, but they didn\u2019t make much money on them as the first group.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe current cryptocurrency market offers many new currencies where you can either try to invest your money or mine them by yourself and invest your time in it. But not everything ends up that well as the bitcoin story. I always read on different news portals about a new scam related to cryptocurrency investments. I don\u2019t think that any of view want to be a part of that story. That\u2019s why I started to look for different guidelines in this new world, and [https://www.gpucoin.net/](https://www.gpucoin.net/) is one of them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the one hand, we can invest in something trustworthy as a Bitcoin. But it requires way more initial capital. Besides, there is no guarantee that you can double the value of a Bitcoin. The price of 1 Bitcoin is fluctuating, and current traders are risking a lot. On the other hand, we can invest in something new on the market. Again, we need to be aware of the risk, making this harder for risk-averse people like me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, what would you prefer to do? Invest into something verified, or try the blue ocean?",

Along with those tokens the creators will hold online auctions where one can buy Pokemon using the Charizard Token (no other currencies will be useable). These Pokemon consist in the form of NFT's and these will be created for all original 151 Pokemon. Owners of these Pokemon will be able to fight against each other but also trade and buy or sell different types of Pokemon. Now that's sick.",

GameStonk is the latest Robinhood in the crypto room, with the new GameSwap DEX serving as the only exchange that restricts trade to corporations rather than small businesses. This is the UNO Reverse card, as the notorious Robinhood smartphone trading platform limited retail trading on GameStop to support hedge funds while damaging retail traders.

I have a green tick next to \"Advanced Verification\". I added my bank account under the \"P2P\" and \u201cWithdraw\u201d pages.\n\nI went to make a bank deposit in Binance and received the error, \"Your account is currently under review. Please try again after your verification has been approved\". Apparently according to support this is only supposed to take 2-3 hours. However for me it never changed until I put in numerous support requests.\n\nA few hours later I got not 1, but 4 emails saying \"High Risk Account Request Declined\": \"We're sorry to inform you that your request to increase the limit has been declined due to the high risk of your account: Based on our Terms of Service and internal policy, this payment method is currently not available to you. We deeply apologize for any inconvenience caused.\"\n\nSupport wouldn't tell me why, or give me any information. They led me to believe it was automated and suggested I close my account and try to open a new one. Apparently once a high risk rating is met it cannot be undone. They gave me a link to close my account. The Binance T&C say you can only have one account at once.\n\nSo I did just that. Closed my account, and opened a new one. My original email was now banned, so I had to create an alias at my domain.\n\nThe verification process took ages, and after chasing it up, they sent me 8 emails in the space of 2 minutes -\n\n> \"Application Declined\".\n\n> \"We're sorry to inform you that this payment method is currently not available to you, but you can still use our other services on .com. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.\"\n\nThe 9th email I received said:\n\n> Personal Verification Unsuccessful\n\n> We're sorry to inform you that your Personal Verification has been declined for the following reason(s):\n\n> \" We are unable to provide our service to you at this juncture based on our Terms of Use and internal policy. We deeply apologise for any inconvenience caused. \"\n\nI'm confused as to why I am not being permitted to buy any cryptocurrency from Binance.com. I wanted to do so with 0% fees, the third party options (BPay, etc) there have fees for purchases. I'm located in Australia and wanted to deal with Binance directly.\n\nI am confused as to why I am being refused, when I have never breached any of the terms and conditions. I am a new customer and I believe this is an error. I am unable to get a proper response from Customer Support.\n\n### Edit 1:\n\n It seems the second error I got with my new account, just failed on the \"Advanced Verification\" section. It now has a red \u274c and says \"We are unable to provide our service to you at this juncture based on our Terms of Use and internal policy. We deeply apologize for any inconvenience caused.\"\n\nWith the first account that was approved, but I got the other error about high risk. When I go to the Bank Deposit page, it gives me another opportunity to complete Identity Verification. That seems to be to increase the limit to 10000/day AUD. I was never planning on purchasing *that much* in one day, so that makes me question if I actually need Advanced Verification. It won't let me even add a card without doing it however.\n\n### Edit 2:\n\nI just had another look at my driver's license and it looks like it has expired this week. I better re-new that, and try again.",

The Chinese government banned ICOs and all ICO platforms in China are basically done but Binance is not full-fledge ICO platform and it's advantage as an exchange does not come from conducting ICOs but with it's technology to process massive amount of orders and very low fees. ICOs were just something extra for Binance. Plus Binance has responded very quickly to comply with the gov and refunded and/or stopped all ICOs. Thus, there is no real reason why Binance will be affected in scale by this regulation. Sure a bit since ICOs are no more but as I mentioned, the exchange still holds strong competitive advantage.  Furthermore, Chinese government already said that they are still in the blockchain game and will even be the leader in the cryptospace. This means chinese people will still have access to cryptocurrency and definitely the crypto-game is still on in China. So if the crypto itself is not affected, it means Binance as exchange is unaffected and still holds advantage in terms of tech and low fees. Furthermore, Binance has great team to handle this and recently received VC funding. Are VCs stupid? If Binance was really done, no institution will ever invest in them, especially strongly profit-motivated VCs. Hence my conclusion is that this is a great opportunity for people who believe in Binance. Personally, I really don't see the reason for the drop. Binance is still one of the fastest exchanges out there and although they lost approx 15% of their users but still this is temporary and with cheap fees, and great team more will come. This is exactly why this is an opportunity. People will realize this very soon and Binance will go TO DA MOON!!! Act fast to stack up guys! I do want to hear what you guy have to say about this tho.

            "text": "There's something I don't understand about Binance fee mechanism that not even a cs ticket I recently opened could clarify. \n\nCorrect me if I am wrong. We have two main cases on binance:\n\na) if you have enough BNB in your wallet, trading fees will be subtracted from there. Ok, I got it. This is simple.\n\nb) if you don't have enough BNB your trading fees are subtracted from SOMEWHERE and expressed in your base currency.\n\nNow, I simply would like to understand WHERE these fees are taken FROM and how the process of fees handling works.\n\nLet me give you a comparative example to explain me better:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou are on BITSTAMP and place a market order to buy btc for an amount of \u20ac250. FROM this quantity, the fee is immediately subtracted, and then the remainder is used for the order: the exchange will place an order to buy btc for an amount of \u20ac248.75. So you have:\n\n \n\n|order amount|fee amount (0.5%)|total|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|\u20ac248.75|\u20ac1.25|\u20ac250|\n\nOk. This is the process of handling the fee in BS, and it's very easy to understand. Fees are expressed in your quote currency and are subtracted from the original amount you enter. Ok.\n\nNow if I ask you to describe the same process on binance, what would you answer? (let me say once again, NOT in the case fees are paid with BNB)\n\nLet's have a look at this example from my order history reports:\n\n[binance-history](https://preview.redd.it/u5xpsfgr4s841.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6389ea79d94195880038f3eb640e2797b42200b)\n\nas you can see fee is expressed in base currency, but WHERE is it taken FROM?\n\n\\-is it subtracted from your ETH amount before the order (and if so, why not express it in eth instead of trx or bat?)\n\nsomeone states that [the fee is subtracted from the filled amount](https://smartphones.gadgethacks.com/how-to/binance-101-fees-fine-print-you-need-know-before-trading-bitcoins-other-cryptocurrencies-0182067/), as if the original amount was 310.31 and 0.31 were subtracted; but that doesn't seem to be the case, since each and every order I made reports a integer filled number: you never have something like xx.yy but always xx.\n\nSo my question is: can someone describe which is the process binance marketplace adopts to apply the fee in case you don't have enough BNB?\n\nas easily as I could be able to describe the one from bitstamp. thanks",

We all know how painful crypto tax is, and many people trading on BSC are wondering how the hell they are going to handle their bookkeeping come tax time.\n\nFor anybody who has their head in the sand over the last few years, swapping one cryptocurrency for another generally triggers a capital gain event. And if you are into yield farming, the reward is often classified as income tax depending on your jurisdiction. That means if you are earning for example $EGG and the market tanks, you can be left holding bags as well as being slammed by a huge tax bill that far outweighs what you ever put into crypto in the first place. And for those who say \"just don't pay taxes\", sure, but the IRS and other tax agencies are hiring private companies to do audit trails across the blockchain.\n\nWell [CryptoTaxCalculator](https://cryptotaxcalculator.io) just added native support for Binance Smart Chain! Now you can automatically categorise all your trades on BSC by just adding your public wallet address. We also have native support for PancakeSwap and are working hard to add more protocols over the next few weeks.\n\nCrypto taxes can be extremely stressful, and the complexity of DeFi is not making things easier. With our app you will be able to automate your record keeping and have a clear understanding of your tax liability, as well as detailed portfolio tracking.\n\nA bit about us, we have been around for almost 3 years serving the US, CA, UK, and AU markets. We have direct integrations for over 150 exchanges, automatic categorization of DEX/DeFi protocols, and support margin/futures/staking for most exchanges including Binance. Pricing starts at $49 annually, and we are extremely well priced compared to our competitors.\n\nHopefully this integration makes things easier for people.",

The initiative was supported by financially prominent investors, including the notorious head of the Digital Currency Group Barry Silbert.\n\nThe next growth factor may be the transfer of capital from BNB to BTC due to restrictions on the platform [Binance.com](https://binance.com/).

            "text": "Hey EVERYONE. I have been reading about a lot of redditors being confused as to how the crypto pairs work and how $ value is determined for a coin. \n\nLet me try to elaborate and hopefully clear some of this confusion. (In case I am wrong about this, I'd love to hear what you think about it!) \n\nFirst of all when you talk about crypto pairs {eg. LTC and BTC}, stop talking about $ values at the same time. \n\nWe will consider a crypto pair of LTC BTC for ease of understanding. \n\nDETERMINATION OF $ Value\n\n$ value of 1 LTC is derived by multiplying :\n\"Satoshi Value of 1 LTC x Price in $ of 1 BTC\"\n\nWhile attempting to gain more clarity on crypto pricing, especially for beginners, one should be concerned majorly with the Satoshi values. (Edit: This does not mean that you ignore the $ value) \n\n(Satoshi values are the numbers you see on binance, kucoin etc. Eg. 0.0308000)\n\nTo have a clearer perception, think of it as follows - - - > \n\nRise in $ value of a coin is attributed to 2 things:\n\nA. Rise in value of the other coin {BTC} you exchange for the first coin {LTC}. This rise doesn't affect the Satoshi value. \n\nIn simpler terms the value of LTC is increasing without any increase in its intrinsic Satoshi value. \n\nB. Rise in value of LTC itself. This takes place as a result of market demand and supply forces. \n\nIn simpler terms the intrinsic value of LTC itself is changing as it becomes more or less valuable in itself and not due to price of underlying BTC. \n\nSo, now attempting to explain it practically:\n\nA. In case of a limit order\n\nLimit order is one where you have entered your order for a predetermined amount of Satoshi. It may take time for the coin to reach the exact order price you have entered. \n\nIf BTC rises, the $ value of LTC will RISE. BUT your order won't get executed until the Satoshi value you have inputed is reached. \n\nEg. You placed an order for buying LTC at 0.01 Satoshi, then regardless of $ price, your order will be executed only when the Satoshi of 0.01 is reached on the market. $ value at that time could be 140 dollars or 240 dollars, doesn't matter. You have to look at the Satoshi value.\n\nB. In case of a market order \n\nMarket order is when you buy at the best available market price going at the time of placing your order. It is executed immediately and there is no wait time. \n\nIn this case you will buy LTC at the available Satoshi price (again without regard to the going usd value).\n\nFinally, the part where you get confused! \n\nWhen BTC falls what happens? \n\nAt a time when the price of the underlying is falling, the $ value of LTC will be directly affected and fall as well. Further, the INTRINSIC SATOSHI VALUE OF LTC will also fall due to people selling more LTC than buying. \n\nSame logic applies to when BTC rises as well. \n\nHow would you explain a situation where only BTC falls but $ value of LTC remains constant?\n\nThis is a situation where the fall of underlying BTC is exactly compensated by a corresponding rise in Intrinsic Satoshi Value of LTC. \n\nCheers!\n\nNote: I've already posted this to r/Cryptocurrency where I am engaged with other redditors in further discussions. Beginners would hopefully benefit more from reading the comments posted therein as well!",

With them banning Binance I trust no other exchange, no exchange is near as good as Binance and no exchange is close to as trustable as Binance. Im leaving Cryptocurrency as a whole because of this whole mess and all the manipulation and control the elite want to have over us, I didn't sign up for this I signed up to build wealth and contribute to a more free, happier, and better earth. In conclusion, Canada is China V2 with their look on Cryptocurrency and their government interference with everything which isnt only held to Binance and includes being in heavy lockdowns while the people below us are happy roaming and most don't even need masks anymore, adding vaccine passports, monitoring social media to fine and jail those who are involved in cyberbullying or other things and finally they literally made it so stores can ONLY sell things that they deem \"essential\" (which they did a terrible job at) which only consisted of food so that the average human can't shop, go travel, overall enjoy anything unless they do exactly what they want you to do and to put the cherry on top you cant use binance either.

I do this... \nConvert it to XML or [other low fee crypyos](https://withdrawalfees.com/exchanges/binance). Withdraw it to an exchanger free of fees for the coin you are interested (or fiat), like [Coinbase](http://coinbase.com/join/hunter_j69). \nLastly, convert back to bitcoin or fiat and withdraw for free. I send to PayPal and from my PayPal to my account for **zero fees.** \nOf course there can be trading fees that are more than 0.0005 btc or the fee you are trying to avoid, so look carefully. \nTo Check exchangers withdraw fees you can use:\u00a0[Withdrawal Fees on Cryptocurrency Exchanges](https://withdrawalfees.com/exchanges)\n\nHope you find this helpful, and if you do please use my [referral link](http://coinbase.com/join/hunter_j69):",

I've seen both PROs & CONs arguments of using crypto on Mars. What is your take on this feedback?\n\n**Cryptocurrencies won't work on Mars. We need a proven economic model, not fancy experiments. Lives and Mission Success are at stake here. Please help if you have idea about the economics models that can support a city state of 1 Million on Mars.**\n\nBefore we go blindfold happy on the crypto bandwagon I really want someone from the field to break down how the crypto issues from today will be fixed on Mars: high volatility, anonymous transactions for crime lords, high power consumption. I know I'm cherry picking here and the there is a wonder new crypto from 2019 that fixes all of the above. But before we say: I hear crypto is good let's use it on Mars because some enthusiasts say so without baking this up with some real study case of crypto running a successful economy. Let's put all our bets on this system that in 10 years of existence failed to create main stream support. We will figure out how to bailout when we arrive on Mars and it's a major problem there. Sorry for the harsh words but I've watched the crypto craze for too long to not have a stab at this. Let's figure out for real. What currency and economic model will we use on Mars?\n\nI have joined a team designing a city for 1 million inhabitants on Mars. Nexus Aurora is focused on open sourcing space colonisation. The entire project started after The Mars Society launched the [Mars City State Design Competition](https://www.marssociety.org/news/2020/02/11/mars-city-state-design-competition-announced/).",

Just so the app doesn't crash in the first few minutes of the launch we're going to restrict the number of closed beta testers to about 50 or so.\n\nOnce we're confident it runs fine (and will have inevitably fixed the bugs that'll come out of the closed beta) we'll do an Open Beta followed by a full release.\n\nJoin us at [r/aesirofficial](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/aesirofficial/) for more updates or simply apply for closed beta access here: [https://aesircrypto.com/signup.html](https://aesircrypto.com/signup.html)",

Once we all agree on the parameters and details of the coin, we will generate the coin without any keys and renouncing ownership which means no one in the group can do anything to modify the parameters later on.\n\nIt's up to everyone in the group to make this project a success.No money will be spent until loads and loads of planning takes place and we all agree on the next stages of the project and best places to spend any funds if needed\n\nMany things are needed, trying to do everything and managing everything  yourself is just not possible. I have some really cool ideas but I would like to merge my ideas with a group and share the responsibility of the project with everyone. Imagine a whole group of us working as one to get this thing up and running, the chances of success are much better. Would also like to have some face to face meet ups too.\n\nYou don't have to be experienced in programming so ANYONE can join but need to be passionate and committed to the project and know how to work politely in a team.",

Build up coping strategies outside crypto - as another poster said there is more to life in money (and it is never enough and can always be lost and gained).\n\nI lost a crapload with Titan, then selling early when Tomb was Tanking, etc... I move on by learning something and testing it with a strategy and small bag I can lose, then learning again.  \n\nIt helps to have good supports in everything you do, including those who know crypto, your family, work, etc - diversify your life.",

Mayex provides Free Spot Trading, USDT Margin Perpetual Contract and Coin Margin Perpetual Contract. There are Over 100 crypto trading pairs on this platform.\n\nWhen Mayex was established, it was determined to be a subversive of traditional exchanges. Mayex\u2019s vision is to make every transaction more profitable and become the most competitive crypto trading platform. To this end, Mayex is completely free for spot trading, and the derivatives trading rate is as low as 0.01%. The team redesigned the entire trading engine based on the experience of \u201cthe Binance\u201d , it supports non-stop hot updates and multi-level risk control. Test results show that the new engine can support 400K orders per second.\n\nJohn Davis, one of the co-founders of the Mayex, joined Binance as a technology executive after more than six years of quantitative trading. He mentioned:\n\n\u201cThe whole crypto trading industry is quite suitable for high frequency trading. However, the cost of crypto trading is too high. Our goal is to allow users in this industry to enjoy faster, safer and lower-cost trading.\u201d\n\nWe shared these ideas with our former colleagues and we all decided to work together to create a new trading platform to make it happen, and we have done it.\n\nhttps://bitcoinwarrior.net/2022/03/former-binance-team-launches-free-crypto-exchange-mayex/",

According to the latest data released yesterday by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the indexed consumer price rose 0.8% in February, bringing the current annual inflation rate in the US to 7.9%. That is the highest level since January 1982. Energy, petrol, food and house prices were the main contributors to the increase. \n\nThe energy price has increased by 25.6% in the past year, while gasoline and natural gas have increased by 38% and 23.8% respectively. Global inflation rates started to rise significantly before the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Two years of covid lockdowns and massive buyout programs in response to the COVID pandemic contributed to inflation. Now that a war has also been started by the world's largest exporter of natural gas, oil and fertilizers, the inflation problem is only bigger.\n\nRight now im researching a project called Fusang. Fusang Is Already Way Ahead of the Competition. Fusang exchange is a fully-licensed player in the traditional and digital exchange spaces. Its offerings cater to companies looking into primary and secondary market offerings and cater to the end user interested in investing for future returns.

In a nutshell, this firm collaborates with well-known organizations such as Steam, Epic Games, Amazon, and others. Currently, the company has a number of ready-made projects. Dustland is a new event that they've put up for us.\n\nI'm not sure about you, but I enjoy post-apocalyptic games like STALKER, Fallout, and MadMax. As a result, I'm looking forward to its imminent release. The image is adequate. I believe it is the finest representation of all available GameFi devices at this time.\n\nThe main character is one of many survivors in the aftermath of a series of global calamities, struggling to find his place in a new world. The hero is forced to fight for his life by collecting materials to enhance his costume, equipment, and shelter/base. In the \"new world,\" survival resources have become increasingly limited, and as a result, everyone requires them. The unfettered freedom of survivors has become a big concern due to a lack of norms and constraints. Killing whomever has what you need is the easiest way to get it. In any scenario, the hero is free to do anything he wishes. He chooses his own path. Explore the wasteland alone in search of anything valuable, establish a group and engage in robbery and murder, or trade. It is vital to remember that there is only one law in the wasteland: every man for himself.",

The investment earned the firm two seats amongst the publication\u2019s board.\n\nBinance is also reportedly one of the few firms looking to acquire Chelsea Football Club.

Almost all the Binance stacking, saving and bnb vault is without risks except DEFI stacking. So if you search at stacking and saving Binance on internet you will find a lot. And the 12% apy is based on 365 days a year every day + on flexible it changes a lot for example 3 weeks ago BUSD was 10% on flexible it\u2019s now 7%.\n\nWhen you do locked stacking your apy will be higher than on flexible. \n\nAny more questions just ask me",

Dehealth promises a lot of additional services, such as ordering medicines (no need to go to the same pharmacies) and even its own token with which we can pay for all services and medicines. \n\nCrypto will change the world.

What do you think about it?For my mind there are a lot of boring projects on the NFT market now, but I read about Zamio NFT TrillioHeirs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeems that Zamio is quite intresting project. Guys create a hybrid on-chain CeFi&DeFi ecosystem that bridges real capital to blockchain. At the center of the ecosystem is the $ZAM token. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now Zamio announced the release of the NFT collection TrillioHeirs, ZAM.DAO, Zamio Ventures, and Zamio Incubator. But the coolest thing is ZAMpad. As I understand it, NFT will give access precisely within the entire Zamio system, but it is not very clear when the actual start of sales will be and what exactly I will get in the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think? Have you heard about Zamio project?",

You may proceed to withdrawl\u201d when i try to withdraw then it says \u201cyour account might be at risk and contact customer aupport\u201d. I have been trying to solve this issue since a week and #customer Support of /binance is sleeping. \nOne memeber of CS asked me to submit a Questionaire for declaration of wealth. I have done that too since a week and still case is not solved. Every day your CS tells that they are finding a solution with relevant team. But you guys sucks. Yesterday i even got an email that your account would be deactivated permanently so withdraw your assets before 31.12.2021. How can i withdraw when even after putting 3 verfications codes for withdrawl you guys send a pop up that your account might be at risk and contact custome support. I have 9k-10k worth of crypto assets and you guys are trying to steal my money for your christmas bonus.\nIf its happening with other fellow binance users, kindly report it.",

The best way to learn is to try hundreds of trades first with very small money & I mean small like $10. \n\nThe market ain\u2019t running away anytime soon. \n\nThe second most important thing is that u MUST have like a $1000 in your trading account & never ever enter trades exceeding 10% of that. The means that 900 is just idle there if not more. This would allow u to double the order near liquidation which brings us to No. 3;\n\nAlways place an order near liquidation if you don\u2019t want to put a stop loss but this leads us to the rule of Number 4: \n\nUnless you intend to sit there watching the movement on a min by min basis then you MUST always put a Stop Loss. Raise this stop loss to a small earning later when you are in profit. \n\nNow No. 5: DO NOT trade BTC or ETH until you have $10,000 while trading with $100. The swings are just too much touching liquidation in a blink of an eye. \n\nHere is No. 6: do not and I mean DO NOT double down through the trade! Once it\u2019s open, leave it to play out. Don\u2019t see the chart going up (if longing) and add more market order to the existing order. This leads us to No. 7:\n\nMaking small profits per day will accumulate to $100-200 from the $100 u invest. Be happy and content with that. DO NOT get too excited coz u lost and wanna make up what u lost in an hour. You will loose more! After u build a good knowledge and base money from earning, then u can open many trades at the same time. But always always always use 10% of trading funds in trades and keep the rest idle as emergency funds. \n\nI hope all this makes sense and u can relate. Good luck.",

I can see my cryptos as assets in my wallet but I can't find anything else than withdraw and deposit which seems to be something completely different than selling them.\n\nI am sorry for asking such a noob question but I'm really confused. \n\nThank you.",

Might try with spot grid trading, more on that at the end of the post.\n\nAnd so, I thought I should ignore that for now, and focus more on the \"invest\" type functionality offered by binance. Stuff like liquid swap, dual investment, etc... Basically the Earn functionality.\n\nBut seeing as I still have a smallish amount to play with, I feel it would be more profitable to put all of it into one such method of investment, rather than split it up into all or most (at least for now).\n\nWhat method would you recommend is best for increasing the amount of crypto say in BTC you own (value is not as important for the moment)? \n\nAbout spot grid trading: best resources to learn how/when to use it? Is it just automated buying/selling, and so no different to regular trading for someone who doesnt have the knowledge and experience of reading markets?\n\nSorry for the long post, and thank you in advance if you took the time to read it all and reply!",

Lots of traders on either articles, servers and youtube share their experience in the trading world, so check them out if you can.\r  \n\r  \nThe Earn system is pretty straightforward. You either hodl your cryptos, stake them or invest in them. If you\u2019re looking for cryptos with high APYs, then I\u2019d advise you to keep an eye on new projects. Their volatility makes buying them too risky, so developers present an excessively high amount of APY to compensate. Stable coins are also a viable option, however.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I feel like I want to earn quick bucks, I usually visit [BSC Coins](https://bsc-coins.com/) to see what new coins have just been registered in the BSC network, then I do my research and hodl them using the Earn system if they show enough promise.",

However the fee to withdraw SOL is 0.01 SOL (approx $1).\n\nSo it nah be cheapest to convert BTC to Sol, send it to another exchange like Coinbase Pro and then convert and withdraw to a wallet that way. \n\nDoes anyone have a cheaper way around?\n\nAlso interested if someone knows a similar way for funds on Crypto.com (although I appreciate this is the wrong sub-Reddit).

Their website literally says:\n\n\"Refer Friends. Earn Crypto Together.\"\n\nAfter seeing this naturally I introduced this @binance promotion to my friends, family members and work associates, many of them new to crypto but encouraged by the idea they would receive a 100 USDT Cashback Voucher they went ahead and invested $50 USD worth or more on @binance platform\n\nSo why is this misleading you might think? Well because after 48 hours when @binance send us this \"100 USDT Cashback Voucher\" we realized this balance its only good for the trading fees you generate in your spot trading and also only valid for 14 days\n\nHow could an user who was just introduced to @binance and maybe to the whole crypto spectre take advantage of this \"100 USDT Cashback Voucher\".\n\nThey would need to spend on average 10K USD worth of trading to spend the whole voucher in less than 14 days!! (Trading fees are less than 1 cent in most of the trades)\n\nDo you think @binance isn't aware of this? That a crypto newbie won't do spend 10K worth of trading at least not in their first 14 days? \n\nBut guess what? They still decided launch this misleading promotion and get liquidity from new users.\n\nSome of you might say you should have read the terms. But you will need to dig really deep into @binance website to see the voucher its only good for trading fees.\n\nWhen you go to the Promotion it doesn't say anything about it only being good for fees, not even under the Rules or FAQ of the promotion.\n \nYou need to go to a section called \"Cashback Voucher Term and Conditions\" to notice it says it is only good for fees.\n\nAt this point I feel so ashamed and embarrased with all the people I got to Sign Up, give all their personal information and invest $50 on @binance platform. I might need to at least buy that balance from them to cope with myself. This truly ruined my feelings for @binance.\n\nI've always seen @cz_binance as such a nice guy and watching him speak thought he cared about the people at @binance. I hope he doesn't know anything about this shady practice and instead its someone else trying to earn points on the team.\n\nMisleading people for short term gain its not the way to get new users to get interested in @binance or the world of blockchain. It is instead a way of discouraging them and they might never want to come back.\n\nI know this can't be @czbinance vision.\n\nu/jjhBnc\nu/Binance\nu/symbiotic_bnb-angel\nu/AutoModerator\nu/symbiotic_bnb\nu/BinanceCS\nu/RIBKA-BINANCE\nu/Dheon5\nu/Nelson_BNB\nu/snate6\nu/tpmv69\nu/BinanceRedditHelp",

Your goal should be to own the highest percentage of the token you can.\n\nHere's why:\n\nIf you can buy up 3% of the tokens you own 3% of the investment fund.  It does not matter what the price does because the investment fund is not influenced by the token price.\n\nThey already put crypto in the investment fund but they have formed a company that is soon going to allow them to include real world assets in the fund. The possibilities are endless but here is one.\n\nLet's say they buy a commercial building for $400,000 and that building appreciates by $200,000. \n\nYou own 3% of that and it will not change as long as you hold and it does NOT matter what the price or volume is.\n\nThis is what makes BANK$ special.",

My account was hacked on the 17th of February as i received an email of an attempted USDT withdrawal of my whole portfolio. Luckly the automatic system had rejected the withdrawal and my withdrawal and trading functions were temporarily locked awaiting for my KYC to be provided .\nI connect with customer support immediately asking what was happening and of course they started to copy paste procedures to me. Unable to talk with a decent customer support ( the Bot does a better job at listening to you ) , i secured my account according to their SOPs and provided with the required KYC.\nI also told them that i would have withdrawn to my bank account in Euros ( which is the only way i have ever withdrawn since i opened the account ) once they would have lifted the lock on my functions.\nI managed to verify my account.\nHowever , shortly after , I was receiving messages on my phone of somebody else successfully adding P2P method of payment , so i contacted support straight away but NOBODY was there to answer me.\nDespite following their securiy protocol , despite having 2fa , kyc verified account , enabled extra security measures like changing email , password and enabling mobile verification, the hacker was still in my account and managed to add P2P method ( how could they allowed them to do it ? My account was even KYC verified since many months back ) and withdrew all of my balance ( = life savings ) . Binance justified it by saying that the IP used was similar to mine ( let's not forget that not too long before it alerted the automatic system ).\nBinance told me that the case should be reported to the police and foward the report to their law enforcement department , which i did on the 18th of February and again after 1 week because nobody at customer support was able to tell me if the had received the report or not. I contact them almost every day : they were saying sorry for what happened and then putting me on hold for 6 hours so that i could speak with the \"specialist\" , eventually to have the same reply: contact us after the weekend ( law enforcement is off ) , then after 3 days , then after some days. Endless tickets opened and put on pending with no reply.\nI can say that up until now , there was NO response from Binance law enforcement . I cannot open a legal case against anybody because i have no information to provide the police with. Information that Binance has.\nI started to follow up the case with my lawyer and the answer that my lawyer received was that i am the sole responsible of the safety of my funds and that no report was sent to the law enforcement department. I feel hopeless and extremely disappointed by what it is considered the best exchange in the world. Best at not caring about your funds. If I can save at least one person from what i went through , that would be already a victory . But bitter for sure.",

Its BAYC's success is due to fantastic marketing & sales.\n\nMy blog post in full: [https://www.dantehq.com/article/I6So\\_QvrMeV48TYPjsPctR/twilight-of-the-apes-the-bear-case-for-apecoin](https://www.dantehq.com/article/I6So_QvrMeV48TYPjsPctR/twilight-of-the-apes-the-bear-case-for-apecoin)",

DeFiance Capital co-led the raise, with Three Arrows Capital and SkyVision Capital also investing. This initial $4.5 million raise took the form of a sale of Ultiverse\u2019s governance token MXS.\n\nBut now Binance Labs has chosen to invest another $5 million in the equity of Ultiverse, according to both companies. Nicole Zhang, director at Binance Labs, told The Block that the additional investment was made to ensure the firms are \u201cbonded in a way that we have some sort of a say in terms of the team\u2019s future path.\u201d\n\nIt is not news that Binance invests a lot in projects. Some projects that Binance Labs has invested in and innovative platforms that I hope it invests in are Binary X, Biswap, Social Good, Nine Chronicles, Blink, Tenderly and so on.",

I love to be honest with myself and surrounders.   \nThe crypto boom gave  a lot of new abilities to express people's feelings. NFTs allow artists to create whatever they want and sell on the secondary market. And i appreciate those artists who don\u2019t afraid of creating sexual conent as well. They do this mostly for you, not themselves. They want to make you buy their artworks and join the community of honest and fearless people. Many such collections were minted already and gained success. People earn a lot by retailing them.   \nRecently my attention was grabbed with a new 10 000 sexual NFTs collection on ETH blockchain  by prominent artist Tarusov. He created ten thousand cards of muses which are pretty symbolic. He has already sold the third part  of them for 0.08 ETH and the price for the rest will grow.

Ultimately, bittrex is in control since the money is in their wallet but they wont do anything about it \n2. I'm disappointed how stupid this thing is, I mean I now understand that there are network options that are important and must be considered (not like an optional thing), but the thing is, imagine sending ETH from one wallet to the other, both wallets correct, and you can still lose your money just because of the damn network option. I can imagine how many people may have lost money this way",

When i started i got scammed and lost $2000. \n\nSometimes the learning curve is painful but once you learn how do to things and what things to do to stay safe, crypto is a much better world than centralized organizations. You are in control and will stay safe as long as you dont mess up..\n\nKeep in mind exchanges are also centralized. Your own wallet is not. But you need to keep your seed phrase safe.\n\nGood luck!",

If there are assets you are just holding for the long term, I would look at other wallet options (soft/hard wallets etc) and move your long term holdings to a wallet which ypu have control over. \n\nThe only thing I can liken Binance to is kind of like renting/leasing a property over owning your own. While you can live in a rented property and for all intent and purposes it is \"your\" home, you ultimately do not have control over it and you are to some degree at the whim of the landlord. If the landlord decides to raise rent, change your contract terms, ask you to vacate the property etc, you have no options really, other than to comply. \n\nI am sure there are better analogies, but you catch my drift I am sure.",

Research the exchange history for hacks to see the likelihood of yours getting swiped off the exchange, but good exchanges will compensate their customers and the chances of this happening can be relatively small on most bigger exchanges. Wallets can be compromised too, so know your different wallet types and dangers there like dusting attacks, scam contracts interacting with your wallet, scam NFTs or losing phrase keys for cold wallets and your crypto forever. Everything has its own risk. \n\nKnow that the exchange will charge you part of the crypto you're trying to transfer as a fee, but once outside the exchange you will have to pay in the native blockchain for transferring. For example, the exchange may charge you 300,000 shiba-inu to transfer 100,000,000, but once it's in your wallet you now have to pay Etherium (look up current gas prices OMG!!!) to transfer anywhere else or back onto the exchange...this gets soooo many people who didn't research this beforehand and can't afford the Etherium to move it back out of their wallet.\n\nLearn as much as you can and research before doing anything related to your crypto, or your mistakes will cost you money almost every time. Most of us learned from some mistakes at the cost of our money, hopefully you get spared from that as much as possible.",

I\u2019m not skeptical on all of it but the vast majority of these projects are marketed as MLM marketing schemes which try to get people who are uninformed about the metaverse suckered in to [buy \u201cvirtual land\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaversestartup/comments/s4ktdc/are_we_all_going_to_pay_rent_to_land_owners_in/) at a high price at which they must sell it to others.\n\nThis is the exact same strategy those \u201cstart at home\u201d businesses use. You have to pay like $4000 for some worthless books or some sub-par product and now you were stuck with a product that you have to sell to your friends.\n\nThey deceive people by calling doubters propagators of fear. They over-highlight the big successes without giving people real statistics on what\u2019s going. What\u2019s often going on is that the vast majority of people are losing money.\n\nWhen it comes to the metaverse we are seeing the exact same strategy. Mark Zuckerberg changing the name of his company has become \u201cproof\u201d that this is a big deal.\n\nHowever, what most people don\u2019t know is that he is betting on the long-term future of augmented and virtual reality and not on the same old virtual world stuff we\u2019ve had for the last 18 years.\n\nIf this \u201cland\u201d had real value or was tied to real (like foot traffic) other than false scarcity than it would have value. however, marketers have known for centuries that if you make something scarce people want it.\n\nCan\u2019t you see it they\u2019re suckering you?!\n\nOne of the great tragedies of human life has been that landowners for generations have oppressed those who didn\u2019t have the wealth to obtain land. When you duplicate this problem artificially in the virtual world without having real value tied to these spaces or a real reason for the scarcity, you end up in a situation where you\u2019re going to have very few people willing to pay to use land in some virtual world.\n\nJust as any individual webpage does not represent the Internet, [no individual virtual world represents the metaverse](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaversestartup/comments/rittso/what_is_the_metaverse_in_detail/). It is very unlikely that any of these present worlds will have so many people that land will be scarce. If there is going to be one dominant space it\u2019s very unlikely to be any of the ones we have right now because we are much too early and augmented and virtual reality are going to play a big part in shaping the space.\n\nWhen buying land you are betting that the virtual world that you\u2019re working with will not be beaten by a better product. Most of these worlds don\u2019t even support virtual reality much less augmented reality. You are much too early and you are the sucker.\n\nI\u2019m saying this because I care. Please, please listen.\n\nI remember playing in virtual worlds with tons of other people when I was a kid on Xbox live. It\u2019s nothing new and if those decades have proven anything it\u2019s that people are not switching to virtual worlds unless the usability is a lot higher.\n\nRight now Blockchain and crypto don\u2019t solve those usability problems but augmented reality might.\n\nYou can tell the difference between the scams and the real deal by imagining if there is a large scale proposition for an end-user. Most of these virtual worlds just have investors selling stuff to other investors and very few actual joyful gamers or actual users.\n\nDo your own research and keep your money in your pocket in the meantime and be aware that we are not voting for all these NFT projects on the sub but it\u2019s actually [paid votes](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaverse/comments/teri0g/this_is_a_quick_reminder_that_there_is_a_whole/).\n\nIf you\u2019re tired of this rolling scam and want to save the idea and the purity of virtual worlds let\u2019s take action to down vote the projects that we all have come to see claiming that they are the Metaverse\u2026 the next big thing\u2026 and if you buy now you can sell for millions later.\n\nIf you want to get informed on the real subject of virtual worlds check out [this link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaverse/comments/qzluxn/places_to_begin_studying_the_metaverse/)",

If you are a US resident or citizen, please register for an account at binance.us\n\n**There are two ways around this:**\n\n1 - Contact your ISP and pay to have a static IP in a UK registered netblock and risk keeping your crypto in Binance\n\n2 -  Get everything out of Binance and use another exchange\n\nAfter 2 weeks with binance support they are still telling me to login/out and to delete the cache. This has NOTHING to do with it. It is THEIR system using an unreliable location lookup method. I switched to a UK registered netblock and everything works flawlessly (and they are STILL telling me to login/out delete cookies)\n\n**How to find out your situation**\n\nWhen you login from a new/other device, you might get an email saying new login detected from .... location: El Segundo, California, for example. Obviously you're not in California\n\nUse google to \"what is my IP\" and write down your IP (you can usually see the location on a map with these services which will show that it is in the UK)\n\nGo to [https://whois.domaintools.com/](https://whois.domaintools.com/) and you can put in your IP, this will show you the range it is in (the netblock), who owns it (your ISP) and where that range is registered. Here you will see a match with what Binance claims.\n\nThis is why Binance think you're in the USA, because they are using unreliable methods to locate IPs.\n\nNow you can request a static IP from your ISP in a UK registered block (this is important to specify). This can take 10-20 minutes depending on your provider and you will need to reboot/reconnect your router.\n\nRepeat the steps above to A: Confirm you're now in a UK registered netblock and B: Prove the problem is with Binance",

My deepest thanks goes out to this Reddit community, as it could not have been done without you guys! Thank you so very much--especially to all the people that reached out to genuinely help and work through various solutions. Thank you thank you thank you!\n\nDetails: After this thread blew up and gained enough attention for a mod to respond, I had a CS rep reach out on the Binance support chat to submit a request on my behalf to increase my withdrawal limits. Unfortunately, the ticket was then mistakenly closed out without my limits ever increasing. So, I went through the process of reopening the ticket and resubmitting all the documentation. Fortunately, a few hours later, another CS rep from the escalations team named Leon reached back out on the chat support to follow up on the withdrawal limit increase. He was incredibly responsive and we waited on the line together while he was able to push the limit increase through to 18 BTC. After my account got unlocked, I proceeded to trade all the random coins/tokens I had into XLM for an easier and faster transfer out of Binance. Once that was complete, I initiated the withdrawal request for one lump sum into my Ledger. Probably a bad idea, but I just wanted everything out of there ASAP before I ran out of time. I thought it was over and I was ELATED, but after waiting for 30 minutes, the XLM never arrived in my wallet, so I checked back into Binance and noticed that the withdrawal was stuck in \"Pending Approval\" with no tx ID. Luckily, Leon was still waiting on the chat support line to confirm everything had worked, and I let him know it was stuck. He said he would escalate the withdrawal request for me, and about 1 hour later, he followed up saying that the withdrawal was approved. I didn't know withdrawals needed to be \"approved\" on a decentralized exchange, but that won't be a problem anymore. In any case, once it was approved, I was quickly assigned a tx ID and within a few minutes, the XLM cleared and showed up in my hardware wallet. All good! Or so I thought. I noticed that all of the XLM I was expecting didn't arrive and after some troubleshooting with Leon, we discovered it was because the 18 BTC withdrawal limit was too low, so we went through the entire process again to request another limit increase to 20 BTC (which I had originally requested for in the first place). Once that was all approved, we repeated the same steps to get the last remaining XLM out of Binance and into my ledger wallet with about 4 hours to spare on the Binance death clock. \n\nThe whole process with Leon took about 3.5 hours and it took about 40 hours for a CS rep to respond with the overwhelming support from the Reddit community. It would not have been possible without a competent CS rep and I know there are thousands of users in this exact situation that have yet to be addressed by anyone from Binance. I realize how lucky and fortunate I am to have had the support of this entire community! Thank you from the bottom of my heart! \n\nBut BINANCE -- THERE IS STILL WORK TO BE DONE! You have proven that you are willing to do the right thing and help customers, but the support staff needs to grow exponentially to address all the users currently locked out! I somehow managed to make it out alive, but there are still thousands of others stuck with no response from the CS team. For those that are still waiting, there is definitely hope. We need to continue working together to push Binance to respond and assist to all of their customers in a timely manner because current wait times are completely unacceptable. \n\nBinance, the entire crypto community is counting on you to do the right thing! And Reddit, thank you with all my soul. This truly could not have been done without you all. Thank you!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

I do look at this project as a long term project and fully expect it to be in the top 10-20 in due time with the amazing change it\u2019s making to the world and helping the hodlers with passive income.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the coin was originally created as a meme coin based off of Elon Musk\u2019s tweet ([https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1375033483148451842?s=21](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1375033483148451842?s=21)) I personally believe this is now far from the truth now that the coin has evolved and revolutionised the charity crypto coin scene.\n\nThese are REAL donations to REAL charities, making REAL WORLD CHANGES.\n\nSome of the charities and donations include:\n\n* Pledged + $300,000 - COVID Relief in India.\n* Donation + $300,000 - Mark Rober\u2019s Color The Spectrum (Hosted by Jimmy Kimmel).\n* Pledged + $300,000 - Human Relief Foundation.\n* Donation + $400,000 - Big Green (Kimbal Musk).\n* Donation + $250,000 - Children International.\n* Donation + $250,000 - The Ocean Cleanup.\n* Donation + $250,000 - Action Against Hunger.\n* Donation + $75,000 - Children International.\n\nElongate has been helping in Iraq ON THE FLOOR. Do all these other \u201ccharity coins\u201d actually do this! Seriously guys, the coin is making a huge difference here and changing peoples\u2019 lives. You can\u2019t not appreciate this! [https://twitter.com/jay\\_butt/status/1389138172332937218?s=21](https://twitter.com/jay_butt/status/1389138172332937218?s=21) [https://twitter.com/jay\\_butt/status/1389500979020697601?s=21](https://twitter.com/jay_butt/status/1389500979020697601?s=21) [https://twitter.com/jay\\_butt/status/1389870696814239746?s=21](https://twitter.com/jay_butt/status/1389870696814239746?s=21)\n\n**So, reading all this I hope it\u2019s slowly starting to change your view into what an amazing coin this actually is**",

I missed the note when I sent the coins\n\nI tried at the time but it wasn't worth much and provided support with everything.\n\nKraken called me to try to resolve. Gave me exactly what binance needed, code etc.\n\nI have tried self help, sent numerous tickets and nothing.\n\nNot the most money in the world but it's about $500 US dollars I would like to get if I could.\n\nI have the transaction ID and address, it is in their account, should be easy to verify imo but they send carbon copy emails everytime telling me to go to self service but every time I get stuck in Step 2.\n\nI love crypto binance and your variety of alts but you need to update the customer service imo. Your rich enough now to have phone and chat support with authorization to help people access their cash. At this point I basically feel like the money is gone.\n\nAppreciate any help or advice. TY!",

I responded immediately with all the same/matching material and info as I signed up with. That was a week ago. I followed up to that email today and still no answer. \nThe most helpful info I received was to reach out to my state\u2019s Division of Securities to have them write a letter to Binance.US. A user here did that and received their funds along with Binance.US\u2019s attorney asking them to keep the situation hush. It\u2019s sad but I guess the only pressure they respond to is legal action.\n\nComplaints submitted with SEC, BBB, DCA, CFPB, and my state\u2019s division of securities.\n\nOP 4/6/2021\nIt\u2019s been weeks and months and I\u2019ve gotten no response from Binance.US. I have over $200k in my portfolio and I am unable to withdrawal to my bank or send to another crypto wallet. Please upvote to get my ticket responded to ASAP. \nI tried a small test transaction to whitelist approved wallet address as well as my bank account (same account I used to deposit all funds). I have had a Binance.US account for over a year. I am still getting the same \u201cwithdrawals suspended due to risk management\u201d. I have had my past tickets closed for trying to get help on what additional info they need from me to mitigate risk and no response. \n\n\nLatest ticket number is #625034",

When waiting for the transaction to compete in the Binance app (this is where it says \"Your transaction may take a few seconds to compete\" or something like that), i am given an error message saying \"Failed Transaction\". I have been talking to the support (two or three times I can't remember) and have sent four Request Tickets. Still on the 11th of February no money to my bank account, even though the support said that it will take couple of days for the money to be refunded.\nPlease Help.\n\nUpdate (21/02): At this point i think the support team is messing with me. After waiting almost every day at insanely long queues to talk to them, the time finally comes and i log in to speak with one of the CS personnel.\nThey informed me that they know about my situation and about which transaction i am referring to (they even state the amount i tried to deposit and the crypto i tried to buy). After a time they took to evaluate my case, they say that they contacted the refund team and that they will do whatever it takes to resolve my issue. Last but not least, the CS said twice that they will push my situation and \"pressure\" the Refund team to answer me via email within the next hour. Well that was days ago and no email from Binance.The only positive thing was that the CS was really polite and kind, but my issue still exists. I will contact my bank as a lot of you guys suggest and hope for the best.",

It showed that the money left my account and didn\u2019t transfer into my account. 4 days later it came up as a failed transaction and several days later it still wasn\u2019t sent back into my bank account. \nI sent binance customer service an email and they had a generic response.\nI spoke to my bank, which they had confirmation that the money did go through and said to speak to them.\nI escalated it with the bank and asked them to trace the transaction for further authentication. As soon as I did that, a day or two later the money was returned to my account. This was in Australia \nGood luck",

And if you think that sucks try getting gas for your car with a 11 gallon gas tank and get a $200 hold put on your card.. I couldnt even exceed 50 if I had tried.. 200 was severe over kill.. and I flipped out when I saw the charge because it said I paid them that money not a hold but straight up said I paid them the money.. I guess holds dont always say hold on them.. my bad got learned a lesson the hard way now I pay cash. You could be in this a long wait",

Back when the last crypto craze hit the world at the end of 2017, I used [binance.com](https://binance.com) and was able to trade some bitcoin for XRP and IOTA.... Stupid financial move looking back now.  Anyway, last year I created an account with [Binance.us](https://Binance.us) and moved the majority of my assets from [Binance.com](https://Binance.com) to other wallets.  I moved my XRP to coinbase and IOTA to Binance.us.  Didn't have any problems.  I still have a handful of coins that I don't care about at Binance.com though... They'll probably just linger there indefinitely.  I recently found that I can buy Dogecoin on [Binance.us](https://Binance.us), so I went in on that, but all this talk of locked accounts is making me nervous.  I'm thinking about buying a \"cold storage\" wallet so that I can get my crypto off of these online wallets.  I've heard horror stories of people having their online wallets hacked and their assets stolen with little to no recourse from the crypto exchanges that got hacked... It's the wild wild west right now.  Good luck to you all!",

People experience problems in Binance.com as well, the thing that many do wrong is make transactions that are just too big. Customer support is overwhelmed, so better to not send amounts of money all at once that are high enough to be flagged. A bit of research would prevent this since it\u2019s an ongoing topic here on Reddit. But newbies don\u2019t do research and keep coming here with these issues. Been using Binance for 4 years. Don\u2019t like that they are centralised and this BSC crap but I never had any problem with Binance.",

Of course the big players and institutionals have some vip special deals with different exchanges and there is no Need for them to split it in this way. BUT every single ordinary Customer need to think about Risk managment in crypto Space. Cause all of this is unregulated. They have some warm promises, fake insurances, sidedeals whatever but they are still ALL unregulated. What do you think what kind of insurance wanna pay at the end of the day for a unregistraded und unregulated Security or crypto asset offer ?  And in my opinion more than 90% of all Altcoin projects are hidden security\u2019s. And thats the reason why you need to splitted. Different exchanges, Lendingplattforms like Celsius, nexos or bitwala. Hot Storage like Atomic wallet and cold Storage like Ledger or so with integrated Exchange options. Of course they cost a little bit more fee but better paying a little bit more selling fee as to have the risk beeing shutting down from one day to the other. The first and only really goverment and federal banking backed crypto oportunity I ever heard about is still in switzerland. Any other option are unregulated. That\u2019s the point you need to understand when you beeing and invest in crypto at this moment.",

And best of luck for everyone who has problems with Binance!\n\nRemember keep your crypto out of exchanges if possible!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHello, So my Binance account withdrawals got automatically banned 4 MONTHS ago, because I made too many crypto withdrawals(I divided my cryptos into many different wallets).\n\nThere was a text showing on my account, that I have to do face identification(on phone) again to enable my withdrawals, so I did that 4 months ago, but it didn't worked, and my Binance account's balance was relatively small about 2000$, so I came to conclusion that I can leave my funds on Binance account for now.\n\nFast forward to mid-february. My Binance account crypto investment has grown to over 30,000$+, and I sold them all for dollars, and tried to withdraw them, my withdrawals still suspended.\n\nI contacted customer service they answered me couple times, copy-pasta etc bullshit.\n\nWeek ago they asked me record video of deposits/withdrawals from another exchange, so I did. / Video of me showing my face and holding my passport and repeating copy pasta text, So I DID.\n\nThey asked account registration day and IP, I delivered.\n\nAnd now they have stopped answering me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- My account is verified\n\n\\- My identity is verified\n\n\\- My address is verified\n\nBonus assures: Bad english skills, declining hairline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope, I am not scammed by world biggest crypto exchange. Not your keys, Not your coins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

I'M JUST SOME RANDOM GUY ON REDDIT*\n\n*This is assuming you already have L3 identity verification (the one that takes up to 15 days)*\n\n\nFirst, If you have any chargebacks, you should be allowed to transfer funds to settle the chargeback. Do so. You do owe them that money, but TRANSFER ONLY WHAT YOU OWE!! Because once that transaction settles, your account will be automatically locked, and you won't be able to withdraw, deposit, or trade.\n\nSecond, you'll receive an email from Binance (US if you're American) asking for a selfie video and a bank statement. Ignore that. I'm still waiting on a response for that ticket. (I personally believe that's an identity verification email, but if you're already L3 verified, the ticket gets closed out. That's just speculation, though)\n\nWhat you're gonna do instead is submit a ticket under Deposits and Withdrawals > Crypto Transfer > Crypto Withdrawal. For the topic of your request, put Account Locked. In the body of the email just state that your account is locked and you need them to unlock your account. Theoretically, if you can't make deposits and you still owe for a chargeback, you could ask them to enable deposits so you can satisfy the chargeback, then submit a second ticket requesting withdrawals to be enabled.\n\n2 HOURS LATER!!!\n\nMy account was unlocked!\n\nBinance US needs to change the automated email is sends for rejected transfers. \n\nFurthermore! SOME BANKS WILL REJECT ALL TRANSFER REQUESTS TO CRYPTO EXCHANGES!!!! Make sure you bank isn't one of them!\n\nHope this works for you guys.",

They escalated the issue and I'm waiting for a response. But I'm wondering if anyone here can help me?\n\nThe case ID is #74860477\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for your replies. I don't know how it happend but it might have been a Trojan through an API. I didn't understand it very well. \n\nBad news is that transactions have been made, so I'm sure I've lost all my money. Which is weird because binance states that it blocks withdrawals for 24 hours or even 48 hours if the email and 2FA is changed (which I did have, but they changed my email and 2FA).\n\nNow I can recover my account by sending a video with my information but I'm pretty sure everything is gone. Feels bad.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nJust got my account back. There was an API installed and it got accessed from a different IP address. \n\nNow the strangest thing happened, they converted all my crypto into POLS (polkadotstarter). So my portfolio took a 22% dip but they didn't send my crypto to their address for some reason. I took all the security measures and consider myself lucky not everything is gone. \n\nThanks everyone for your help.\n\nEdit 3:\n\nThey made 100's of transactions buying POLS and other shit coins really high, and then selling them really low. I think they just had an engine running and my account got blocked on time so they couldn't continue to take everything (just 25%).",

After some research I found out that binance sent mails and the hacker deleted them in Gmail (you can restore deleted mails).\n\nHowever, the hacker managed that he either didn't needed the third factor or he got it somehow.. My isp said I got no sms so he might got access to my Google authenticator...\n\nLong story short, I didn't get anything back. Moved most of my assets away from binance and for the rest renewed all factors and added a yubikey.\n\nAnyway, in my eyes there is a bug in the binance authentication that makes that possible somehow but I can not proof that.",

            "text": "So I've been working on this project for about 2 months now, and I've learned quite a bit about how new listings behave, and how important the Binance Annoucement page is.\n\nMy inital idea was to create a crypto trading bot in Python, that constantly checks if a new listing is added on Binance, essentially by checking the total number of coins at any given time. I tried out different variations on this, end even increased the speed to buy within 0.1 seconds on a new coin being listed.\n\nAfter looking at the results, and talking to some of you on here, it turns out that the spike in the price upon listing the coin is actually the peak of the iceberg.\n\nThe real activity seems to happen once Binance Announces that they will list the coin, and not upon the listing itself.\n\nHave a look at the chart for FIDA/USDT below, and the time Binance made the announcement:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[FIDA\\/USDT](https://preview.redd.it/632lzb5vb1u71.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=fadf32882611d301c4f3fafb12a1f6a3803d90e0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mt8w8g6wb1u71.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=28dea318dee3dd6047214f159b068c57168589d5\n\nLooks like people are fomoing hard into new coins on different exchanges in anticipation of a Binance pump, ironically creating the pump themselves.\n\nSo with that in mind, I built a crypto trading algorithm that listens to the Binance announcement page, and once there is an announcement for a new coin listing, the bot extracts the symbol of that coin and places a Buy order on Gate .io.\n\nThe tool will automatically place buy and sell orders and it has a trailing stop loss feature, meaning that it should sell at the optimum time, in theory.\n\nI chose gate .io because according to what I've seen and what some of you have said, this exchange seem to list many of the coins that later make it on Binance or other bigger exchanges.\n\nThe tool is free to use for everyone, but I suggest running it in Test mode at first, as I still need to confirm that everything runs fine. Annoyingly, gate .io doesn't have a testnet which means I had to test the buy/sell logic by placing real trades - not ideal.\n\nBut I've included a test mode for the tool itself, so it won't actually call the gate .io API, it will just simulate the trades locally.\n\nI'm currently waiting for new annoucements to test out the profitability and will report back. For anyone interested in the project or who may want to test this out themselves:\n\n**Here's a video overview of the tool and why it evolved to this:** [**https://youtu.be/SsSgD0v16Kg**](https://youtu.be/SsSgD0v16Kg)\n\n**A guide on how to install and run this on your machine:** [**https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/10/17/a-binance-and-gate-io-crypto-trading-bot-for-new-coin-announcements/**](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/10/17/a-binance-and-gate-io-crypto-trading-bot-for-new-coin-announcements/)\n\n**And of course, the source code on GitHub:** [**https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/gateio-crypto-trading-bot-binance-announcements-new-coins**](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/gateio-crypto-trading-bot-binance-announcements-new-coins)",

I tried with a limit order (not market, because that\u2019s very risky) and received an error that my buying price was too low.\n\nTurns out the presale was at 0.1, so I placed an order on 0.2, in case someone wanted to double their money. That way, I\u2019d buy at 0.2, but maybe I could sell at 0.4!\n\nWhat happened was, the price went instantly to $3 and my buy order was rejected (API error).\n\nSo I learnt that there are 2 types of announcements. New coins (first time listing) and existing coins. For existing coins, as soon as the announcement is made, the price quickly rises.\n\nSo I decide to scrape the announcements page (I built a Telegram bot to send me a message too) every few seconds, and then find what exchange has the coin.\n\nIt is a bit tricky because the pair could be IOTA/USDT or USDT/IOTA to put an example.\n\nSo you have to consider both cases and adjust your base and quote amounts, prices etc.\n\nAnd yes, one of the exchanges I found better suited for the task was Gate io\n\nUnfortunately I didn\u2019t quite finish the bot, so I haven\u2019t tried it yet. I am also trying to detect pumps from Telegram groups and buy early. So there\u2019s a few bots I\u2019m working on.\n\nAnyway, I expect a lot of competing bots, even with this technique. That being said, I will save your post, to take a look in the future in case I can learn something. Next post you\u2019re probably going to go further than I\u2019ve ever gone, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how it goes. Good luck \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffd",

Not accepting the offer at the moment, as if I do I will have to discharge any claims against them. Looking for the justice and a total compensation. Please contact me if you have any legal advice.\n\nORIGINAL POST:\nDue to Binance serious technical mistake on 19th of May 2021 I have lost $70k+, but can't get Binance to respond for over 4 days. Binance admitted that it is THEIR mistake on few reddit posts, but there is no official announcement from them. Those who were lucky to receive an answer from them are offered 3 times less USDT vouchers, than was initially lost.\n\nThis post is my story. Please upvote it, share it and participate in case you are affected.  \nPlease help me to make Binance answer.\n\nInformation about BLVT - [https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-binance-leveraged-tokens-blvt](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-binance-leveraged-tokens-blvt)\n\n Binance leveraged tokens are not the same as the leverage. Binance advertise them as a token without liquidation, but at the same time they dropped up to 99% which technically means the liquidation in this case (false advertising). \n\n**tldr;** In the evening of 18th of May bought Binance Leveraged Tokens (TRXUP, XLMUP, 1INCHUP, XRPUP) for around $110k and total value of all of them is now less than $15k. This is despite Binance\u2019s claims that BLVTs maintain a target leverage in the 1.25-4x range, the real leverage at times of rebalancing exceeded 20x (up to 220x) during the overall crypto fall on 19th of May. \n\nThis caused a loss of $70k+. While almost all BLVT tokens were -95-99% Binance froze them for maintenance for 5 hours meaning rate of those tokens remained the same even when the market went up. The rates of BLVT tokens are still not fixed.  \n\nI've written to every single channel Binance has yet haven't received a response for over 4 days.  \nMy trading volume for last 30 days is around 100BTC (had VIP1 status before selling my BNBs before the 18th of May).\n\nLooking for\n\n1. reply from Binance with an official statement (stop ignoring me)\n2. 100% compensation of all lost funds (I am losing even more every day because  I can not close positions, as it is the only proof to get compensated).\n3. other traders who lost their funds due to Binance technical mistake. Attach your story with screenshots in this post. Together we are strong.\n4. attorneys who are interested in this lawsuit. We need your legal assistance. Binance is obviously is wrong in this case. As minimum of false advertising. \n\nPlease contact me or join Binance Lawsuit [reddit.com/r/binance\\_lawsuit](http://reddit.com/r/binance_lawsuit)\n\nHere is the letter describing the problem in details which has been ignored by Binance for over 4 days:\n\n  \n\\----------  \n\n\nTo the persons responsible for Binance Leveraged Tokens, customer support and the finance department,\n\nI am writing about a serious issue with the rebalancing mechanism inherent in Binance Leveraged Tokens (BLVTs). Despite Binance\u2019s claims that BLVTs maintain a target leverage in the 1.25-4x range, the real leverage at times of rebalancing exceeded 20x in the following tokens:\n\n* TRXUP\n* XLMUP\n* 1INCHUP\n* XRPUP (not 20x but still not correct calculation) \n\nFurthermore, real leverage was also below target on numerous occasions for all these tokens. I have attached screenshots of the Rebalancing History pages for the respective tokens to confirm this:\n\n* [https://imgur.com/TehwU39](https://imgur.com/TehwU39) \n* [https://imgur.com/5nI2ZVt](https://imgur.com/5nI2ZVt) \n* [https://imgur.com/RZK1OTi](https://imgur.com/RZK1OTi) \n* [https://imgur.com/SXr2IkE](https://imgur.com/SXr2IkE) \n* [https://imgur.com/qfQCWbj](https://imgur.com/qfQCWbj) \n* [https://imgur.com/9jKL9SZ](https://imgur.com/9jKL9SZ) \n* [https://imgur.com/a1M2H0d](https://imgur.com/a1M2H0d) \n* [https://imgur.com/qGqRwsr](https://imgur.com/qGqRwsr) \n* [https://imgur.com/aWzQxLt](https://imgur.com/aWzQxLt) \n* [https://imgur.com/yN1CbhD](https://imgur.com/yN1CbhD)   \n\n\nSaid flaw in the rebalancing mechanism has caused a $70k loss across 4 of my positions (TRXUP, XLMUP, INCHUP, XRPUP), stemming from the heightened leverage during a downward price action in the underlying assets and the watered-down leverage during an upswing in their price. The positions of many others were similarly affected \u2013 these users have expressed their concerns and disgust in the following social media posts:\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/nilyem/binance\\_leveraged\\_tokens\\_advisory\\_notice\\_may\\_22/](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/nilyem/binance_leveraged_tokens_advisory_notice_may_22/)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/ng8peq/ethdown\\_class\\_action\\_lawsuit\\_binance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/ng8peq/ethdown_class_action_lawsuit_binance/) \n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/ngfrul/binance\\_leveraged\\_tokens\\_are\\_literally\\_a\\_scam/](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/ngfrul/binance_leveraged_tokens_are_literally_a_scam/) \n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/ng8urz/spoke\\_with\\_a\\_lawyer\\_about\\_binances\\_issues\\_that/](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/ng8urz/spoke_with_a_lawyer_about_binances_issues_that/) \n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/ng770i/to\\_anyone\\_freaking\\_out\\_about\\_leveraged\\_tokens\\_im/](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/ng770i/to_anyone_freaking_out_about_leveraged_tokens_im/) \n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/ngh5k1/how\\_is\\_this\\_possible\\_eth\\_updown\\_all\\_red/](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/ngh5k1/how_is_this_possible_eth_updown_all_red/) \n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/ngf655/lost\\_175000\\_because\\_of\\_this\\_shit\\_what\\_should\\_i\\_do/](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/ngf655/lost_175000_because_of_this_shit_what_should_i_do/) \n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/nge537/adadown\\_is\\_down\\_78\\_i\\_bought\\_before\\_the\\_crash\\_look/](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/nge537/adadown_is_down_78_i_bought_before_the_crash_look/) \n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/ngak2a/binance\\_leveraged\\_tokens\\_are\\_not\\_what\\_they\\_appear/](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/ngak2a/binance_leveraged_tokens_are_not_what_they_appear/) \n\nTo make matters worse, I received a suspension notice in response to my Binance Support ticket where I have attempted to address the issue with BLVTs. The suspension is based on the claim that I have accessed Binance from a restricted country, which Estonia is not. As a result, I supposedly have less than 48 hours to close my positions and move the assets out of Binance to avoid losing access to them forever. I believe this is completely unjustified and unfair and resembles an attempt to force me to close my positions before erasing any evidence there is about the trades.\n\nIn light of the above, I demand that Binance:\n\n1. Terminate the suspension notice and cease the process of offboarding my account,\n\n2. Issue me a refund of the difference between the value that my positions in 1INCHUP, XLMUP, TRXUP should be (based on the correctly functioning rebalancing mechanism) and their current value\n\n3. Fix the rebalancing mechanism for the 1INCHUP, XLMUP, TRXUP and other BLVTs that have been correctly identified by the public as to be working incorrectly.  \n\nI am willing to settle this issue amicably, but I am ready to go to court and join a class lawsuit if needed. I have been a very active customer on Binance with over 100 BTC in trading volume in the past month, and believe that I have been seriously wronged in these instances. I am looking forward to you addressing this matter asap.\n\nMy user id is 13796605, my Binance Case IDs are #72639282 and #72719777.\n\nI have also submitted compensation claim with Appeal ID: \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*65576198\n\nLooking forward to the response from Binance.    \n\n\n\\----------  \n\n\nBinance, you are the biggest crypto exchange on the market and we expect appropriate actions.\n\nWord of mouth is a strong power, it will destroy your company image, and I will make everything to speed up the process of spreading the information.\n\nThose of us who have been affected will not let this situation just simply vanish.\n\n\\----------\n\nBinance Community Moderators are recommended to not remove this post. The removal of this post may be a form of client deterrence (preventing clients from receiving their appropriate entitlement and disadvantaging the client from their benefit).",

I mean even if you catch it middle moon shot, that candle slams on brakes AS SOON as u hit buy. Happens every damn time. Also had 1.2k just disappear when doge was doing it's crazy run a few weeks back. Entered a position with 25% of my holdings in isolated mode and when I closed it, after only a 10% loss, the whole balance in my futures disappeared. I wasnt liquidated, not even close to it. When I messaged support thru chat they said \"Doge is moving very violent right now\".... duhhhhh why u think I'm trading that poocoin. But doge moving \"violently\" has nothing to do with the unused profits in my futures wallet that weren't in trade, was in isolated mode, and shouldn't have went anywhere even if my position was liquidated, which it wasnt, beings I was in isolated mode and the 10% loss I took on the close wasnt no where near what i lost. Im not stupid, with the immediate PNL line resistance and missing money when doge movement is raping their coffers,  it seems like theres a \"bug\" in the system to make the market on your screen do exactly the opposite of what you're trying to do. We need a way to simultaneously compare charts and prices while we have a trade open and see if we arent each getting custom tailored charts and prices to take our money... it cant be a coincidence every damn time, after a few in a row it's by design. Just like when the whole damn trade history box is red with huge trades, 95% are huge sells and 5% are small buys, but the damn price just keeps shooting up like a rocket. They must think we are stupid",

But it's pretty bad.  I waited in the BiBi Queue for around SIX HOURS, and luckily checked back on my computer just as I got to #8 in the queue.\n\nHell, if you want, I will send an email on your behalf.

Thats why the safest thing is get a seperate checking account and only transfer funds to it when u need funds to buy... one you buy, your crypto account specifically for checking should be empty and then you have funds in whatever exchange wallet. Take them immediately out f that wallet to a secure wallet. Many types of secure wallets exist people just need an education on this!",

            "text": "It's been over a month now since I initially shared with you a tool that I had made in order to quickly buy into a new coin listing to take advantage of the initial surge in the price.\n\nTesting this algorithm out has been a real pain since I had to wait for a new coin to be listed each time, and only find that the script breaks or underperforms. But after all this trial and error I finally did it!\n\nBefore I go explaining how the tool works as well as its performance, let me explain why I think that this particular strategy has some potential:\n\nAs some of you may have noticed, many coins seem to go through to what I would like to call a \"lightning-pump\" during their first few seconds of being listed on an exchange.\n\nHave a look at ICP\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ggmdzaatbvm71.png?width=2650&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a7fa3fa9b9bd3a62c171512c8f4bc2508f00147\n\nIn under a minute, the price of ICP shot up over 10 times, before slowly dipping into the void. Manually trading this 10x would be impossible, due to the speed required to catch this pump.\n\nSo I decided I want to take advantage of this lightning pump by buying at the listing price and selling at the peak. I built a bot that would detect a new coin listing within 20 seconds, and improved it until it reached a speed of 0.1 seconds to place a trade from the moment a new coin is listed.\n\nThough even with this speed, it would pretty much buy at the top and sell a few % later. This is when I had the idea to reverse the orders. If we're catching a coin at its peak that doesn't mean we can't make a good profit with the tool.\n\nSo I decided to configure the bot to place margin sell orders instead - and lo and behold it's now actually making a profit on new coin listings by placing sell orders and then quickly closing the position - all in under 1 second.\n\nWhat's mindblowing here is that it made 11% profit on a stablecoin listing. I didn't see this one coming I admit. It placed a sell order on USDP at 1.18 and old it at 1.05, go figure. There's still room for improvement but I'm very happy that for now it seems to be profitable. USDP chart below for reference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ebqnlt9vbvm71.png?width=2343&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fe967c7561f4986728fc1223c19b9f8f56b9123\n\nI'll keep running it and see how it performs on regular coins, and report back with more results.\n\nFor anyone interested in trying it out, I've included a test mode that will simulate placing orders so there's no risk involved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**For those of you who asked for a youtube video explaining everything in more detail:** [**https://youtu.be/h5xVXotTeE8**](https://youtu.be/h5xVXotTeE8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here's a step by step guide on how to build it as well as an in-depth anatomy of the code:**\n\n[https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/08/15/coding-a-binance-trading-bot-that-detects-new-coins-the-moment-they-are-listed/](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/08/15/coding-a-binance-trading-bot-that-detects-new-coins-the-moment-they-are-listed/)\n\n**For the GitHub source code please go here:**\n\n[https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/binance-trading-bot-new-coins](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/binance-trading-bot-new-coins)\n\nIf you have any ideas on how to improve the stability or the speed of the code, please feel free to submit a PR.",

Every time I would start the algorithm, I would have to wait there for days at a time before it does anything. Then Binance decides to list a new coin, and the script breaks. Go in and fix the error, re-start the script.\n\nRinse and repeat this a few times over two weeks, it was tedious and required a lot of patience but I fucking did it. I can now confidently call the script functional (with some minor bugs that I will fix in the coming days).\n\n**So here's what actually happened:**\n\nThe algorithm detected GNO as a new listing yesterday at 6:00AM UTC, and placed a buy order at 6:00.02. The order was placed at 394 USDT and GNO peaked at 418 but the entry price was closer to 300.\n\nIt seems that even with 0.2s speed of execution the tool is still too slow to buy at the listed price and needs additional improvements.\n\nIt ended up selling at 3% loss - which might not seem like an achievement, but I am personally very happy with the fact that it actually works, and this gives me a good base to make the necessary improvements in order to optimise this strategy.\n\nI do think that, if optimised correctly this tool can actually work very well. I will keep making improvements and report back. \n\nIf you're curious to know more about how the bot works and how this buy order performed, I just made a new video explaining all of that in more detail: [**https://youtu.be/kWndcvWuMzI**](https://youtu.be/kWndcvWuMzI)\n\n**And for those who asked for the guide, here you go:** [https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/08/15/coding-a-binance-trading-bot-that-detects-new-coins-the-moment-they-are-listed/](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/08/15/coding-a-binance-trading-bot-that-detects-new-coins-the-moment-they-are-listed/)",

On March 10th I made a purchase of $25 usd on VET everything went through fine without a hiccup. Next few hours go by I transferred BITCOIN into my account from COINBASE. Guess what I got it without a failure ASAP. Later on I tried to sell off a Portion of MY BITCOIN to by FIAT and invest on more VET at the time was 0.0346cent per token. AFTER THAT ATTEMPT MY ACCOUNT WAS TEMPORARILY DISABLED ON MARCH 10TH. So like any other human being I submitted a ticket. I got a email from them saying to submit Photo and video and repeat a few lines. Upon receiving that first email I quickly received another email stating disregard the previous email we have received your video statement. It get BETTER so on the 17th of March I received a message saying I owe them money for a CHARGEBACK. From March 3rd but didn't say anything about the amount. I seen on the app it said 250. The email said my balance was in the negative due chargeback that if I make payment ill be able to have my account enabled again. Yeah \ud83d\udc4c I IMMEDIATELY upon receiving the email go and TRY TO MAKE A PAYMENT JUST TO BE FREE. NO SIR I HAVE OVER 5 CARDS NOT 1 WOULD DEPOSIT. Mind you I ONLY used 1 account for this platform CHIME statement does not show any CHARGEBACK of 250. SMH \ud83d\udca9 LONG STORY SHORT I'M STILL LOCKED OUT OF MY ACCOUNT... 515363 511807...

I've tried and tested an answer that I came across on Coin Bureau, and it works! \n\nThis is through Revolut, you open an account with them and this gives you a sort code/ACC no etc. You then set up a virtual card which is done in seconds. Once you have set up this virtual card you can transfer money into your revolut acc from your bank and then buy crypto directly on Binance with these card details... All in all this cost me \u00a32. Just thought I would share in case any other people were having similar issues, it currently works well but for how long is anyone's guess.",

The fees are ridiculous though because if I wanted to buy \u00a31,000 worth of anything, it's a straight \u00a338\\~ fee using a credit card.\n\nUK buyers are getting hard shafted by their banks. I'm with Barclays and Coinbase only accept credit card with me for some reason. I've asked them why I can't link my bank, but they say they \"can't disclose that information.\" which means I can't buy using pro version. I read Barclays have stopped their business with Coinbase so that could be the reason why I can't link my bank. (Still can use card though..)\n\nI also can't buy using credit card with Binance since Barclays blocks the payment and I've been getting kinda nervous after reading about people getting their accounts closed because they keep buying crypto and don't want that happening as it'll just be a huge pain.\n\nI've seen people suggest using P2P on Binance and I haven't tried it yet so that could be a viable way if you do bank transfer because a lot of the people say not to mention anything about crypto in the reference so there is no way the bank would know, right? Obviously you'd have to be careful with scams and stuff though. It kinda just seems shady though...Not the P2P stuff, I mean the going behind my own banks back to try and hide investing in crypto like I'm breaking the law or something even though it's my money. lol",

            "text": "It's been over 3 months of learning, testing and coding since I first started this project, and I am really excited to share this latest update with you.\n\n**But first, just a bit of context on the project:**\n\nMy inital idea was to create a crypto trading bot in Python, that constantly checks if a new listing is added on Binance, essentially by checking the total number of coins at any given time. I tried out different variations on this, end even increased the speed to buy within 0.1 seconds on a new coin being listed.\n\nThe initial idea that I had, was to create a crypt trading bot in Python that looks at the Binance Announcement page, and places buy orders on new listings the moment they become available. The reason behind that is that a lot of new listings spike up a lot in the initial moments of the listing.\n\nI later realised that this spike originates outside of the Binance exchange, not at the time that Binance lists the coin, but rather, the moment they announce that they will list the coin.\n\nHere's an example of it:\n\n[CHESS](https://preview.redd.it/9ik2kayg8lz71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6b493dbbd78abd278d78f759fdd18d9e06303cf)\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/crcghe2i8lz71.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=f247188850af13d5ae6373fa622e4ec9d1236077](https://preview.redd.it/crcghe2i8lz71.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=f247188850af13d5ae6373fa622e4ec9d1236077)\n\nRight so with the strategy all nailed down, it took about another month of testing and optimisation before the bot would do anything interesting. But here we are, 3 months later with a functional trading bot that seems to be making decent gains on new listings (though it can be improved).\n\n**The results (so far):**\n\nSo bear in mind that this only includes the latest iteration of the bot, before this update the bot was not profitable.\n\n[10% on MOVR listing](https://preview.redd.it/41zi3c3u8lz71.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=a74750722a8d210eb124159cd1fb879fc329f39a)\n\n[25% on ENS listing](https://preview.redd.it/t07pst819lz71.png?width=1578&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d5ec2f8188c2a5ef8bbeb4de21175df7bd26fa2)\n\nIt's still super early to tell whether the bot will be consistently profitable, but it's looking rather promising so far. The tool comes with a test mode so you can test it out without throwing real money at it.\n\nI would also like to thank everyone who has contributed to the codebase on GitHub, these profits would have not been possible without your amazing contributions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If you want to find out more about how it all works, and how the tool became profitable:** [https://youtu.be/4gul6AqAoEo](https://youtu.be/4gul6AqAoEo)\n\nI also made a guide, so you can use this if you want to install and run this bot yourself. It comes with a test mode, so you don't have to throw real money at it:\n\n[https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/10/17/a-binance-and-gate-io-crypto-trading-bot-for-new-coin-announcements/](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/10/17/a-binance-and-gate-io-crypto-trading-bot-for-new-coin-announcements/)\n\nSource code available here [https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/gateio-crypto-trading-bot-binance-announcements-new-coins](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/gateio-crypto-trading-bot-binance-announcements-new-coins)",

I understand how that is done and why.\n\nBut it's much more productive for trading, and easier for day to day life, to keep my assets in the Binance spot wallet.\n\nActually, I am thinking to move much more of my money into Binance. Inflation is killing my Fiat anyway.\n\nBut I wonder if this is really as risky as people say. I don't see the chance of Binance getting hacked bigger than the chance of my actual Bank getting hacked. Binance makes so much money that they probably have a level of security that touches the sky. And as long as I keep my 2FA and don't fall into phishing traps, I will be fine.\n\nThe only potential issue I see is, a normal Bank is more regulated and I have the guarantee that a certain amount of my money will be recovered even if the Bank disappears. With Binance, if it disappears... I guess I will lose everything.\n\nBut... does such a chance exist at all? Is it greater than the chance of the whole society collapsing anyway?\n\nCONCLUSION AFTER READING YOUR AWESOME COMMENTS:\n\nBinance is pretty secure. But: it will sometimes turn off withdrawals for certain coins (you can still trade though), they sometimes lock/freeze accounts for unknown reasons and their support/communication is not the best.\n\nIt's good to keep your trading money in there but it's objectively safer to put your HODL and staking money out into a self owned wallet. If you don't like cold wallets you should at least spread your assets into multiple exchanges.\n\nAnd, always remember: \"Not your keys, not your coins\".",

Something of an epic proportion must happen for Binance to collapse (personal opinion I must note). For as long as you safeguard your passphrase, maintain 2FA, add whitelist addresses for withdrawl you should be ok. My personal preference is to keep some portion of my portfolio on Binance, some in my cold wallet, some in crypto banks. Verdict - probability of losing money is fairly slim.",

They have disabled my account without giving a single reason, the support refuses to give me an explanation hoping that they \"do not know\" what is happening, they only know that I have the withdrawals disabled. So I wonder how they intend my withdrawals to be re-enabled if not even Binance knows why they are disabled? I'm contacting support every day, they tell me \"Be careful, I'll get news soon\" ... but I don't get a response and this Reddit channel is my last hope.\n\nBecause of this, not being able to access MY money, I lost a unique business opportunity that could have meant a change for my life, however, it can no longer be because of the ineffectiveness of binance. Also, I couldn't take advantage of buying $ CRO at 0.41 which is worth 0.72 at the time I made this comment on Reddit. I could have had a 40% profit ... however thanks Binance I couldn't.\n\nMy trust in Binance has faded, I am not willing to store my money on this platform once my case is resolved (if at all). It is the second time this has happened to me, I am afraid to even continue using binance which should not be the case because Binance is supposed to give us security, integrity and calm when entrusting our money to it.\n\nIn case anyone at binance really cares that I can get my money back ... my case number is # 79719120",

At first I was told the card was declined even though I had enough balance on the card. However the amount was still deducted from the account. And now I\u2019m stucked with how to get my money refunded. The airline says the card was declined so there\u2019s nothing they can do about it. Binance support says the payment was made so there\u2019s nothing they can do about it. Normally if it was a bank they\u2019d just reverser the transaction and then I\u2019ll get make my money. But when dealing with Binance they don\u2019t really care!\n\nEdit: so eventually Binance support contacted me again and has initiated a process to refund the money. This should take about 7 days.

If that's true the bot would buy this coin on gate .io.\n\nIt works like this because I've observed that coins spike up in price upon listing. Have a look at the time this coin spiked, and the announcement timestamp:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[CHESS\\/USDT](https://preview.redd.it/lefqyvzx8mw71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=01be916c88fa15fe7189066465f865113d105d29)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6vuaq4z8mw71.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=018020270038655e488bb01552b7a0da9e901338\n\nYou can clearly see in the image above that the coin started pumping on other exchanges at 03:36 - exactly when the announcement was made.\n\nNow here's the thing though - It's actually possible that Binance is backdating this announcement timestamp. Accoring to the bot that me and everyone else who happened to run my bot at this time, the bot detected this announcement 5 minutes later at 03:41.\n\nEveryone who was running my bot at that time confirmed the same thing. I've inspected my code and there's nothing to show that it would have been delayed. The bot was checking this page normally every 10 seconds.\n\nNot a lot of results online, but sure enough someone came accross the same issue 5 months ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/50schtc09mw71.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fad71b9d683ca8415bfe40b88ccbf2ec5a1d9ec\n\nI don't want to accuse Binance of anything but it's interesting that the coin peaks within the first 5 minutes, and everyone else who enters past this time, they are not able to make a profit on this.\n\nSomeone must be making a profit, the question is who? If you came across this issue, please let me know what your conclusion was.\n\nIn anticipation of another \"delay\" the bot now has a lot more logging installed so we can all understand what exactly is going on on their page. (thank you to everyone who contributed to the codebase!)\n\nIf you want to test this tool yourself (comes with a test mode) here is a step by step tutorial:\n\n[https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/10/17/a-binance-and-gate-io-crypto-trading-bot-for-new-coin-announcements/](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/10/17/a-binance-and-gate-io-crypto-trading-bot-for-new-coin-announcements/)\n\nIf you're curious to find out how the bot performed on the new coin listing, you can watch the video here: [https://youtu.be/H2ylujgbDzw](https://youtu.be/H2ylujgbDzw)",

DEX can get around it because it's \"decentralized\" and thus no one entity is controlling it and thus can't be solely held responsible.",

It offers so many possibilities. it really felt great, useful, rapid, efficient.Then i joined here to ask for some infos on different points like Liquidity Swap pool.\n\nAnd then i was exposed to this massiv negativity and i directly thought that i needed to fear Binance and go somewhere else. So i joined coinbase pro, i was less happy with the overall exchange/app. But i used it and i needed some infos. So i joined the reddit, asked my questions and.... Same negativity.\n\nThat's when i understood that, people are louder when they have problems, so you feel like there's only that. But no exchange is perfect, the huge amount of new people that join crypto everyday. that needs support either because they joined without learning, or because they have a true problem. And i feel you guys, i hope the best for anyone having issues anywhere.\n\nBut if you're new and scared that Binance is a monster that will block you and keep your money... 99.9% chance that this will never happen. They have laws to follow like any classic bank. If you trust your bank you can trust Binance almost the same way.Myself and people i know had some issues, and Binance support was fast and efficient. But why would we post that here with a big title ?\n\nAs you should not trust directly anyone shilling a crypto currency, try to learn by yourself why Binance isn't that atrocious exchange. If you're still not sure, learn about that other exchange you're using. You'll see that the most common issue is a lack of support: as i said, a lot of people are joining in the crypto boat is this bull period.Maybe like you did.\n\nYou can trust Binance, maybe more than most exchanges. Withdraw what you can in a wallet, to limit your stress about it. Not your keys not your coins.\n\nI hope the best for those who need assistance and i can only affirm that you'll end up getting your funds back.\n\nKeep it safe, and hodl until you get that lambo.",

Except they aren't a bank, they don't even have a headquarters and in my opinion are a ghost company. Some sources say that they are located in Malta which is a safe heaven for company's but the Malta government issues that they aren't there.  \n\n\nSo just like ThePirateBay Binance doesn't exist except on the internet.   \n\n\nOP is saying they are following a law. I doubt that if there isn't a law you have to follow if you are in international digital space.  \n\n\nI don't like paranoid posts about how users are shills so i'm giving OP the good side of my doubt about his goal with this post.",

They are definitely overcrowded, we should accept delays and long waiting.  But simply there are things which I can not understand. Some easy solutions and ideas to make customers treated well are not something out or reach for worldwide new tech corporation. I will make a list of things which should be wall of shame for big company, even considering they are overcrowded or whatever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Mail support closed. Why? Nowadays the only way to reach support is chat. It is not friendly because you have to wait in a queue for 3-4 days, when you were so unlucky that you fell asleep because it is a night in your area or went to the toilet or your dog heavily needs a walk or whatever... you have lost your place. No chance for mail answer, even though you left your mail for contact and bot advised that you can leave a message and support will give you a reply by mail. So you can again start waiting in a new queue, hoping this time you will be more lucky.\n\nThe idea for chat support is the idea for quite fast answer for a customer. So when support is overcrowded, it is completely nonsense. Better activate mail support, send automative response with number of ticket and info about estimate time reply (ok I understand it might take time).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.  When you were so lucky you have support on the chat. You get info that he needs time for reading your \"case\". You described your case with details. The answer is to reset your 2FA while the main problem is that you can't access your account. Enclosed printscreen shows a probable bug, but the answer is that he can't see any error on the snapshot.\n\nSo even though you are a calm person, how can you keep calm when you feel as if mediocre inteligence chimpanzee could serve you better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3.  Finally support admits that can't help, so: \"The ticket will be sent to your mailbox right away after this chat ends\". Hours have passed and no ticket in your mailbox.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4.  I suggested that there is a some bug, more users have same problem, look at this thread:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/lzsod4/yubikey\\_problem\\_illegal\\_parameter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/lzsod4/yubikey_problem_illegal_parameter/)\n\nNo interest in Binance side when you can help them finding some bug and give contact to other users, experiencing the same problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI might continue but should be enough. Do you really think this problems could not be solved better, even though they are overcrowded???",

            "text": "BNB had a spectacular run in the last couple of days but rather than viewing this as a speculative event, you should see it more as a convergence to BNB's *intrinsic value* which is a minimum of $700 right now.\n\nLet's analyze it a bit further:\n\n\\-> BNB has a total of 176M outstanding tokens including all locked tokens and across BSC and regular chain\n\n\\-> Team tokens amount to 53M unlocked + 16M still locked = 69M. Adresses are here:\n\n[https://twitter.com/cz\\_binance/status/1351530231429955586](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1351530231429955586)\n\nand the 16M locked are here:\n\n[https://explorer.binance.org/address/bnb1ultyhpw2p2ktvr68swz56570lgj2rdsadq3ym2](https://explorer.binance.org/address/bnb1ultyhpw2p2ktvr68swz56570lgj2rdsadq3ym2)\n\n\\-> Binance CEX does 40BN of daily spot. Assuming 50% of users take advantage of reduced fees we get around $60M in fees per day paid using BNB or 200,000 BNB at $300 price point. **Note we are completely disregarding the futures market which is also substantial in its own right and charges quite a lot of fees**.\n\n\\-> BSC is using around 5,000 BNB per day in TX fees\n\n\\-> Regular chain is using around 700 BNB per day in TX fees\n\n\\-> BSC requires voting power and right now 3.3M BNB are tied to voting power. **These are not going anywhere as long as BSC exists and will most likely increase over time.**\n\n\\-> Quarterly burns are now burning around $160M. It will probably be more next time but let's assume its $160M. Also they are burning around 50% from team allocation and 50% from Binance balances. $160M is around 533,000 BNB every 3 months at $300 per BNB\n\nSo that leaves 69,000,000+3,300,000+(200,000+5000+700)\\*365+533,000\\*4/2 = **148.3M BNB per year that are simply not available to the market due to being tied up in applications**. Meaning the network ALREADY uses **148.3M BNB fixed in place just to exist at the current price point**. This usage is just hidden. Team tokens are essentially off the market as they they never sold a single one. Just check the addresses if you don't believe me.\n\nBut what about other allocations? CZ is a BNB holder and although he never discussed his holdings in detail it is estimated to be at least 5M BNB which makes it **153M BNB tied up** which means there are only **23M to actually trade and hold for every single market user.** That's 23M for every single crypto user and considering that Binance alone has over 100M users if I recall correctly, that isn't a lot of BNB to go around. **And that number is decreasing with every burn**.\n\nNow look at all the tied up cases for BNB. Only 2 are affected by price point: tokens burns and use in Binance CEX. If BNB price doubles, use in CEX is reduced to 100,000 BNB a day and tokens burns to 217,000 every 3 months. This frees up **37M BNB a year if price doubles to $600**\n\nSo a price doubling brings a release of 37+23 = 60M of BNB available to actually use **if price is $600**\n\nNow assume BNB captures just 20% of ETH DeFi market (a conservative estimate since BSC TVL is already above that). That's $8BN. If we apply a ratio of TVL to Market Cap for ETH we get 40,000,000/224,000,000 = 0.178\n\nNow apply the same metric to BNB but remember we only have 23M tokens available at $300 or 60M at $600\n\n8,000,000/0.178 = $44Bn market cap\n\nwhich leads to **44B/60M = $698 per BNB**\n\n**So TLDR: on use cases alone that are already 100% implemented and assuming near zero growth of BSC and other all other applications BNB is worth close to $700 at this very moment.**\n\n**Disclaimer: This is not investment advice.**",

I'm using Binance since 2017 I had no problem in any way and I supported them in anywhere that I was talking about crypto world and what they do is really helping the community...\n\nAfter the long bear market I decided to add a sell order today and boom I saw this message:\n\n\" Dear User, as per our Terms of Use, we are unable to provide services to your account going forward. We appreciate your continued support.\"\n\nI know they gave me an option to withdraw my money but my point is I never did something fishy and my account is verified with my info. I guess the reason is because I'm from Iran. I don't really care what my government does. we already under pressure with so many economic problems and its sad to see crypto that supposed to be above governments,borders and limitation is being limited by a big company like Binance that is a pioneer in the crypto world. Does anyone care to explain rather than copying the same message guys? is it really fair what you do to to your loyal customer based on where they born not what they do? :)",

It's in their best interest as a company to refuse service to countries under sanctions, otherwise they to may be put into the same basket and blocked from all other countries.\n\nYou may not approve of what your country does, but you're in it.

Essentially, as long as the price of the coin is going up, the algo will hold onto the coin, and sell once it detects a trend reversal.\n\nI'm sure many of you have noticed the phenomenon of massive pumps the moment a new asset is listed on Binance, only to be followed by a significant drop afterwards. Manually trading that would be impossible, but a trading bot might be able to capitalize on some sweet gains there.\n\nIt comes with a test mode too so you can plug it in and let it run without any risk of using real money as you're testing it.\n\nThe bot is written in Python and works with Binance and Binance US.\n\nI've been testing it for a couple of days, but no coins have been listed on Binance since then, but I will continue testing it and report back. Though every function has been individually tested in the past and proven to work from some of my other projects. So please bear that in mind if you give it a go yourself.\n\nFor a detailed guide on how it all works, or to just follow along the code go here: [https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/08/15/coding-a-binance-trading-bot-that-detects-new-coins-the-moment-they-are-listed/](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/08/15/coding-a-binance-trading-bot-that-detects-new-coins-the-moment-they-are-listed/)\n\nAnd for the GitHub source go here:\n\n[https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/binance-trading-bot-new-coins](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/binance-trading-bot-new-coins)",

What I need is a simple bot that I can connect and not touch it for a year or two. I don\u2019t want to create my own trading system, just don\u2019t know how to do this and frankly don\u2019t care.\n\nThese companies have ready-to-use bots:\n\n* Cryptohopper\n* 3commas\n* Tradesanta\n\nBut each has like hundreds of different bots! They all cost about the same and have similar features. Really confused about how to select the best bot\u2026 Have you used any of these bots? Are they any good? Thanks!\n\n**Update:** I tried [**Stoic**](https://cindicator.com/stoic) and the results are pretty good so far. Everything's seamless and it works like a charm! Their UI is also very easy to use and navigate, and the forecasts are pretty much accurate. Can't say anything about the gains yet, since it's only been a week. Thanks for the heads up, u/bgb76!",

I just went with the highest ROI's ones and it's been working very well for me.\n\nSo yeah my results: it's only been 2 months now but I am VERY impressed with the results I got so far, far better then I expected and much more impressive than the other crypto bot's I was trying before ([cryptohoppe](https://www.cryptohopper.com/?atid=26596)r was also showing good results but takes more time to maintain - it might be worth checking out if you like to play with stuff more)",

What I know is that when applying for a passport or other official ID at least in some regions you have to visit an officer face to face so that they can verify that it's actually you. The video pretty much serves the same purpose. Like I mentioned, the ID video is required from non-twin customers as well in some situations. KYC photo with you holding your ID is quite common.",

The transaction is successfully completed and the funds appear to be on the address when we have a look at the Avalanche chain explorer. However, the deposits are not credited because Binance doesn\u2019t support the C-chain. According to Avelanche the funds could be easily send back from Binance to the holders if Binance makes an effort to import the deposit address in MetaMask and installs the custom RPC network of Avelanche. However, both customer support and support tickets have not been able to implement this solution since it would sidestep company procedure. But should that outweigh people not having access to their funds? \n\nAnother question is wether Binance could get in touch with Avelanche to support the C chain? Avelanche seems very willing to make that happen. Especially to prevent future complexities as such.\n\nWe hope to hear from you soon! We would love to have access to our funds and trade again :)\n\nSee link below to the Avax forum where several people share the same problem:\n\nhttps://forum.avax.network/t/sent-avax-from-avalanche-metamask-to-binance-but-did-not-receive/1528/15",

I've had my Binance.US account for a while now and it's been verified previously. I sent over all my information and everything was good to go. I was able to make deposits, withdrawals, etc. Then one day I go to try and make a deposit and all of a sudden my account is back to pending verification?  \nI reached out to support back on April 16th about this issue and I received no response from anyone, so I reached out again on May 4th and the following day I got an email from one of their support reps. She apologized for the delayed response and said that they have had an influx of customer responses over the past few weeks and their response is now usually a little bit longer than usual. That's fine, I understand things happen, but no one had reached out to me about my initial email so at this point I'm already a bit worried. She said that my ticket has been escalated to the appropriate team and that my ticket will be reviewed.  \nIt's now about to be June and I haven't heard back from the rep who reached out to me, nor anyone from Binance since then. I have already placed another ticket in regards to this verification issue and nothing yet. If my account needs to be verified for the 2nd time, my original documents should be on fine for them to review it again, or they can just easily email me and ask for me to provide the necessary documents, again, and I will gladly do that.  \nI am unable to make any deposits/withdrawals on my account even though it had already gone through the verification process and everything was already approved. How does this make any sense? And why is no one reaching out to me to help out with this issue??",

            "text": " \n\n# General Conclusion\n\nAPR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.\n\nBoth are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.\n\n# Definition\n\nAPR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.\n\nAPY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.\n\nWho uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.\n\n>Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.\n\n# What Are They Different?\n\n## APR\n\nFor example, a yield farming program offers an APR  \n of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  \n.\n\nOnce you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.\n\n### Formular\n\nAPR = r x N\n\nWhere:\n\nr: The interest rate of the year;\n\nN: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).\n\n## APY\n\nAPY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.\n\n>What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?\n\nIf you have an APR  \n of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  \n by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  \n.\n\nAssuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  \n and APY  \n of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.\n\n### Formular\n\nAPY = (1+r)\\^n - 1\n\nIn which:\n\nr: The interest rate of the period;\n\nn: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).\n\n# Awareness\n\nAs such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:\n\n* First, displaying APY  \n will produce a larger percentage than APR  \n, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.\n* Secondly, the APY  \n interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).\n\nToday we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n**TLDR**:\n\nUnderstanding the two terms of APR  \n and APY  \n becomes even more important in DeFi today, as nearly all protocols with yield farming fields display these numbers. Knowing them well is not only for understanding and executing different strategies and calculating real profits.",

I'm happy with the results. I got my coins and my USD.  \n\nWhat I think helped:\n\nI reposted a way shorter version of my situation (see below) on the CEO's [Binance.US](https://Binance.US) Twitter account. Under a very recent post and within 15 min of my post, the [binance.us](https://binance.us) twitter responded asking for a ticket number. Bad publicity. It took two weeks and I tested my account each day trying to withdraw and one day it just worked. So I started taking out all coins immediately. \n\nI got no email response about my ticket or when my account was enabled. So test your account, because I don't think they have time to tell you. Super stoked. \n\nPatience is not the problem - it was the lack of communication from customer support. There was zero communication until I went to Twitter. Insane. Thanks for the comments. I hope everyone has a great experience with crypto! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelp! Binance is holding my money/coins for no good reason for over 10 days! Trading and withdrawal disabled due to \"risk management.\"\n\nOn 02/23/21 received \u201cAccount Action Needed\u201d email from Binance stating unable to process $500 deposit.\n\nReceived a second email on 02/23/21 \u201cAccount Action Needed\u201d email asking for a deposit of $500 within 7 days to bring the account in good standing. At the time of their request, there was $4,294.65 USD (and still is).\n\nOn 02/24/21, I submitted a ticket (#429664) explaining the above and that I was blocked from trading or depositing and received a generic response about withdrawing ACH funds and wait periods???\n\nOn 03/04/21 received \u201cHappy Trading\u201d email from Binance telling me deposits have been enabled, but still my trading/withdraw is disabled \u2013 \u201cTrading disabled due to risk management\u201d\n\nOn 03/05/21 started another ticket (#477430) asking Binance to please take the $500 dollars from the USD sitting in the Binance account. I need to trade my assets! Also, they took 10 days to allow me to deposit money when I was given a 7-day warning of liquidation on 02/23/21. Anyways, plenty of USD sitting in the account.\n\nDuring the past ten days, I\u2019ve done research, and this is happening to many people via Binance. One person stating they had to have a Chinese Lawyer contact the exchange on their behalf. What is going on here? Another saying they felt Binance was stealing their money.  At the end of this post, my coins are down to 16K. Losing money on potential trades on this exchange. What is Binance's definition of stealing? This is nonsensical and a threat to my income. Can we please work together? I want to solve this problem.",

But debit card and Faster Payment (bank transfer) are showing as Suspended. So there's is currently no way to get fiat onto the exchange.\n\nCoincidental maintenance or related to the FCA announcement?\n\n*****EDIT*****\n\nThe intention of this post was not to add to the FUD but a genuine query. I use Faster Payments to deposit fiat (GBP) onto Binance to then trade GBP pairs of crypto I am DCA'ing and HODLing. 0% fees is great and not sure what other exchanges offer equivalent options. A real shame.\n\nThe debit card and Faster Payments deposit methods are still showing as \"suspended\" on the app.\n\nA few people have posted responses from Binance which claim it's general maintenance. May be a coincidence that there is real maintenance, but seems dubious with the FCA noise about the other Binance Markets legal entity.\n\n\n****update 01/07****\n\nFYI - both fiat deposit options are still showing as suspended for me. Got the same email saying they are aware and looking at it, but no date to communicate.\n\nDo any other exchanges offer Faster Payment deposits? This is scuppering my DCA'ing!",

If an exchanges \u00a3/$ profit from a country/region is less than the cost to implement the changes required to comply then it would make financial sense for an exchange to withdraw from that country rather than risk the legal implications.",

I still see it like having a vault/wallet laying around at home against putting your money on a bank.

No Txid has been created yet.\n\nThe support in the chat told me earlier today that it would be resolved in 30-60 minutes, but this was 8 hours ago. I just contacted them again and they told me that the HIVE network would be under maintenance. However, I cannot find anything about this and any other functions in HIVE seems to work.\n\nThe only thing what changed since I first contacted chat support is, that my HIVE withdrawl ability has been suspended. No information text nor estimated time until it is resolved given.\n\nAny help here? Thanks!",

In other words: the widespread adoption of blockchain and decentralization is directly contingent on its interoperability. Blockchain interoperability is currently at the very beginning stages of development and adoption. Blockchain is moving in the interoperability direction, but there is still a long way to go.\n\nMagic Square is an emerging force for blockchain interoperability providing a unified platform and the first marketplace for crypto apps. Magic Square achieves an interoperable user experience with cross-chain bridges, integrated DeFi, and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) technology.\n\nMagic Square has implemented Bridges using deBridge technology in order to allow users the freedom of mobility across blockchains and protocols. Bridges allow:  \n**cross-chain interoperability, compatibility, and composability of smart contracts**  \n**cross-chain swaps**  \n**bridging of arbitrary assets**  \n**interoperability and bridging of NFTs**  \nEssentially, bridges warp coins and tokens to be translated and transferred between blockchains.  \nIt is clear that Magic Square is a driving force for the integration and interoperability of the decentralized space. It would not be surprising if the effects of this platform continue to prove far-reaching.",

I recommend starting out with at least 70-80% Bitcoin in your portfolio, because it will carry you mostly and protect you from dumb trades. If you feel more confident you can reduce it but I wouldn't go lower than 50%. You'll regret it everytime when BTC pump and Altcoins dump. Always remember to put gains into BTC.\n\nNext up is Ethereum (though maybe not right now. GAS fees are super expensive)\nAlternatively you can dab into BNB, which is essentially the same thing but cheaper.\n\nLearn how smart contracts work and try out dApps. They are fun. I recommend Uniswap, AAVE and Cream.\n\nWith Altcoins do your research. Buy what you believe in and not because you see huge gains. Though huge gains can be an indicator that you should research it.",

I got emails from binance to say that my identity and address have been successfully verified. When I check my account, it shows I am verified but when I tried to buy crypto with VISA/MasterCard it said I am limited to buying a maximum of \u20ac250. It tells me to verify my identity to receive a larger limit but when I click to verify it tells me I am already verified! So I purchased coins with my limit of \u20ac250 and now I cannot make anymore purchases. I waited 24hours to see if the limit would reset but it\u2019s been over 24 hours and I still can not buy anything! I contacted binance via chat but no response. I\u2019m a new customer and I\u2019m appalled at binance\u2019s lack of customer service. For a company that big, dealing with financial transactions, it is completely unacceptable to not provide your customers with adequate customer service. Can someone advise me please on what to do or if this has happened to anyone else? Thank you in advance",

The new version does not seem to have this feature, AND they have removed all the useful indicators. This makes active trading impossible from an informed standpoint. \n\nThe new app looks like it should come with a Red Bull and vodka, hair gel, and wreak of Axe body spray. Great. That is cheap, and when investing my money, I'm not looking to be left with a reminder of a lack of money. I look for told you analyze and evaluate and make precise moves. This new app is glitzy trash. This app is drunk.\n\nLike others have already said, it is likely time to end my yearlong association with Binance. \n\nIf I can't get the app to FUNCTION how it did before, I don't care how it looks. There is no reason for me to put money at risk if I can't evaluate the investment, and Binance has put blinders on its users with this update.",

I don't think they will let you let you win anything tbh.\n\nBest case scenario is, if they ask you to send funds to their Binance account then they will have to give you information. If they are smart they won't do this and obviously I won't explain it here. \n\nMaybe just directly ask them. Tell them you are tired of this coin bullshit and you want to send money to them so they can invest it for you. After all they are the experts. Specifically ask for Binance account addresses for whatever coin you are sending. \n\nAlso they might just give you some ''tips, advice'' on what coin to invest in. But I doubt it.\n\nStay safe!",

Their customer support is garbage - you have to wait 10-14 hours to get in touch with someone from the chat support & it often kicks you out when you get in top 20 and you have to start over again. Also 2 days ago Binance crashed, it was absolute bullshit as lots of people lost a lot of money - for a frame of 30-40min, a lot of people were unable to post any orders. Honestly for a platform that made 1 billion in profits for 2020, I believe that they can perform much better, if they reinvest some of it in their customer support & so on..",

Just from a layman\u2019s perspective the project is a platform for developers to jump off of for many different facets of the cryptoverse which include: Esports  (the fastest growing sport in the world) betting (the house always wins), and soon to be nft\u2019s(fastest growing sector in crypto). \nSo I sit back and wonder why your waiting to list something so game changing and exciting, some have even compared it to Shopify in its early stages. It would be wise to list soon in my opinion to see recent volume levels around 15m/day. Just my opinion, take it as you will and have a great day, don\u2019t forget to bepro by the way.",

As soon as I realized a few days later, I contacted (Wells Fargo) and had them remove the order. Since then (over a month ago), I haven't been to move anything on the site. My money has been essentially locked up. I've re-added my bank account info, I've added my debit card, I've sent out a request to the site (to name a few things). I've gotten literally no where with it. I've come here because I've seen that calling them out on public forums seems to get their attention. **PLEASE UPVOTE THIS FOR VISIBILITY!**\n\nThank you so much in advanced people of reddit. I've had great luck relying on you before, hopefully that can be the case here! \n\nMy Support ticket number is #464039",

Decided to try and contact Catherine Coley on Twitter. Never responded. I then left a more aggressive message to her. Few days later....account banned. On top of that, I\u2019m well in the green and can\u2019t touch it. Wonderful!!! I\u2019m reaching out to a lawyer if anyone else is interested.",

Thanks to [symbiotic\\_bnb](https://www.reddit.com/user/symbiotic_bnb/)  \nBinance Online support chat with over 1000 people queuing for 9 hours still remains ridiculous.  \n\n\nYesterday I got an error while trying to place an order : **\"apologies but we are unable to provide services to you as per our terms of service\"** \u2013 couldn't be more f\\*ing clear. So as any sensible human being I go to Binance Support to at least clarify what happened and what I should do next. To say what happened next was frustrating is to say nothing.\n\nI was 905th in the queue in the support chat, and waited for about 9 hours to go through the queue. Or at least I was supposed to. As soon as it was about my turn, the chat reset like nothing happened. ^((Obviously I didn't get to see exactly what happened because nobody would sit next to a support chat 9 hours straight, but i clearly remember that at a 50-something place the numbers go down at a rate of  1 every 5-7 minutes. So when I last checked it was 53, 20 minutes later I check again and it's reset.))\n\nThis was my first day trying to get any human to talk to me about the issue I had.\n\nToday I've pretty much gone through the exact same procedure, although it was about 7 hours instead of 9, but same result. It reset as nothing happened at the very end.A \"lady\" who responded to my ticket strangely resembles a bot. She mentioned a lot of generic things and links to a tutorial to withdraw money from Binance.\n\nAt the moment all of my holdings are in **Binance USD**. And when your account gets banned you're unable to convert your coins but Binance is generously offering you to withdraw them, although no one really cares if you hold BUSD and no exchange apart from Binance accepts BUSD.\n\nSo here I am, been through hours and hours of wait for nothing from the Binance Support chat, getting bot replies on my tickets and a large sum of BUSD on my account locked.\n\nIf anyone can advise me what to do next I would greatly appreciate it. **Because I'm absolutely devastated at this point.** I never thought that one of the biggest crypto exchanges (if not the biggest) would in such clear manner tell the users who desperately need help that they don't give a f\\*ck.",

You'll need to create a Binance .us account but with the exception of TRX, I was able to move everything from binance .com to the .us account without issue.  \n\n\nNote: this was done very recently and likely hasn't changed in terms of access. I had this exact same message, '**apologies but we are unable to provide services to you as per our terms of service'. It won't let you convert unless it's to consoldiate to BNB, but you can withdraw each coin to a new address. For TRX, I had to use my Kraken address because it's not listed (a handful of others aren't on binance .us either)**  \n\n\nGood luck!",

I raised a ticket and have been following up, they finally got in contact and asked for certain information and a video, which I sent and they said it was received correctly. Since then, I haven\u2019t heard back from them. I am quite desperate because a couple of days ago I received an email saying that my account will be closed today if I don\u2019t liquidate my positions and withdraw my crypto, which is funny since I haven\u2019t been able to do so in the last 2 months. I\u2019m still able to log into my account but I\u2019m not able to trade or withdraw.

It's a joke that they use \"protecting you\" as an excuse, when the reason they're doing this is becuase they're terrified that more acceptance of crypto will render banks moot and they won't be able to make a killing off of us with ridiculous fees.\n\nIt's laughable that all the banks are shutting this down and they don't realise that all they're doing is providing EVEN MORE reaosn for everyone to abandon banking institutions.\n\nThis world is a fucking joke. People in power telling us what we can and cannot do. Telling us what we're allowed to spend our money on.  Clearly no body is free, if they don't even have the freedom to spend their hard-earned cash as they see fit.......\n\n\\~Tk",

Binance, many of us believe you may be in a Monero liquidity crisis; and further, we suspect you may have been selling Monero that you don't actually have, which is not only a fractional reserve practice, but amounts to a naked short against the Monero price.\n\nYou have disabled Monero withdraws, citing \"network congestion\" and then \"maintenance\" which was supposed to end Sunday. It is now Thursday, and still no word. Even before the general crypto market crash, many exchanges were at best, sporadically available for Monero purchase/withdraw. We see today that Binance price has significantly diverged from Kraken, who has remained available for XMR withdraws, with just a few delays for less than a day.\n\nWe entertained the possibility this was an issue with the latest Monero minor release. But why not just say that? Why not inform the Monero community, and who can help? You could default back to the previous release with no dangers, while sorting the issues. We concluded it's not that.\n\nSo what is the problem? Please be descriptive and not arcane or terse. Would you be willing to offer some good faith evidence that you do in fact have the Monero that you claim? You could show your the public view key, and a snapshot of the Monero obligated to customers.\n\nPeople deserve an honest response, your customers at a minimum, but in reality, the broader crypto ecosystem",

When selecting one of these trades, is it here that I can actually sell DOGE in exchange for one of the types (now visible through the \u2018trade\u2019 tab)? \n\nWhich type is best? USDT? And then convert that to GBP? \n\n\u2014\n\nDepending on if option 3 is the one to choose here, how do I convert one of those trades back into GBP?

I always make sure I have one kicking about to make my trades cheaper. \n\nHonestly though... if you are new to crypto and enjoy the space I recommend you check out some real projects with interesting things in the pipeline. \n\nFrom experience, you are most likely to get the best returns investing in BTC and ETH and leaving it. \n\nBut that can be boring \ud83d\ude02 \nI am always on the lookout for new projects to follow, Nano and QLC are two which have my attention atm.",

Suspending SEPA withdrawal etc has to do with a crackdown from EU authority on Binance and is not their choice. And I don't really see the problem - why don't you just send the funds to an exchange that provides the withdrawal options you are looking for. E.g. swap the asset you want to withdraw to BNB, send it to SwissBorg or Bitpanda and from there to your bank account. But generally I agree - Binance could for sure do better in many regards. I still use it, because trading fees are low and it offers a lot of awesome features like staking, launchpad, lending etc.",

Many of you have raised concerns that the bot is quite hard to set-up and operate, so there are some pretty cool news that I would like to share.\n\nWith over 1.4k people on our server talking, testing and adding their input on the crypto trading algorithm, and 2.3k stars on GitHub it's clear that this project has massively outgrown its initial bounds.\n\nIf you're not sure what this is all about let me quickly break it down for you before I go on:\n\nThis is a crypto trading engine that analyses all coins on Binance and detects the most volatile ones in order to catch a potential mooning.\n\n* The bot will listen to changes in price across all Coins on Binance paired to USDT\n* The bot checks if the any coin has gone up by more than 3% in the last minute\n* The bot will buy 100 USDT of the most volatile coins on Binance\n* The bot will sell at 2% profit or 2% stop loss\n* There is a sandbox mode to test our different strategies\n* A pause mode, to stop buying once the market goes bearish\n\nThis just a configuration example, and you should experiment with these parameters to figure out what works for you. \n\nI'm excited to say that we are now a team of developers, and not just myself working on this project, and we're working on a more full fledged version of this bot with a proper front-end for config editing, profit loss tracking and more. This is huge as it allows us to add more powerful features onto it.\n\nIf you're interested in the project and would like to be part of the early access, head over here and register your interest: [https://www.cryptomaton.org/binance-crypto-volatility-trading-bot/](https://www.cryptomaton.org/binance-crypto-volatility-trading-bot/)\n\nIf you want to know more about it, or try out the initial version available as open source code, see this link: [https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/06/05/the-future-of-the-binance-volatility-trading-bot/](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/06/05/the-future-of-the-binance-volatility-trading-bot/) It contains some useful links to guides and more resources\n\nLastly, if you're great with coding and just want to play around with the code, no fluff see the GitHub repo: [https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/Binance-volatility-trading-bot](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/Binance-volatility-trading-bot)",

I had a lot of hate for criminals and at a certain moment I had to let it go (it's not worth to ruin your mental and physical health), I mean if you can't change a situation, just accept it and learn from it.\n\nSure learning how to store crypto safely (hardware wallet etc.) and protect yourself from criminals will be a priority.",

While I realize the money is gone, hopefully by creating police reports maybe sometime in the future they can track whoever has done trades. Now I need to try and sleep.\n\nWas just notified of this thread which is exactly what happened:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/p597t5/how\\_i\\_got\\_hacked\\_and\\_lost\\_80k\\_usd\\_in\\_a\\_few\\_hours/](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/p597t5/how_i_got_hacked_and_lost_80k_usd_in_a_few_hours/)\n\nThank you so far, for all your input and help\n\n**EDIT-4**\n\n10 hours and still waiting for an update from Binance.\n\n\\- They have indicated now that they are looking into who would have benefitted from these trades.\n\n**EDIT-5**\n\nI'm not alone with this hack on 3commas\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/3commasCommunity/comments/k1qds3/3commas\\_hack\\_my\\_experience/](https://www.reddit.com/r/3commasCommunity/comments/k1qds3/3commas_hack_my_experience/)\n\n**EDIT-6**\n\nBinance has confirmed that the latest trades made after I deleted the exchange connection in the 3commas account, were commissioned and executed at the same time. This means my keys were leaked or hacked and that they were not done through my account\n\n**EDIT-7**\n\nReply from Binance\n\n>hello sir, we feel terribly sorry to see what you have encountered. upon checking we have located the most beneficial account from the authorized trading and we have locked their account, if you wish to have further investigation, kindly note that it needs the authorities to be involved\n\nOf course, the money has already been withdrawn from Binance but KYC had been done on the account and I will be filing a case against the person and probably also 3commas.\n\nI would like to say thank you to Binance for their efforts, however, some of their support personnel need training in English and basic comprehension. Also, there needs to be a much quicker way to get hold of people at Binance in cases like this where urgency is of utmost importance.\n\n**EDIT-8**  \nSo because the language of some support personnel at Binance is not at the highest level, it seems the information I received was just partially true. Actually, it was not the API key I inserted into 3commas that had been used to drain my funds, but the API keys inserted at trailingcrypto.com. However, the accounts that benefitted from the trades were using 3commas to set everything up. ",

Your API keys may have been compromised through one of the third party sites but the highest probability is that you inadvertently compromised the keys yourself by a virus or other malware on your PC or phone.\n\nYour first step would be to contact law enforcement if that is an option for you.

So much money will keep pouring in, and you know what they said about the gold-rush: \"The people that made the most money are the ones who sold the shovels\" FYI: BINANCE IS SELLING THE SHOVELS, and BNB is the shovel itself. With $10 Billion 24h volume for the last like 3 days, imagine how much Binance will grow, the CEO said he expects it could scale to 50 million users (Coinbase has 55 mil users and it only has 4 coins to buy). \n\nInvesting in BNB is investing in Binance as an exchange and company. \n\nRight now Binance and every other exchange out there is very clogged, deposits and transactions are slow, yes, but scaling at exponential rates is difficult, thats why its good Binance temporarily closed off new registrations. In a few weeks they will be up-to-par with scaling requirements, and when they open the doors there will be probably a million+ new users rushing in and millions more the next 12 months. All of which will find out about BNB, purchase it, use it to cut fees etc... \n\nAlso, Binance is smart, they want to protect their most prized asset, so they are obviously working on things to make BNB have many vital functions in their exchange, and perks etc... Its not just a fee-cutter. \n \nI'm not just speculating price and telling you \"BNB is TO THE MOON LAMBOS 4 EVERY1\"\n\nI am giving you my long-thought out, and proven opinion of Binance's success and BNB's price OUTLOOK from said success. \n\nTLDR: Do what you want, but Binance has become the #1 exchange by far, in just 6 months of being opened. BNB is directly tied to the success of Binance, and we can only imagine what the next 6 months will bring. \n\nDisclosure: (I hold BNB)",

Been using Binance and others since 2017. I on ramp fiat to a domestic exchange, convert it to DOT (usually) then send DOT to whichever exchange I need funds on.\n\nI like getting into projects super early so often times things I want to buy are not listed on Binance so I send funds to whichever exchange offers the market I need. I guess that's made me look at exchanges as just tools and many options to choose from as needed. \n\nBinance is pretty convenient but if it got taken away, it would be easy enough to adapt. \n\nYour other option is to start looking into using DEX's. Since I've started using them, I've moved away from using CEX's like Binance. Just super easy to use a DEX whenever possible for me. \n\nPoint is, there are always going to be other options for us to use if we loose access to Binance.",

We appreciate your patience and understanding.\n\nPlease keep in mind that we cannot provide official support through Reddit.

Reply to the relevant pinned comments with:\n\n* Your support case ID (please double-check your case ID is still valid before posting)\n* Description of your issue\n\n*If your case gets resolved, please delete your comment.

Security issues**\n\n* Report hacked accounts and funds.\n* Difficulty to reset 2FA and gain access to your account.\n\n**5. Trading system and other account issues**\n\n* Spot, margin & futures trading\n* P2P disputes\n* Binance Visa Card transactions\n* Unable to complete KYC\n* Any other issues\n\nPlease follow this format. It helps us classify and identify the issues, escalate them to our relevant departments and get everyone\u2019s problems resolved. *Spamming the feed is unfair to other users and will result in a ban*.\n\nFailure to follow the outlined format will mean moderators are unable to escalate your case.\n\n# All BinanceUS cases should use [r/BinanceUS](https://www.reddit.com/r/BinanceUS/).\n\nThank you!",

There have been cases where a user was hacked, and the hacked account triggered risk control. The hacker contacts support multiple times trying to get the suspension removed but is unsuccessful because of our processes.  \n\n\nKeep in mind that something specific needs to happen to trigger risk control, and these controls help protect users.  \n\n\nWe'll do everything we can to resolve these issues as soon as possible, but please keep in mind that we are trying to keep you, our users, safe.  \n\n\n**Cases replied by our mods are already in the escalation process.

And other questions like what day did you open it... who would possibly know that for something 2-3 years back.\nAt this point, they don't even answer the tickets! they just go unanswered \n\n\nI don't know what to do when I opened the account I invested around 20,000$ I think, now its only worth around 4,000$ but they will not give it back. this has been going on for a year and it feels like they stole the funds from me! \n\n\nthis is my help ticket on Binance: 2406883\n\nif someone from Binance is looking at this, can you please send my funds back to me I just want control on my funds, at this point, I have been submitting tickets for a year!!!! just please give me back my crypto!",

As for IP, if you know the whereabouts/location of the cafe/open area then you state that on your ticket. If you provide as much detail as possible, then it will increase your chances of getting the account back.\n\nThings like, \"ah it was 2-3 years ago man I forgot\" doesn't really help your situation. We take extremely good care of our customer's accounts with the highest level of security, so you'll need to provide as much detail as possible.\n\nHope that helps.",

            "text": "They say you learn through experience. Its ok, I have been scammed terribly. I will explain everything here, if just in case you find yourself doing things in same order, you know what to do.\n\n1) I have randomly checked bscscan on my bsc wallet address and I have seen that I have more tokens than I think I should have had. I participated in sh*tcoin airdrops and what not and I thought ok maybe I got some.\n2) I have seen many alpaca tokens lying around. I have quickly checked the price of alpaca and it's more than a dollar. One red flag here (i) I should have stopped right there, like who would send 200,000 dollars to me right. I didn't. The contract had logo and it's my bad fortune that couldn't be stopped I guess.\n3) I have clicked on the address that sent me these tokens and it looked like a legit contract. It had the logo and it looked like an Airdrop bot contract. And right at the top there is \"alpacafin.com\". I went straight to that website. Red flag here : The website has no content except for the \"claim alpaca\" button\". Yeah I should have stopped right there but do you know why I didn't? I trusted my trust wallet. I mean I have been in this situation before and I had to \"write\" tokens from an Airdrop for them to appear in my wallet. And it was legit.\n4) So , I proceeded connecting my trust wallet and approved the transaction. Red flag here : The approval fees for any token in bsc is ideally very low but this transaction had like 4x the ideal price. \n5) Right after approving the token, I usually see number of transactions = 1 on my trust wallet. This time it was 2.\n6) Poof 3...2...1... All of my DOGE coin gone.\n\nI know giving out your pneumonic phrases was the dumb thing. I didn't knew you could perform 2 transactions on 1 smart contract. Yeah I totally blame myself for my loss.\nJust wanted to share this with new comers like me in this crypto world. God this sh*t is scary.\n\nMy takeaways\n1) Don't use multi coin wallets. Just don't.\n2) Don't believe in random airdops that magically appear in your wallet address.\n3) Be very cautious when connecting your wallet to anything at all. Dyor about the domain.\n\nI've had to learn this the hard way.",

Two days ago I tried to transfer my Vechain to another wallet and Binance blocked me. It said I needed to verify my account again. But when you go to verify it gives you list of all these countries, but not the US. \n\nYesterday when I signed in I got that 48 hour notice to get my funds out or I would be locked out indefinitely. Today I tried to log in again and it was the same thing, it wouldn't even let me click on transfe. With less than 24hrs to go I got desperate. So tried typing in United states again to try and verify, again it wouldn't come up, so I said fuck it and just clicked on the first country that popped up, which was United Emirates. I went ahead and put in my info name, address, city state, what could it hurt? I figured I was about to lose $7500 anyway so I clicked enter, and it went through. Odd. Then it asked me to verify with my camera, so I thought might as well, lets see what happens. Them boom! It fucking worked. It verified me and my ability to withdraw wasn't blocked anymore. I immediately entered my info for my other wallet and unloaded Vet and Vethor. If anyone gets desperate and is running out of time, it's worth a try. Hope this helps.",

When I realized binance could take a week+ to actually give me the crypto, I did not go through with the purchase. I contacted binance support and told them to cancel it. Months later I realized they gave me the crypto even tho i didnt pay (but obviously couldnt withdrawl) Fast forward to now, I'm getting multiple emails. \n\nFirst email says I sold 0.xxxx ETH. Second confirming I just paid back my chargeback amount and they will restore access to my account. Last email just says \"Thank you for your deposit. To confirm its status, please visit your deposit and withdrawal history.\" I'm so confused, because I have no tried to log into my binance for months. \n\nFor reference, eth went up 50% since i initially bought the amount from almost a year ago, so Its saying i still have money in my binance even tho I never paid for shit. What should i do? I dont want this to affect my taxes and stuff. should I tell binance to cancel my account or something?",

I am 17 years old and I put all the money I earned into crypto. I was using a wallet called Exodus Wallet. I accidentally downloaded malware and so my wallet was breached. I was devasted as I had 5 figures in my wallet. I was going to use these funds for college as my family is not wealthy and cannot pay for college. I spent hours tracking the wallets my funds were sent to and contacted exchanges whenever they tried to cash out. The local police will not do anything and exchanges are saying I need the police in order for them to do anything. I have contacted over 7+ exchanges, tweeted at them, and contacted higher-ups at exchanges. No response. I know that in the end, it is my fault and my problem but if anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated. I have a case number with Binance as they said on their website that they have a process for this but cannot find it. No response. I contacted Binance US too and they said they cannot do anything as they are completely different from Binance. I know that in the end, it is my fault and my problem but if anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated.\n\n[https://www.binance.com/en-NG/amp/support/articles/360000006051](https://www.binance.com/en-NG/amp/support/articles/360000006051)",

What do you recommend before invest any money?\n1. Based on what do you buy a specific cryptocurrency instead of another one?\n2. What's the minimum budget recommend to start?\n3. What's the best crypto wallet that you recommend?\n4. Do you recommend trade, stake, mine or hold your crypto and why?\n5. Do you keep all your crypto always on Binance?\n6. What's the best platform you recommend to keep track of your transition (for taxes) and why?\n7. Is there a minimum yearly income that you recommend before reporting taxes? (example, if you get less than \u00a34000 yearly)\n8. Do you need to be registered somewhere to declare your income from crypto? \n\nI'm not sure if I missed something but feel free to add more if you want.\n\nThank you!",

I use Binance & Excels (even though i understand it's a problem now in the UK). it's bit of a mess, but i get around.\n\n\\---\n\ntwo las questions i think regards specific taxation and registration in your country so i'll leave that along with the other questions for other people to answer.\n\nhope this of help !

I'm also planning to complete the tasks to get the welcome bonus of $100. Anything else I'm missing or any suggestions to maximize my sign up bonus? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/akwfr943nwv71.jpg?width=1109&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a7850901b4bd573a96c7b153584b8390c4a229bd\n\nMy understanding is that I just need to deposit more than $50 for the first task so let's say I deposit $60 through an ACH Bank Deposit (I get the $5 fiat or P2P reward) \n\nI can then deposit another $60 of let's say USDC or USDT from another crypto wallet to get the $50 welcome reward. \n\nThen I'll just need to spot trade anything for more than $50 to unlock the $45 reward. \n\nDoes that sound right? Any suggestions?   \nAlso feel free to put your referral links below if it's allowed here. I have signed up yet and I'll use one on those links. \n\nThanks",

Once verified, I deposited $10,000 USD to fund my account and bought some Crypto\n\nA few weeks ago I randomly got a notification on my phone saying \"your sale has been completed\" and it showed that I sold $5000 worth of Zilliqa which was very confusing because I never sold my Zilliqa. I haven't done anything with my Binance account, I barely check it I'm just buying and holding crypto long term\n\nIt showed the $5000 in my USD wallet so just repurchased the same Crypto\n\nAbout a week later the same thing thing happened. This was getting annoying and I didn't want to keep dealing with this issue so I decided to transfer my Crypto to my [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) wallet. Binance wouldn't let me transfer my Crypto so I tried to transfer USD to my bank account, I tried both ACH and wire transfer and it wouldn't let me do that either. Every time I was getting an error message about account security even though my account is fully verified\n\nTonight I got a notification showing that my sale of $5000 of Cardano is complete. I never asked to sell my Cardano. Except this time my Binance USD wallet shows a balance of $0.00 and now my Cardano is gone and $5000 from the sale of the Cardano (which I never I approved of) is missing. This is beyond frustrating\n\nBinance team please figure out what is going on with my account and where my $5000 went \n\nMy original support ticket that I submitted several weeks ago is #1370656 and the new ticket # I just submitted is #1443560",

Putting this 'cause I received some messages wanting to help me after the issue was already resolved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, I am a noob. I am a student starting to get into crypto.\n\nI wanted to try buying crypto on pancakeswap (was super curious to explore what exactly it was and how it worked ). So, I  transferred 10 $ from my spot account on Binance to Binance Smart Chain Wallet (which conveniently did not consume any gas fee). Now that I want to use this crypto in the wallet, I need BNB to spend on gas fees for everything, and the minimum amount that Binance allows to transfer is  0.1 BNB which is worth 66$ last I checked.  66 $ is a considerable amount for me which I can't put in just to get back my 10 $. The total amount I invested in crypto was 70 $, so I can't really put more money to get back that stuck amount at least not in this month.\n\nIs there a workaround for this situation?I am not sure if this is normal (or allowed)  but can anyone send me 0.0015 BNB so that I can transfer the crypto back to my Binance spot account or convert all crypto in my wallet to BNB.

Made some money.  Let me cash some of this in.\n\nWait.  Why the fk is it exchanging my Doge into Euro?  Where's the CAD?!  Okay rookie mistake here.  Gotta do some digging.\n\nAccording to a couple other reddit threads, there's this \"fiat\" thing that exists but it doesn't make fkn sense to me.  I'm dumb.  And I also discover that us lovely Canadians don't get issued IBANs with our banks.  Cool system bro.  So I do some digging.  My money is locked into this fn Binance wallet and SNL is just around the corner.  Fk me if I make a few thousand only to have it locked in some mysterious European crypto wallet.  Some threads talk about Newton, Shakepay and all this jazz.  All I need is another sketchy app on my phone taking my money.\n\nBut wait.  Coinbase has CAD that deposits directly into my bank account.  Coinbase and Binance do the same thing.  My brain work...  Crypto wallets work together.  So I jump onto Coinbase and I look for that transfer wallet ID thing.  Find it.  Dope.  If I exchange my funds on Binance into a Coinbase-enabled cryptocurrency, I bet I send that shit over.  I don't even those Euros.  I just exchange my Doge into BTC and send it to Coinbase.  Deposit into my bank account.\n\nHell yea brother.  Figured it out.  \n\nFurthermore I'm far more comfortable knowing I can transfer the BTC into Coinbase (a publicly traded company) then use some other random-ass app to get it into my bank account.\n\nSo a tip for any Canadians jumping on the Dogecoin.

I tried helping my friend trace it via [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) from his wallet and noticed it flowed to [https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1BBFcrpyVgr5cUhkyREM5GgRK6hLsRV5yv](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1BBFcrpyVgr5cUhkyREM5GgRK6hLsRV5yv) which then flowed ultimately flowed again to [https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1NDyJtNTjmwk5xPNhjgAMu4HDHigtobu1s](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1NDyJtNTjmwk5xPNhjgAMu4HDHigtobu1s) which just so happens to be Binance's [official BTC address](https://twitter.com/binance/status/961666467325358081?s=21)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have done further research and apparently it seems that all the different BTC scams around the world ends up into that address ending **bu1s** for some reason. See ([https://benjaminstrick.com/tracing-an-offshore-bank-and-a-dark-web-service-using-the-blockchain-an-osint-investigation/](https://benjaminstrick.com/tracing-an-offshore-bank-and-a-dark-web-service-using-the-blockchain-an-osint-investigation/)) AND\n\n([https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports/1NDyJtNTjmwk5xPNhjgAMu4HDHigtobu1s](https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports/1NDyJtNTjmwk5xPNhjgAMu4HDHigtobu1s))\n\nCan Binance help to track these Torque team bastards BTC & ETH addresses like in your article [https://academy.binance.com/es/glossary/anti-money-laundering](https://academy.binance.com/es/glossary/anti-money-laundering)? Binance should have all their personal details tied to their BTC & ETH Address to help track the funds and where they live.  \n\n\nHere are the the video to prove they have a Binance account :   \n[https://imgur.com/a/JpRCHdi](https://imgur.com/a/JpRCHdi) (Part 1)  \n[https://imgur.com/a/x9GtdIh](https://imgur.com/a/x9GtdIh) (Part 2)",

Binance can seize and withhold your funds with little or no reason, and they have done so many times. It took me months to get my last assets off their exchange and it nearly took legal action to make them finally release them. My recommendation is to stake off Trust wallet or similar, that way you hold actual possession of your assets in your own wallet. I've been in the crypto game since 2017, and one of the most important thing I learned is to spread my coins and tokens across numerous wallets and platforms to limit exposure to losses through hacks or the aforementioned exchange issues.",

By doing so, you'll greatly increase your chances of success as there's really no room for emotions in investing. Here's another video that should help you out with regards to how much one should invest in crypto: [https://youtu.be/ondgq-Wn4HQ](https://youtu.be/ondgq-Wn4HQ)\n\nLastly, seeing that you're new to crypto in Canada, I've made a beginner's guide that I think you'll get a lot of value from as buying directly from Binance is actually a bit expensive and there are cheaper ways to buy crypto in Canada. www.cryptoforcanadians.ca",

Are they still useful? How? And, finally, which ones? Please share your own thoughts on these questions, and I hope you appreciate [r/noshitcoins](https://www.reddit.com/r/noshitcoins/) take and strategy for maintaining valuable use of LaunchPads, as a research tool.\n\n1. Finding Projects - Here is a standard list of LaunchPads ranked by MC. [https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/launchpad?\\_\\_cf\\_chl\\_managed\\_tk\\_\\_=DJufzNASbnu436hnAXXaNhC5if2lQV0r9wtHU3T5GKs-1639424047-0-gaNycGzNCSU](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/launchpad?__cf_chl_managed_tk__=DJufzNASbnu436hnAXXaNhC5if2lQV0r9wtHU3T5GKs-1639424047-0-gaNycGzNCSU). I've found that checking for upcoming projects on these is a useful means to discovering new projects. I've found that the sweet spot though is a low MC launchPad with a seemingly awesome project are the best to get into pre/post launch, but they're rare finds. More nieche platforms which I like are [https://www.gate.io/startup](https://www.gate.io/startup), [https://coinlist.co/](https://coinlist.co/), [https://app.anypad.io/#/](https://app.anypad.io/#/), [https://launchpad.enjinstarter.com/](https://launchpad.enjinstarter.com/) and [https://lightningprotocol.finance/](https://lightningprotocol.finance/), which have increasingly become one of my favourites to check out for discovering gems. As for small caps, check out [https://www.solchicks.io/partners](https://www.solchicks.io/partners) (the launchpads section) for a pretty healthy entry into this rabbit hole, but I digress, there are literally thousands. And so, what about you guys, which LaunchPads do you like to follow? And what is your favorite? Please share!\n2. Large Cap LaunchPads & Entry Strategy - They generally have the most promising projects of course, such as Polkastarter or Daomaker etc.. although the repeated pattern of massive selloffs following launch can make it tricky knowing when to get into the project. Generally we keep eye on them post-launch throughout the following days/weeks, buying smaller amount here and there around the times we feel they might have bottomed out in order to establish a good average entry price, with a healthy touch of fomo of course, until one day all the selling pressure ceases, or some features launch, then Boom! Post-launch-dump gems usually catch flight unexpectly, that's why we buy small amounts over a short/medium period of time. Following socials/community growth/sentiment is key to analyse & judge the momentum, as well as MC/TVL if your lucky to find it on [https://defillama.com/](https://defillama.com/), as well as user growth, quantifying network effects by tracking unique holder addresses on [https://explorer.bitquery.io/](https://explorer.bitquery.io/) for example, amongst other statistics and sentiment analysis. Understanding token release schedules/distribution is absolutely neccessary to establish an entry point, of course. How about you, how do you enter these positions? Anyone else share our general strategy, or have another startegy/trick to share with the community?\n3. Searching Upcoming ICOs - If you're not using [https://icodrops.com/](https://icodrops.com/) to keep en eye out for new launches, then, you're welcome. This tool is invaluable for finding and keeping a track of upcoming ICOs. They are almost always on large cap LaunchPads requiring whitelists etc.. so keep this in mind. As well, searching ICO, IDO etc.. on twitter usually pulls some interesting find, as well as similar searches on Medium. Often telegram groups are dedicated to finding presales, such as [https://t.me/presalehuntersofficial](https://t.me/presalehuntersofficial) for example, and more, though we tend to use chat oriented resources less often. Of course, other than new tokens we post on [r/noshitcoins](https://www.reddit.com/r/noshitcoins/), does anyone know a subbreddit which is dedicated to listing launches? ..Which isn't overfowing with shitcoins such as cryptomoonshits (which ocassionaly does have credible projects). That would be interesting! How about you, which resources do you use to find upcoming ICO's?\n4. Free LaunchPads - I won't go too much into these as they are infested with shitcoins, as I'm sure you are aware, such as [https://dxsale.app/](https://dxsale.app/), [https://www.pinksale.finance/#/launchpads?chain=BSC](https://www.pinksale.finance/#/launchpads?chain=BSC) (which currently has a token launching literally called 'Shitcoin' LOL, no surprise at all). I liked a small project called [https://www.polydex.fi/ido](https://www.polydex.fi/ido) too for a short while, anyone know any others similar to that? Please share!\n5. Over to the Noshitcoin community - what do you think? I will update this section if we get some good comments below which I've not mentioned! :D\n\nThat about sums this post, thought I'd get some thoughts/opinions from the community on LaunchPads & your strategies for researching & FOMOing in post-launch, as this topic has come up increasingly within my close circle. Luckily I have several friends who hold some large LaunchPad alloactions and are kind enough to alloacate me some fo theirs, if I'm interested, but other than that I don't even try to get into LaunchPads anymore, the allocations are too small, if not a lottery, and their tokens are too volatile. Do you still try to get in to LaunchPads, or use them for some purpose?\n\nAny thoughts guys? Please share with us, it would be great to hear what you think about ours, and learn your methods & strategies when it comes to LaunchPads & ICOs, comment below and check out some other articles!

I've been invested in crypto for roughly 4 years and had always kept my crypto wallet private keys and mneumonics in a password vault on my computer. I never had any issues with that method, so I never saw a reason to change things up.\n\nFast forward to a couple of days ago when I unwittingly downloaded a piece of software to my computer that was infected with a keylogger and other very nasty malware. \n\nI'm now $80k poorer. Once the hackers saw my password vault's master password, my coins were basically presented to them on a silver platter. What a horribly regretful experience. One thing that eases the pain ever so slightly is that I had previously taken profits to recoup my initial investment, so this hasn't completely ruined me financially. But it was such a costly lesson to have learned, and one I'm not sure that I'll ever be able to forgive myself for.",

I want to sell some of these tokens but the available exchanges recommended for these token transactions Binance, Poloniex, and HitBTC are not available in the U.S.  So, I thought the most logical choice would be [Binance.US](http://binance.us/), but much to my surprise the N3 Neon Wallet would not accept the NEO deposit address as a valid NEO N3 address. Then I checked KuCoin and Bittrex exchanges that also had NEO deposit addresses and I got the same error message from the N3 Neon Wallet\u2026 \u201cnot valid NEO N3 address\u201d. \n\nOn my earlier post I was referred to the Binance support team via [https://tawk.to/chat/6215e6df1ffac05b1d7b44a7/default](https://tawk.to/chat/6215e6df1ffac05b1d7b44a7/default) regarding this issue. But unfortunately the advice I received was not relevant to my question. Therefore, I wondered if anyone else has had this issue where they could not fine a crypto exchange servicing U.S. citizens where you could sell NEO N3 tokens. \n\nAny help with this issue is deeply appreciated.",

Before making the transfer from Binance, the page asked me if the wallet to which I was making the transaction was compatible with the Binance Smart Chain network, so I started to investigate if Coinbase (which is the wallet that I started using) was compatible with this network, once verified through the application (attached screenshot) and on a Coinbase page ([https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/getting-started/what-types-of-crypto](https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/getting-started/what-types-of-crypto) \\-does-wallet-support) I decided to carry out the transaction of the tokens, after a few moments and with the nerves that something would go wrong, the transaction is completed. I go to my Coinbase wallet to realize that nothing was found, and in my desperation I looked for any information that would be useful to me to solve this problem and nothing has helped me, I contacted Binance support and they told me that they did not know I couldn't do anything about it because of how the blockchain system worked and that it was irreversible, I also contacted Coinbase support and they told me that they don't work with the BSC network, and that I should have made a minor transfer before sending all the tokens, after that they stopped responding to me and when I opened the link that I had attached, I realized that they had banned my ip from the Coinbase help page (attached screenshot), after that they did not give me any other answer or the situation.\n\nI had no choice but to use a forum like reddit (I've never made a post before) to find out if there is any solution to my problem, it may not be an exorbitant amount of money lost and it was my fault, but We are human and we all have the right to make mistakes. I leave you the data of the transaction and the information that I think may be important. Thank you very much in advance.\n\nPS: I already posted it on a forum and they only spoke to me to scam me so refrain this time. I'm a little disappointed in humanity, it was barely 0.006 eth because I was thinking of buying an NFT :')",

Not nearly enough.**\n\nI have to run statistics on how that compares between let's say UNI and PCS, so please - treat this post more as an aspiring-to-be-technical but more of an community effort post, rather than an actual in-depth analysis.\n\n**This is the single most important thing a retail investor should do before investing in a project:**\n\n1. **Check if she can sell**\n2. **If she can sell, check if in the future this might change.**\n\nSecond step is really where the common man NEEDS devs' help (sneak lvl 999 here)\n\n**When a CEX's primarily goal is to drain an account in less than a few months from 100-0% and incentivize as much frequency of trading as possible to drain fees like mad - really, what else can be the case here, in terms of who runs this scam circus? Who has the means of doing it + no moral ground to have any inhibitions to do that?**\n\nThe DEGREE TO WHICH IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE IS WITHDRAWN IN THE WHOLE CRYPTO COMMUNITY IS FLABBERGASTING - the single most severe issue, leading to scams like Squid Game Token - is almost NOT AT ALL COVERED in the community - nobody talks about it! TRAD FINANCE MEDIA HAS A PROBLEM PINNING IT DOWN - they clone article from article, each one with even less understanding, because it all originates from a journalist boomer, who has zero clue about the scam, and talks out of their asses, multiplying thoughts that are really aggressive financial advice coupled with fearmongering .\n\nSome guy on medium wrote an insanely long article, just because being clearly so triggered by the shitstream media's non-existent understanding of what happened with SGT and still talking out of their asses.\n\nEnd all: **Everybody is entitled to NOT SHARE, but it would really be for the greater good, if the community, as a whole, started a major witchhunt against the honeypot and rugpull scammers.**\n\n*PS: Why am I writing this instead of doing something about it? I'm still learning.* *And seeing this disgrace go on and on and on for endlessly evergrowing in size - whatever I plan to do with my knowledge eventually - a large portion of it I indend to aim at crippling those nets of scammers one way or another.*",

It becomes increasingly more difficult to multiply your investment as the market caps grow. Hence the early bird gets the worm. You cannot be afraid to lose your money on early low cap startups or you can basically forget about hitting those moonshot 100X+ projects in my opinion. \r\nIt helps to know what some of the catalysts are and what to look for to find a project that can potentially go \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1a100\u00d7+. \ud83e\udd13\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb \n\r\nThese are just my opinions from my personal experience and knowledge gained as a non financial advisor. You\u2019re experiences, thoughts, opinions or outlooks may be quite different. \n\r\n*Strong community of holders & bonus if they are willing to schill and help promote by joining all the sites such as Coin market cap, Coin Gecko, Poo Coin, etc. Voting every day and adding to favorites.(Once your an investor in any project you should be willing to do these small steps to help your investment grow.)\n\r\n*Great marketing is always key factor\n\r\n*Something people can get behind and feel good about. (Charity tokens such as $TCUB)\n\n*Utilities- Strong Dapps & partnerships- \u2606EtherLift- Reduce gas fees, \u2606ChainChat-Anonymously coordinate NFT deals, chat about your favorite tokens, and more, securely and privately through direct wallet-to-wallet communication. \u2606TigerTracks-is a graphical representation of the data objects contained within the blockchain.

Seriously if your going to do it.  Don't wait for others to do it first.  That's a second place or also commonly known as the losers way of thinking. Don't listen to these other people's voices telling you to risk this % or that unless again IMO your already wealthy or well to do. I don't care if there a so called financial advisor.  *** Especially if it involves Anything related to crypto currency, blockchain technology, etc..  The game is too new and ever evolving at a breakneck pace that not likely anyone could possibly keep up on everything. Yes there are more knowledge people than others for sure but things are still too new & volatile to blindly follow anyone's advice without some sort of research including my very own. \r\nOnce you have money though then the game is completely different as it's now working in your favor rather than against you. Then I'd personally start following some of the more so called sound advice staking and playing the safe bets for steady gains and avoiding high risk moves. \r\n\r\n***Stunning development--\ud83d\udce2There's no consolation trophy in life for 2nd place only in little league.) But but but I don't want to get  burned\ud83d\udd25. I'm afraid to take that kind of risk or I don't have the money...(Person Drives away in New luxury car or has 3+ TV'S (I sold my awesome TV I love because I figured I can live without it for a few months. In a few weeks from now I can possibly buy it back and a new car maybe even a home to boot..$500 Folks \u00d78,000= 4MILLION$$$$  I'M not telling you this is going to be the case or it will happen overnight.\ud83d\ude06 Do you think I care if I'm off by 50% even 75%? I'm still a potential millionaire from a dang TV I sold.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcb5 \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f   Small sacrifice for chance at big reward. These are the moves that are sometimes the necessary ones many are not willing to make)Then be happy and content being in your current situation the rest of your life if not willing to get burned by what appears to be a fire. Some will do nothing and watch. Some will wait to watch others first then potentially get caught at the height or where gains are minimal and some will just go for it! \r\n Fortune favors the brave and you need to be willing to lose and willing to sacrifice in order to put yourself in a position to capture all of life's glory. I'm pretty sure very few if any goes from poverty to wealthy making safe bets at a slow and steady increase from nothing to a little more maybe around 300% of nothing which is like a huge gain for some people. (Lucky Lottery winners aside) So hooray with your new found wealth of 300% you can now pay that credit card bill and then its all gone just like that... poof.  Now you can take that big gain invested and waited months or years for and pay your credit card down 1%. Then what lol....so some situations require a major sacrifice or catalysts to acquire and move up the wealth chain. \r\nThat's the rich person way and you can do that too but you need to take a chance to get their first. There's an opportunity in front of everyone right now it's called market formation and better yet acceptance and adoption of a new worldwide system of doing just about everything on a new level. It's at this phase happening right now that will only last a blink of an eye when looking back years later that will change the world like planes, trains, automobiles, telephones, computers, internet, Tesla, Microsoft, Google, Amazon. Don't you wish someone wrote an article like this back then and you acted upon it. And maybe some of you did so you already know.  \"And knowing is half the battle\" GI JOE \ud83d\udce2\"YOOOO Joe!!! Had to throw that in there.\ud83d\ude1b \r\n\r\nWith that said I'm just a crazy Crypto Maniac \ud83e\udd16\ud83d\udc7d\ud83e\udd78\ud83e\udd11and certainly no\ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude45 financial advisor as defined by the laws & standards\u2696 set before us.  I just don't sleep \ud83d\udecfand stay up all hours\ud83e\udd74 of the day and night watching videos, charts\ud83d\udcca, my wallets, Penny stocks which BTW mine are very much down at the moment. \ud83d\ude14\ud83e\udd15\ud83d\ude2dBut I'm not a \ud83d\udddePaper hander and see this as a really great buy\ud83d\udcb5 opportunity for them hopefully as I am Diamond \ud83d\udc8e handing\u270a that  s\ud83d\udca9t.

It's a super exciting and interesting concept to watch both these feed off one another. Based on a variety of signals and factors (Lol I don't really have anything such as a program to determine that other than my experience and opinion) I've deeply researched myself I believe these two are both poised to cross the Billion $ Market cap in the coming weeks or months. Look at the charts and you'll see this is getting ready to go bonkers as they lead up to the #1 show on NETFLIX releasing the 2nd season on Nov 17th.  The team has been trying to actually keep the growth from happening to fast as this one can get crazy fast. Marketing is just now getting started in a slow build up. The show and possibly other catalysts like interviews, commercials and so forth make this my #1 pick of picks. It's a constant weekly promotion to 10's of MILLIONS of viewers.(Hello people!! ARE YOU LISTENING NOW?) I'm extremely excited to take this super fast roller coaster ride. \ud83c\udfa2  No fluff from me. There will be likely lots of big swings up and down as profits are taken causing price to come down to where bears will become bulls and then rinse repeat. I've always been called crazy and stupid my whole life.  Maybe in a few weeks or months it will be my turn to look back at everyone and say \"How do you like my crazy stupidity now?\" Yes I'm swinging for the fences with my back against the wall while blind folded.  And personally I'm going against all the experts advice in only risk what you can afford to lose cause for me I'd rather die knowing I took a shot and was willing to give it my all for my dreams than just dreaming about dreams. \r\n Follow your own \u2764\ud83d\udcaf heart, soul and gut instincts at least then your true to yourself even if you don't take a chance and miss this \ud83d\ude80rocket ship to Mars there may be another.  But then again maybe there won't. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Either way hopefully you'll be content with your decision.  ****Please do your own research.  This is just my story and feelings at this time and yours is what you make it out to be. I'm not a financial advisor and also did not sleep at a Holiday Inn Express so this is not financial advice just my thoughts and opinions.****\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on building up my brand new You Tube channel: Zack the Crypto Maniac\n https://youtube.com/channel/UCQAuQNUcUTSqOU5cg56Tm-g\n\r\nLooking forward to adding more content very soon as well as live podcasting and interviews.

            "text": "The traditional gaming industry is worth **$160 billion USD**, with **2.7 billion players globally**!\n\nIn-game spending by players accounted for the biggest share of the video gaming market in 2020. Globally, gamers spent an approximate $54 billion USD on in-game content in addition to initial game purchases. The market value of in-game purchases is projected to surpass $74.4 billion USD by 2025.\n\n**Why is this important for the crypto and NFT world?**\n\nProfits are great for gaming companies and their teams, but how about the user? In-game purchases enhance the user experience and bring extra joy to the game: this is currently the main benefit to users. Additional benefits might include flexing with the latest and hottest gear, and pay to win advantages.\n\nHowever once that money is spent, that value is fully transferred to the game company, and the user no longer retains any value. The in-game assets are centralised and only exist on the company\u2019s database and servers: they are in full control and there\u2019s no way to extract that value back to the user, or transfer it when they are finished with the game.\n\n**Bring in the power of blockchain!**\n\nBlockchain technology is a distributed and decentralised ledger that immutably stores information such as transactions in a way that is verifiable, incorruptible and censorship resistant. Meaning that the historic information in the blockchain cannot be changed by anyone and is there for all to see, transactions can\u2019t be halted by third parties and no permissions are needed to operate, nor do users need permission to transact.\n\nPlayers have had very little control of their in game purchases historically. Traditionally, the gaming company decides whether or not to allow in-game purchases to be traded. Where this is not facilitated by the company, \u2018black market\u2019 stores fill the void \u2014 enabling players to bypass these constraints by buying and selling full accounts. The company receives no benefit from this. Additionally, it can be risky and costly for players to engage in this black market activity.\n\nTrading amongst Fortnite players showcases the constraints of black market trading. Fortnite has a wide range of collectibles, player skins and accessories that users purchase with in-game currency. These cannot be traded or sold to other players. Many speculate the reason for this restriction is to avoid children being taken advantage of through scams in any such trading system. Without a way to easily verify assets from the other party and a sound payment system, this may ring true. Scammers manage to scam over Paypal for example by refunding certain payments after the item they want is sent.\n\nHowever \u2014 whether Fortnite allows it or not \u2014 trading flourishes regardless in the form of buying and selling entire accounts! This only plays into the hands of scammers, pushes trading into a black market environment, and allows vulnerable players such as children to fall prey to scams. Epic Games (owners of Fortnite) need a way to verify their assets, provide payment finality and proof of ownership. This is a perfect use case for blockchain.\n\nBlockchain allows individuals to verifiably hold game assets themselves, in their own personal wallet that a company cannot touch. Known as NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens, they allow unique, non fungible items to be digitally and verifiably owned and traded. These assets can provide a greater sense of ownership towards the game and are interoperable with other games that want to include them. The asset retains its value where there is intrinsic value to that asset: which can be attributed to its utility, access, cultural importance and scarcity. Now players have a way to retain their once sunken in-game costs!\n\n**Blockchain benefits gaming companies too**\n\nGaming companies that can create desirable assets will find their communities feel a greater sense of involvement and attachment to the game and its culture. Players will feel part of a special club and build passion and word of mouth for the assets and the company. These companies can generate royalty sales for secondary sales of the assets, in a verifiable manner, creating a beneficial and less risky trading market. Games can further develop their in-game economies and enhance gamification of their in-game assets. Traditionally, the story lines and lore built around in-game assets serve as entertainment. However, the possibility of user ownership of assets has remained under-rated and is now possible with blockchain and NFTs. The right culture around NFTs can build and inspire invested and loyal communities. The right culture and in-game assets will drive derivatives, spin offs, and other games to accept the assets, adding to the culture, community and value of the company\u2019s assets.\n\n**Player benefits are the driver of this revolution**\n\nWhen game assets are owned by players, game developers are incentivised to cater and collaborate with their community of players, delivering updates the players want and driving a game and economy that puts the players first. Why? When players own the in-game assets as NFTs, and if another game better caters to their needs and wants, they can take their NFTs and play on that game entirely, or participate in both.\n\n*When players hold ownership of NFTs, they feel more invested and dedicated to the game.*\n\nPlayers can participate in other games that integrate their NFTs, enjoying free and open trade. Instead of paying to play, users can play to earn, thus value is given to the company, but also retained by the player: a win/win! Asset trading moves off the \u2018black market\u2019 and is open, transparent and fair. If a player decides to move on they could sell their NFT and retrieve the market value of their NFT, whether that value is retained, increased or dropped, but the option is there and the initial cost is no longer entirely sunk.\n\nBlockchain presents an incredible opportunity for a revolution in access, ownership, inclusivity and economic gain for gamers and game developers. Blockchain adoption will drive innovation, a greater sense of community and quantifiable culture shift that can develop into economies. Truly this frontier is ready for change and brings great benefit to all.",

            "text": "In the past few years I had the unfortunate experience of a crypto winter.\n\n But with Binance on my side and a few other platforms that complemented each-other I've made it through. \n\nAt that time everything was uncertain in the crypto market but I knew what I had to do. \n\nYes, thanks to Binance. Stacking ! Buying shitcoins ! Participating in listings ! Hodling ! Trading ! I've done it all and I've had my share of practice during the crypto winter. Best time to practice in my opinion (lower lows already in, stable prices and volumes even though extremely low). I didn't become a pro but pretty decent in skill and reading candles and patterns(pretty easy to do with Binance once you know some important markers)\n\nBut that is just a small part of my journey with this platform. In between swing trades,high hopes and LIL BUBBLE's debut cover songs, we had a ton of new listings. And THAT, my friends, has changed my crypto experience FOREVER. \n\nFirst of all the FUD/FOMO ratio was real, plenty of people throwing shit coins around and spamming my wallet, names and projects were thrown around, White Papers were flowing everywhere and w.o any doubt it was a hectic market. \n\nBut you see, despite all that, here comes CZ with his flip flops and cool relaxed attitude to tell everyone that those listings and shitcoins we then had, will some day be worth so much more. \n\nDid I really believe that ? \n\nNo I didn't but I wish I did so I could invest more.  \n\nAnyway, everything I've got during listings were forgotten there on the exchange getting dusty. Or so I though... \n\nYET, We all know the outcome to that and I must mention some of these coins I've got into at that time were ERD, OGN , CELER, and BTT. (if only I could've foresee better and listen more to CZ's tweets...) \n\nOn a brighter note though, ever since those times, not only that these coins grew in volumes, price and community but have been partnered and paired with BNB(day 1) , BUSD , USDT and some even with DAI. \n\nThese pairings  made it possible for us to trade more wild and have a potential for more profits buy low , sell high and repeat. Exciting times when everything seemed so simple.\n\nAfter a few years of Binance pairings are still happening and my shitcoins have grown into real gems. \n\nBinance is still trying to make things simple and I appreciate that. \n\nOne of my favorite coins OGN, was paired with BUSD today , here is the original announcement that made my heart melt [https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/cc85f83ab7d2459ab20d67dcb88ce9ce](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/cc85f83ab7d2459ab20d67dcb88ce9ce)\n\nSo, yes I am very grateful ! And wanted to say THANK YOU BINANCE and ty for the community that made this possible. All the pairings have been extremely useful and please keep up with listing new coins !\n\n Not for a quick cash grab but for a crypto future and for giving people a chance to financial freedom and true decentralization.  If you've been reading this far into my rant, TY and may the bulls open the path for you ! Peace !",

            "text": " \n\n# Introduction\n\nIn the past, there was almost no cost involved in creating an item in the digital world. As a result, these items have become worthless because they are not difficult to create or reproduce/duplicate.\n\nWith the advent of blockchain, scarcity in the digital world was created and it connected a part of the real world to the virtual world.\n\nNFT is one of the key foundations of the new digital economy, powered by blockchain. NFT has been tested in areas such as gaming, digital identity, licensing, certification and fine arts. Users can even split and proportionally own items of high value.\n\nToday, we dive into what NFTs are, what are they used for, and how a game called CryptoKitties clogged the Ethereum blockchain in late 2017.\n\n# What is Non-Fungible Token (NFT)?\n\nNon-fungible Token (NFT) is a type of cryptographic on the blockchain that represents a single asset. This could be a virtual asset or an encrypted version of an asset in the real world. Since NFTs are NOT interchangeable, they can act as proof of authenticity and ownership in the digital realm.\n\n>Therefore, NFT has 2 properties: UNIQUE and LIMITED.\n\nThe following example will help you better understand the NFT: A $10 bill you can be exchanged for another $10 bill from someone else, assuming that it is genuine. This is a fundamental property of assets that serve as a medium of exchange. In theory, there is no way of recognising their differences (other than the money series number). However, exchangeability is not a trait in favour of collectable items.\n\nWhat if we could create digital assets similar to Bitcoin, but add a unique identifier to each asset unit?\n\nThis will make each of them different from all the others (i.e., irreplaceable). Basically, this is what NFT is.\n\n# How does NFT work?\n\nFirst of all, we need to understand that NFT is essential items that can be collected. Like a painting, rather than a typical token which has lots of incentives associated with it to increase buyer demand.\n\nTherefore, valuing NFT is like valuing a real-life precious item; whoever feels it has a price, will pay that price.\n\nExample: There are a lot of abstract paintings that are worth a few thousand dollars. Very few people understand what they mean, for example, but people still buy them.\n\nSpeaking of issuance standards, usually on the Ethereum blockchain, tokens are popular in ERC-20. But in the NFT, a lot of standards are adopted, the most prominent of which is ERC-721. A recently improved standard is ERC-1155, which allows single contracts to contain fungible and non-fungible tokens, opening up a whole new range of possibilities.\n\nLike other tokens, NFT can be stored in a personal wallet, typically a Trust Wallet. It should be noted that NFT cannot be copied or transformed without the owner's permission - even by the NFT publisher.\n\n# What is NFT used for?\n\nNFT can be used by decentralised applications (DApps) to issue digital items and cryptocurrency collections. These tokens could be a collectable item, an investment product, or something else.\n\nOr specifically in the field of gaming - plowing the top racing game and picking up good items is something we have all done at some point. There are many online games that have their own economy in games, so using NFT can solve or mitigate the common inflation problem many games face.\n\nWhat about the real world?\n\nNFT can represent small chunks of real-world assets that can be stored and traded as tokens on the blockchain. This can provide the necessary liquidity for many markets that would otherwise not have a lot of participants. Such as handicrafts, real estate, rare collectables, rare whisky, rare wines.\n\nDigital identity is also an area where NFT's attributes can be beneficial. Storing identity and ownership data on the blockchain will increase data privacy and integrity for many people around the world.\n\n \n\n**TLDR**:\n\nIn the past, NFT was valuable simply because people liked it, wanted to collect it, or found it interesting. These days, NFT has turned to DeFi to take the token to a new level. These innovations contribute to creating value for them. Despite the controversy surrounding the NFTs, they are still going strong.",

As read posts here and often see like 2-3 steps where people told best way to convert. So I don't get it does the cost on crypto get lower bigger the amounts to convert it, and how the fuck do ppl manage to turn profit on small amounts shit coins when on many u end up paying more in conversions/swaps, as u can have 100usd whatever make few conversions and you can be down 40% on them costs before u even Started to trade anything",

Research till you find 3 or 4 coins you 'believe' in and HODL them. When things are pumping take some profit, if not, buy more over time. Accumulate and remember average dollar cost! If you don't have that kind of patience, you should look into shorting/longing instead.  Consider when to buy.. a massive upswing might turn into a loss next day. Buying when market is down turns profit later on. Don't keep huge amounts on exchange, Research outside YouTube, don't send your coins to no BS giveaway scam!",

            "text": "I know that many new traders and investors find it difficult to choose the best exchange. Binance and Coinbase are both platforms for buying, transferring, storing, and selling your digital currency securely. Binance and Coinbase can allow you to exchange currency for another digital currency, an asset, or even fiat money (a currency established as money. i.e., USDT, BUSD, DAI, RUB, EUR) even without a broker. We'll see if Binance is better than Coinbase or vice versa to assist you in picking which financial system is right for you.\n\n# Binance: Pros and Cons\n\nBinance is well known for low trading fees. If you trade with BNB, you get a 25% discount on the normal fee. It is the biggest crypto exchange in the world.\n\n**Pros:**\n\nBinance, unlike Coinbase and several other platforms, allows a wide range of fiat currencies. It supports currency exchanges from USD to EUR and over 50 other currencies, making it a popular choice for anyone looking to trade in that capacity. Binance has swept aside numerous smaller platforms that can't compete with its huge selection of cryptocurrencies and altcoins since its start. Binance ranked among the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world in 2021, with a trading volume of 18.63B USD.\n\n* Binance lite mobile app has a straightforward interface that can make it easier for beginners. If you want more information and advanced staff, you can switch to advance mode in the mobile app and use their website.\n* The maximum trading amount is unlimited, while others are capped.\n* Huge coin collection.\n* Low trading fees at 0.1% and less. (25% discount if you trade with BNB).\n* Easy sign-up process.\n* Excellent customer service\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Binance does not have a built-in wallet feature.\n* Many features are not available in few states of the USA. But it's available in many countries.\n* Non-transparent corporate structure.\n\nOverall, Binance is a powerful platform with many great features that are just becoming stronger with each passing day. Binance is the platform to utilize if you want minimal trading costs and access to lesser-known cryptocurrencies that other platforms may not provide.\n\n Register on Binance: [accounts.binance.com/en/register](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=AJO2E7X8) \n\n# Coinbase: Pros and Cons\n\nCoinbase is well known as an American exchange. Coinbase was one of the first exchange apps that employ a broker-style user interface to convert USD from your bank account directly into bitcoin.**Pros:**\n\n* All major coins are available.\n* Easy to trade in the US.\n* High security.\n* Clean interface, which is good for beginners.\n* The customer support is known to be good quality\n\nCoinbase has a large user base, estimated to be over 13 million. While there is plenty to like about the platform, there are also drawbacks, such as a limited number of coins and greater trading costs than other platforms.Here are a few of the **cons:**\n\n* Not available in all countries\n* Lesser-known currencies aren't supported.\n* A lower number of cryptocurrencies accepted than other platforms\n* Higher fees\n* If you wish to trade in fiat currency and withdraw to your bank, Coinbase is perfect. If you are based in the United States, it is also a better platform.\n\n# Conclusion( My Opinion):If you are a US citizen, it's better to start with Coinbase. But I recommend Binance for the non-US residents. I am a non-US resident. I started my trading career on Binance. Till now I haven't face any problems. Binance is more advance, and it has so many exciting features to explore. You can use its P2P platform to deposit initial funds or use Visa/MasterCard to buy coins.",

Furthermore, I was, and still am, quite a bit of a newbie when it comes to this stuff.   \n\nNow that I have a bit more time on my hands I figured I should try and get all this stuff sorted out, as a have a decent little amount of holdings in Binance.  I realize I shouldn\u2019t have left these holdings on an exchange, but again I\u2019m a newb.  I never received an email from Binance telling me about the US cutoff and have not tried to log in in quite a while as I haven\u2019t been actively trading.  I know I should have at least checked in to see what was going on, but really had no clue that I would have issues getting into my Binance account.  \n\nI tried to reach out to customer support with no luck.  I\u2019m trying to access my account to transfer to Binance.us, Coinbase, and/or external wallets.  I just want to get these holdings transferred out, but am unable to do so.  Not gonna lie, but I\u2019m a tad bit worried that these funds are lost.  Any insight or suggestions into how I can successfully obtain and transfer these holdings out of Binance.com and over to other wallets would be greatly appreciated!  Hoping I\u2019m not SOL\u2026\n\nThanks all,\n\nJD",

I've been beyond impressed with CZ and the team pretty much from day 1, and am really hoping that he can come through with the opening of the binance.US exchange in time before the .com is illegal. BAM Trading Services got approval from FinCEN on June 11, so I am fairly confident that the US exchange will be live before the Sept deadline. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGetting the .US exchange up before the deadline is only step #1. Around 30% of [binance.com](https://binance.com) users are from the US, and I would guess many would gladly move to the .US exchange as long as it is open with enough time (2-3 weeks) ahead of deadline. The next question is will BNB immediately be available on the .US exchange / will it be deemed NOT a security? I believe that BNB is NOT a security. CZ has been proactive in making moves to lessen the gray area regarding this topic, with most recently announcing 100% of the teams allocated coins will be used for future coin burns. Here's another reason why I like BNBs odds: ZRX is not considered a security, and it essentially serves the same primary utility as BNB. Anyone creating an exchange using the ZRX protocol is required to charge their trading commissions in ZRX, similarly to how BNB is used for trading fees on binance. I've searched the web up and down and am just patiently waiting for the .US exchange to be announced as well as BNB being one of the coins available from day 1. Unlike many comments I've read, I am not worried that funds left on [binance.com](https://binance.com) will be frozen/unaccessible after Sept. No deposits or trading allowed, but withdrawing will still be possible. I am assuming some cautious traders/investors have already sold their BNB, and I've taken this recent dip as an opportunity to scoop up more coins. Yes, I have moved my long term BNB to a hard wallet, but even if BNB isnt available from the get go - Binance is a global platform with growing utility for BNB everyday. CZ is the #1 leader in the entire crypto space and he will not give up on the US. He is very well aware how important the US market is. Follow me on IG @buylowstayhigh for more in depth posts!",

Trading crypto since 2013, I know, that if you ever are in urgend need of a support from ANY exchange, you are either fucked or you will wait weeks to get some standard answer.  \nI just started using Binance yesterday, as I got screwed over by already too many exchanges (lost big at MtGox & Bitcoin24), I was not too keen on trying out new exchanges. But I needed a coin, I only could get there or on Etherdelta (fuck that, biggest nightmare ever!). First transaction (BTC) went fine, so today I sent some ETH form Bitstamp (yes, now I know that you need to send them from Bitstamp to my wallet first and than to Binance, cause how Bitstamp handles ETH transactions) and they were not credited to my wallet on Binance. On etherscan they appeared only as an internal transaction, Binance cant handle them. OK, another 5ETH lost to the exchanges limbo I thought.  \nI opened a ticket and minutes (!) later they answered my question & that they will fix it asap. A little later the ETH appeared in my account!  \nAt bittrex I would have waited a few weeks to get a standard c&p answer (probably to tell me, my coins are lost), polo probably would just ignored me, others as well. Why do all the other exchanges just dont give a fuck and dont hire enough people for customer support (they make more than a lot with their fees), why is everyone fine with that?!!\nFor the future, I will only trade on exchanges that actually have & give you support and were customers are taken seriously. So sick of that shit.  \n&nbsp;  \n\nMy WORST customer support this year:  \nPolo: usually no response, or maybe I need to wait a few more weeks?  \nBittrex: still got one ticket from beginning of July, only answered 4weeks later by their bot yet: to open a new ticket if the   problem still remains!! still waiting for an answer  \nHitBTC: answers c&p texts, does not go into the problem raised in the ticket   \n&nbsp;    \n\nBest so far:  \nBinance: instant!  \nBitstamp usually within a day  \nliqui: though it seems shady as an exchange & have way too high fees, at least I got all tickets resolved within 1-2days\n",

I mean they are the best exchange by far, as far as user interface, no site crashes at all, easy buying and selling. They convert your BTC amount to USD in your wallet which is a life saver. I did use Binance at first but honestly I think they will get hit with so much oversight, regulations and taxes it wound be worth it for them. They got in at the wrong time. They should've waited and based thereselves out of Singapore or Thailand which are very crypto friendly.",

I've used it to trade leveraged derivatives, to stake ETH, to yield farm, to collect flexible and fixed savings and I've enjoyed the minuscule fees thanks to the BSC and aggregate transfers. Moving away from Binance was the hardest thing I've done in crypto. \n\nAt first I figured Reddit was the obvious place to go for account issues, so I didn't think much of the fact that a lot of people went here with problems, and figured they weren't representative for a majority of Binance users.\n\nWhen I realized every single new thread was people complaining about shady business dealings and a non-existent support center, I got a little more wary. But then, I thought, surely a billion-dollar company wouldn't care to steal or block access to a few thousand dollars in my account, since the fines alone would be higher. So I didn't worry. \n\nI even figured many of the threads might be competing exchanges paying to have people shit on Binance on Reddit, but then you'd expect at least **some** legitimate users pushing back, right? \n\nSo I'm sitting here staring at  company that, from the outside looking in, looks almost about to implode, like some big ponzi scheme. My savings are in crypto. My girlfriends and my house savings are in crypto too. I can't risk it. \n\nSo today I moved all of my Binance assets to Trust Wallet until I can afford a Ledger, and then I will move to that. It sucks because I don't care as much about the privacy as I do the ease-of-access to the exchanges and Binance had everything I could ask for including derivatives and savings. That's all gone now, and I refuse to pay the insane gas fees to do those things on the ETH blockchain. \n\nSo it sucks. I might put $100 back into Binance just to trade with because I honestly miss that functionality so much already, and if I lose that to some shady business, that's the price I pay, but the majority of my crypto will be kept off the exchange until they get their shit and their support team together. Same goes for BEP20 tokens, not touching them with a ten foot pole until Binance has its ducks in a row again. \n\nPlease, Binance. You're hands down **the** best exchange in terms of features, coins and options. Get your shit and your support team together please, and get regulated somewhere other than fucking Malta, so I can support you in good conscience again and sleep well with my money on your exchange.",

I often work from coffee shops, so I routinely use a VPN for security. If that flagged me as a criminal, that's lame.\n\nAnyway, I logged in from home, no VPN, and completed the video KYC. Got the confirmation email saying I was approved to withdraw 100 BTC. Then I attempted to withdraw much less (the crypto equivalent of about 1000 USD), again in the same session, no VPN. Binance blocked me again, for \"risk control\".\n\nWhy does Binance even bother with these bullshit KYC hoops, and \"approve\" customers to withdraw ridiculous amounts (who has 100 BTC?), then block them for only $1K? Is the answer [something vague again](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/c0usca/can_i_withdraw_12_btc_without_being_forced_to_kyc/er93rzm/)?\n\nBut okay, whatever, I lost my job and need to pay rent so I'm willing to go through more KYC. **If I can get a time machine, that is (see the last requirement)**. Here's the new KYC requirements, broken English copy/pasted verbatim from the Binance email:\n\n> Dear user,\n>\n> Thanks for your inquiry.\n>\n> As per checked, we found that the withdraw function was suspended due to the withdrawal risk control. We are going to help you through the ticket.\n> \n> Please provide us with the following information for the account verification:\n> \n> Security questions:\n>\n> 1. Account registration date\n> 2. Account registration IP\n> 3. Device information (at minimum operating system version, brand, model, and browser name/version) regarding at least one device that is commonly used on the account.)\n>\n> Video verification:\n>\n> 1. In the video, please provide your withdrawal records and communication records with Binance CS. You also need to appear in the video and hold the information page of your ID document, and clearly say: \"Today is the year/month/day, my account is applying for withdrawal of XXX coins with XXX amount. I confirm that it is my own operation. I am contacting Binance CS to resume the withdrawal function of my Binance account xxx@xxx.com \"\n>\n> 2. **A video of the first deposit you made to your Binance account. The video should contain the whole login process from the sender platform/wallet**, and information for this transaction such as the full TxID, date and amount.\n\nIs this a language barrier issue? How am I supposed to record a video of the first deposit I made to Binance years ago?!\n\nYou guys run a multi-billion dollar exchange and can't hire a professional English speaker?\n\nOr do you just want to make KYC impossible?",

So do I just gain on that by leaving it in my Binanace wallet? If so how often do I gain, and how much?\n\nWith Fixed/Flexible savings, are there risks of losing my tokens by comitting to them? If say on ADA it says 60 days (locked), est APY 7.79%, then is it simply I put my ADA in, it means I can't access/trade it for 60 days, but then at the end I get that back plus around 7%? It just seems too good to be true, you surely don't get something for nothing, so where is the risk? Is there potential I'll lose my tokens or get back less than what I put in? (ignoring extreme cases like Binance being hacked or suddenly vanishing)\n\nAnd with Launchpool, is that similar to fixed term savings, except you get a different token back at the end of it? Today I have just put in 0.41 BNB into the ALICE Launchpool, which says 30 days farming (27 till it ends), so I take it my BNB is tied up there for 30/27days, then after that I get my BNB back plus hopefully some ALICE too? Again is there risk losing tokens this way?\n\nI'm not worried about the downside of my tokens being tied up in savings or Launchpool, as I plan to hold them all long term anyway, but I'm just more curious how to work out where the risks are in each of the staking, saving, and launchpool options, as well to work out what I get back at the end of the fixed periods. \n\nThanks in advance.",

In your example, you want do stake ADA for 60 days for 7.79% APY. You don\u2018t get 7.79% after these 60 days. The 7.79% are always per year. Your have to break it down to the 60 days: 60/365 of 7.79% are 1.28%. After 60 days you get 1.28%, but you WOULD get 7.79 if you continued to stake for the whole year.",

Moderate earnings, if you take it out before term is due, you get zero interest.\n\nFlexible savings: miserable yield but zero commitment. Interest is paid daily, take it out anytime you want and keep earnings yielded.\n\nLaunchpool: you provide funds to a new crypto/project, and earn rewards in their token based on your commitment. Stake for a fixed amount of time to earn rewards that could potentially moon.\n\nIn none of those are your assets in any risk, other than the obvious one of the coin losing its value. You will get at least, your investment back.",

And, there is nothing in the [Binance.US](https://binance.us/) interface that tells you that your account is restricted. You find out when you try to withdraw, trade, convert or move crypto between their wallet and another wallet. It is totally insane and I am surprised that US regulators have not gotten involved yet. I encourage anyone having these issues to report to BBB as well as state and attorney general consumer affairs offices. Fairly easy to get an account set up and start buying crypto, but if I had to do it all over, I would have stayed away from Binance.US.",

I've had two issues with my account (one that was my fault and the other on them) and the support team was legit. The first problem was me locking myself out of BNB after breaking my phone with 2FA on it, and no way to access my backup code (I was an idiot), they handled it in MINUTES, not even an hour passed. The second time was when I set up an account for my father (YAY! ONLY TOOK 4 YEARS) and for whatever reason his default ETH address started with \"09\" instead of \"0x\"- something I had never seen before in my years of crypto. I submitted a support ticket and it was taken care of immediately. Again only minutes had passed before my problem had been resolved.\n\nThe most recent update to the \"advanced\" exchange has become my favorite user interface. As a daytrader the ability to have interactive graphs/ depth chart, the order book, and your open orders/ trade history on one page is amazing. \n\nI am happy to continue setting up new crypto-investors on binance, a big reason is because of the deposit/withdrawal screen. I've noticed incoming deposits and outgoing withdrawals are a lot more active and measurable on the binance platform. Thinking back on my first couple transactions, I was pretty nervous as well. That sort of feature is nice for newbies, hell it gives me a little peace of mind with big transfers.\n\nSuper happy I got on this exchange, shout out to you Binance team",

Its a red day for mostly everyone but we cant loose hope of the companies and tokens that are actually pushing the game.\n\nIve been in LTO for almost a year now (as an investor) and its amazing what a company that is working so hard can do. Onboarding clients like :UN, Kate Innovations,NEN, acquiring VIDT and trying to bring the best tokenomics for everyone involved (7% interest apy via mainnet wallet via POS) is a hard task but its something LTO has demostrated me its possible.\n\nBridging the gap between the business world and the crypto world is one of the biggest challenges right now, most projects are trying this but LTO is succeeding at making it happen.\n\nReal clients(UN,NEN,Kate and more), real paid txs(over 100ktx daily), great apy(around 7% apy), great team and now getting listed in a new exchange in the near future(hinted in last AMA)\n\nThe UN case can always be taken out of context cause there are other projects \"partnering\" with the UN but the reality is that LTO built a solution and delivered it. The idea of this specific project is to get the Land Registry of third world countries into the blockchain (LTOs blockchain)being Afghanistan the first one (already in process). I would argue that the actual performance of this implementation is not what makes this use case bullish but what really makes it bullish is that these has opened the doors for lots of new clients to actually use the blockchain (unlike other projects that only promise)\n\nNow the real challenges LTO has right now is getting more noticed in crypto and that is not concerning at all. See when a company is self sustainable like LTO, growth in the space is innevitable, these prices right now are bargains and I wouldnt even look at other tokens when I have a gem like this in front.\n\nNow with LTOs contacts in governments they are bringing in DIDs and Verifiable Credentials, this means that through out this year LTO will start being implemented as a backend in KYC in DEFI. Yeah thats right, youll be using LTO and you wont know it when you are getting your credentials verified, this will lead to a push for a lot more adoption.\n\nSo if you are looking at VET read more on LTO. If you are looking at TRAC read more on LTO.\n\nIts right in front of you and ill keep DCAing cause the day LTO rises like LINK did I want to be there, not only to make money but to congratulate the team on all the hard work and look back on the days there where fudders and doubters who only saw \"price\" performance in that moment or where they where in the \"top\".\n\nMy suggestion (not financial advice at all) get atleast 10k LTO and lease it to a node and forget a out it, youll be surprised what LTO is about to bring into the space.",

            "text": "I feel this post probably won't get taken down and that binance lowkey wants everyone to do this. but here's what you do if you're tired of dealing with Binance US's BS.\n\nStep 1: Get a VPN. I highly recommmend Avast Secureline. NordVPN is kind of squirrely, but it'll also do in a pinch; plus you can use it on virtually any device. From there, you'll want to set your location as somewhere like Turkey, Ukraine, or The Netherlands.\n\nStep 2: With your VPN active. Set up a non-US Binance. In general, the non-US is better. You have a lot more currencies to choose from and additional cool things like crypto-savings that earn interest and a crypto-equivelent to CD's that earn hella interest. Interest is good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome issues: Don't link your bank or card to this. That will make it obvious you're from the US. Fortunately, you have deposit and withdrawal addresses so that you can send crypto from another account directly to your binance account. I would recommend using coinbase and sending EOS as there's only like a $3.99 purchasing fee and 0 transaction fees with EOS. From there, you can exchange that crypto for other crypto, which is what binance was originally designed for. Also, make sure you always have your VPN running when you log in. Else you'll get that \"We think you may be from the US message. That would be bad\". It also creates a layer of anonymity as countries like Turkey and the Netherlands don't do KYC = this isn't getting reported to the IRS.\n\nIf you're feeling gracious, use rfrl nmbr 62739631 to show your gratitude and help ya boy out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I'm generally curious to see how long this stays up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: A word\n\nEdit 2: I saw a comment show up in my feed that looks like it then disappeared. So I'll try and answer it to the best of my memory. Doing fiat deposits/withdrawals on non-US requires some sort of ID. But crypto deposits/withdrawals generally do not. If you go to your wallet, select the coin you want to transfer in, and click the deposit button, you'll get a nice little QR code that's tied to a deposit address. This allows you to circumvent fiat deposits/withdrawals altogether and shouldn't require KYC to do.",

As such, Binance made a timely decision to suspend trading, withdrawals and other account functions.\n\nWe have since taken the following actions relating to this incident:\n\n* To protect the safety of our API users, we have removed all existing API keys and requested all API users to recreate their API keys. We implore our users to take care of their API keys going forward:  \n**1)** If you are not a regular API user, please do not create an API key.  \n**2)** Do not give any third-party service providers access to your personal API key.  \n**3)** Use the IP whitelist functionality to ensure your key is only accessible to you.\n* Rollback of irregular trades.\n* For the users who were negatively affected by choosing to trade the rising SYS price, Binance will offer zero-fee trading between 2018/07/05\u20132018/07/14. If you traded SYS during the incident and believe you were negatively affected, please [open a support ticket](https://support.binance.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000024931).\n* For all other Binance users, we will offer a 70&#37; rebate on the trading fees paid by you between 2018/07/05\u20132018/07/14. The rebate will be given in the form of BNB calculated using the closing price on 2018/07/14.\n* To protect the future interests of all users, Binance will create a **Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU)**. Starting from 2018/07/14, we will allocate 10&#37; of all trading fees received into SAFU to offer protection to our users and their funds in extreme cases. This fund will be stored in a separate cold wallet.\n\nSince founding, Binance has always upheld our core values of spreading crypto and protecting users. Binance has achieved explosive growth in the first year. With this growth, we also experience many problems. We must reflect upon these problems, learn from them, and improve ourselves. We know in the course of making history, we will be tested again and again. We believe every test makes us stronger. And only if we fight together, can we move the industry forward. We thank all of our supporters, those who nudged us forward. We welcome your comments, suggestions and feedback. Thank you for being with us on our journey.

Now, I expect some of my currencies will see major growth in the coming year and I want to be able to execute a quick deposit to my bank when I think my coins have hit their peak. \n\nIn order to sell my coins on binance I first have to convert to ETH or BTC and send to my coinbase wallet. From there I can sell to fiat in using PayPal (up to $3000 per transaction, which is low and I'll have to execute multiple transactions just to liquidate all of my crypto). I've withdrew some small \"tester\" sums to analyze this process, and it works. The issue is that the process takes a long time and there can be catastrophic market fluctuations while I am waiting for transactions to clear.\n\nSo I guess my question to experienced investors in Canada is:\n\nIf bitcoin rallies 400%(for example) and you want to cash out before it crashes, what is your process for getting the funds as quickly as possible to avoid losses?\n\nPs. I am using the terminologies here to the best of my knowledge but let me know if the syntax is inadequate for this query.\n\nThanks again!",

If $7.5M profit in the very first quarter is bad to some people, then I recommend those people to TRY to find other coins.  haha\n\n> Your understanding of buy-back is from the stock market.  You can't expect everything to work the same way in crypto.  Or you might as well just keep trading stocks.  You don't pay in stocks for commissions fees, for one.\n\n> Some of you guys need to stop this second-guessing and conspiracy theory stuff, or we may start to \"invite you out of the group\", as it is just generating unnecessary fud, and I have to spend time to respond.\n\n> We fulfilled all our promises from our white-paper, no delays, no adjustments, no excuses\n\n> We obviously collect most of our trading commissions in BNB and most of our other revenue are also only payable in BNB.  We could sell them as we collect them, then do \"one-big-buy-wall\" on the market, or we could keep them do one big sell order and then buy it back with one big buy order.  Or we could just keep all the BNBs we collect, do one withdraw to a wallet and burn it there.  We could do any combination of the above.\n\n> The important thing is, the team portion has never moved.  They still sits on the contract creators address.  That's our reserve.  We did not burn that.  The BNB we burned are additional BNB we earned/bought/sold and then bought or however you like to call it.  It's pretty simple.\n\n> Regarding the transaction history, we simply process this withdraw from a different cold wallet as the number is rather large.  It's a wallet we don't use that often.\n\n> As most of our revenue is in BNB, when we have to spend fiat money, to buy some take outs for example, we could sell BTC or ETH we raised during our ICO, or BNB to BTC to fiat, or BNB to fiat directly on the OTC market, or any combination of the above.  We don't disclose this part.  It's our private affairs.",

I've read about this \"Safemoon\" and had conflicting information so far. It's a scam, it's not a scam it's legit etc etc.\n\nI'd be willing to put a small investment into it - enough that even IF I lose it, it won't matter - but I don't know alot about all the different wallets / apps / coins / tokens etc etc etc and I'm a little scared of fucking it up and ending up getting banking details scraped or something. ( I don't even know if thats possible)\n\nBinance is the only App I have for this sort of thing as it was recommended by a friend that uses it. Is there a time / date that safemoon might make it onto Binance?\n\nIs there a way to buy into it from Binance already? Or is my only option to get this \"Trust Wallet\" and buy BNB and convert it to Safemoon?\n\nI'm looking into stuff for markets, technical anlysis and such, but theres so much crypto out there and information, that I'm not sure what I need to know about certain coins to know if they're reliable / same for the various Applications and such. Find it difficult to find the right kind of information.\n\n\\~Tk",

My advice is do your own research and dont invest more than you can afford to lose. The point of crypto trading is buying at a low price and getting someone to buy from you at a premium thus the profit. However if everyone sells it would be worthless, the only way to win is never selling which is indeed unsustainable. My advice is dont be a diamond and, make sure to take your profits when up.\n\nEmphasis: If you are up on holdings say, 2-3x and feeling risky consider taking half and letting it kind of just ride, so worst case scenario your initial investment is safe. Profits should be taking along the way. According to my calculation with a 5.5 billion dollar market cap it would need to reach 11 billion to really 2x, which is possible but seemingly buying at such a high price can cost you, your invesment.\n\nShady Facts: The source code is not available the currency could be 300 lines of code built off Binance smart chain. The APY is unsustainable and in my opinion is a plot to get people to hold even longer. They sell merch, which is not evil, but it is un professional to an extent, as this is likely a way to capitalize. \"SafeMoon\" sounds almost too obvious, that this was made to blast off with the intentions of benefitting the \"developers.\" And last but not least their \"Roadmap\" does not go past the end of 2021... Mhhhhm does not look like it was meant to last long.\n\nMy Theory: The trending of Safemoon online is likely to be a result of botting  to an extent. There is a saying \"The amount of time it takes to build something, is the expected time it can take to fall.\" or something along the lines of that so take with with a pinch of salt. I am saying in summary that it pumped so hard from march to now, arguably the fastest growing project, something like this is not from a \"decent\" project, rather a well thought out marketing strategy to get unknown youtubers to endorse it, because all they do is talk about shitty projects that literally dump the next day. My thoughts are people probably got some private presale and are holding some bags, they are up 10-100x so sooner or later they will have to take profits. The project itself is like any other DEFI and NFT project, it does not make any sense it is like any other, the coin may have some utility just not anything special in my opinion.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor but I must say I first heard of bitcoin at 600 Usd (2016) and have went through a bit of scammy projects and nearly fell into one recently. I am aware this may or may not add credability but my advice is to be careful chances are you are too late with these coins and it may backfire quite soon (down 29% at the time of publishing.)\n\nThat is all, thats my two Safemoons' worth, and remember no matter what happens never sell your bitcoin.",

            "text": "Thought this story is worth mentioning. Mostly because even Binance CS couldn\u2019t answer my question.\n\nI\u2019ve opened an account from Hungary on Binance at the beginning of December. My personal details have been verified in a few hours.  \n \n\nAfter that, I\u2019ve deposited 300$ from my debit card (SEPA wasn\u2019t available). Then I started to trade with my account and 3commas bot (Smart trade only so far). Everything was looking fine, and then I noticed that my address could not be verified. The button was not active.   \n \n\nWrote a few tickets to CS but didn\u2019t get an answer from them. Days have passed without any response, so I wrote here in the this sub and the admin responded. My ticket has been escalated. Great! After some time has passed, I got a response. It was a beginning of a long road.   \n \n\nI answered them and no response, so I wrote the admin to escalate my ticket \u2026 again. This went on for over a week until my address verification was completed. It\u2019s over\u2026 finally. Nope. It\u2019s not over.   \n \n\nAbout 2 weeks later I checked my account and noticed that I couldn\u2019t deposit FIAT. Both SEPA and debit card were out of the game. Don\u2019t know how or why but my address verification has been set back to unverified.   \n \n\nWrote another ticket regarding this issue. Yes\u2026 you guessed it right. No answer from CS. After 2 days I\u2019ve checked out of curiosity, and my address was verified although CS never responded to my ticket. (A day later they sent me an automated response, saying that it took longer than usual to respond to my ticket so they assume the issue has been solved\u2026 I mean\u2026 it has been solved.).   \n \n\nBut here comes yet another twist. I still can\u2019t deposit FIAT. Wrote another ticket. No response for days. Tought about nagging the admin here but eventually decided not to. So I started a chat on Binance.com. After about 2 hours someone finally came and answered me. The person was very helpful. I\u2019ve been told that he/she can\u2019t do anything about my issue but my ticket has been escalated and I should get a response in 1-2 hours.  \n\nOne and a half days later still no response from CS, so I started another chat session on the website. 296 in line. Had time to go grocery shopping and after about 2 hours I was 40ish in line. (The last few ticks on the timer happen a lot slower than the previous 200. But CS responded.) We talked a bit and this CS representative was able to give me an almost adequate answer. Here is the important part of the conversation:\n\n  \nBinance CS: I was able to confirm that all Fiat channels had been disabled for your account. You will not be able to use this channel for Deposit and Withdrawal due to risk issues that you have committed. I don't know the reason why myself and please don't tell me as well. Our channels are not transparent about these things so your only option to buy now is thru P2P. Your crypto deposit and withdraw functions are not affected. Let me know if you need anything else.\n\nMe: Ummm... Okay. And who can tell me the reason?\n\nBinance CS: We won't be able to tell you the reason. What you need to know is that all Fiat channels are now disabled on your account and there is nothing else we can do about it. Your only option to buy crypto is P2P trading.\n\nMe: Hmmm. That's messed up. I ordered a Binance card from you. Will this affect the purchase I make with that card also?\n\nBinance CS: I don't think so since Binance card are funds from your Wallet and not related to your fiat deposits.\n\n  \n\n\nAnyone of you had this problem before? Could it be solved?\n\nBinance is a good site with many trading options etc. But the fact that they can\u2019t tell me what the problem is \u2026 well it\u2019s ridiculous. And depositing fancy internet money through P2P after all this? Leaving Binance is something I tought of but Coinbase is out of the question. I tried to open an account there, but my account review is pending since 2 months and they won\u2019t even reply to any of the 7 tickets I opened.",

Photo with id, drivers license and recent bills establishing residency.  Obviously I noticed while in this process having a home address on my drivers license in New York may be an issue so I used another home I have (my wife\u2019s old home that we both now rent out) in New Jersey so offered that up as an alternate address knowing New York may be the issue.\n\nLong story short I like I\u2019m sure thousands of others are completely in the dark with what\u2019s going on.  I\u2019ve sent in my verification docs with memos over a dozen times since Christmas with ZERO response.\n\nThere\u2019s a significant amount money now tied up in this mess called binance.us and I, like I\u2019m sure many of you are fed up.\n\nI used a vpn to try and log into my account recently and now it says my account is banned - that was new bc it had been saying \u201cnot verified go to website\u201d or something like that for the last three months.\n\nI\u2019m an attorney by trade and I\u2019ve threatened bringing a class action in my last two communications.  That also got crickets.\n\nI\u2019m thinking now that we get a large group and mobilize a legal action.  I can\u2019t think of any other way.  \n\nIf banned in New York fine, i get that, but customers should have the opportunity to remove their funds.  The matter is really not that complicated.\n\nCome on CZ was super impressed in your vision and to do your supporters dirty like this is wrong.  No feedback to guys about their hard earned money come on man.\n\nFortunately I\u2019m not in a desperate spot where I need the funds for anything but I guarantee there are those out there missing school, rent and mortgage payments with funds tied up by YOU.  It\u2019s not ok.\n\nIf I can find enough plaintiffs I\u2019d love to round up a class action if there isn\u2019t one out there already.",

Therefore to send out from Trust you have to have some spare ETH, BNB or whatever is needed to pay the fee.\n\nVTHO, ALGO and XLM transactions can be paid with the coin itself, so no problem. BTT transfers can be paid with BNB or TRX. DOGE and ADA can be paid with the coin itself or with BNB. So I'd advise you to use BEP2 (BNB) whenever possible as it's cheaper and to store some BNB in the wallet with your other coins.\n\nLastly, Trust integrates some swap and some exchange functions, but both are limited to only certain pairings (for example ADA can be sold for BUSD only, but BTT can be sold for BNB only. XLM is not even listed \ud83d\ude02). Moreover, there is a small spread, so it might be convenient but not advantageous.

With new features that I will explain this could go parabolic and do a 1000x! I have seen other projects with no real use reach $2m market cap, so what can a coin with a use achieve? Much more!\n\nThis project is already established and 100% transparent. It has an excellent active team. It is also SAFU so there is no migrator function, reducing the risks of \u2018fast scam\u2019 \u2018pyramid scheme\u2019 like projects that run the false title of \u2018SAFE\u2019. As their docs say, there has been \u201ctoo many rug pulls lately in the BSC space have eroded the community confidence over honest teams and reputable projects. Crypto can be extremely profitable for all the actors involved, still being honest, loyal and transparent to the community\u201d. Don\u2019t just take my word, look for yourself (link below)\n\nLlamaSwap is a yield farm staking platform on BSC (meaning cheap transactions). It is Pancake/Goose fork, but do not let that put you off, here me out. The projects aim is to develop on the already successful DeFi projects, such as pancake, developing a healthy community with upcoming \u2018Gambles\u2019 (to create a unique burning mechanism) and a hugely anticipated NFT game! \n\nThe developers often write articles with their views on the current market and happenings (link below), it is a fun read! This shows their knowledge and active dedication to improve their product.\n\nThe tokenomics seem fair and well thought out, with fees collected from farms and pools used for periodical buybacks and burns. Tokens are distributed with farmers getting 90.9% of the rewards per block and the devs getting \\~9.09% of the rewards per block. A separate, dedicated wallet (the burning wallet) receives a portion of the bought-back LAMAs in order to stake them in the staking pool. This way, LAMA keep the APY lower and help sustain LAMA value. There for, all ultimately benefit.\n\nAn excellent road map! Unique Lottery and gambles to flood you with LAMA prizes AND keep the supply under control. With fun and innovative games under construction that I can\u2019t wait for such as Llama or Drama! Also, NFT collectibles that have a use! Yes, they will not just look pretty, they we be usable in games giving them value. These will be delivered hopefully in Q2 and Q3, with more also in the pipeline (link below).\n\nOn top of Lama token, used for farming, the next phase of the project will introduce a utility token called SPIT, that will be used for all new features like those mentioned above and also something new for crypto, binary options trading, to quote the dev \"this is HOT! We\u2019ll reveal more info soon) ;)\".\n\nI can\u2019t see a fault in this token so far! I love the product and the massive potential possible, and I\u2019m really excited to see this small, amazing community develop!\n\nLinks Mentioned \u2013 \n\nSecurity: [https://docs.llamaswap.finance/#/security](https://docs.llamaswap.finance/#/security)\n\nTokenomics: [https://docs.llamaswap.finance/#/tokenomics](https://docs.llamaswap.finance/#/tokenomics)\n\nRoadmap: [https://docs.llamaswap.finance/#/roadmap](https://docs.llamaswap.finance/#/roadmap)\n\nLatest Article: [https://llamaswap.medium.com/the-emperor-wears-no-clothes-3858e1e5cba3](https://llamaswap.medium.com/the-emperor-wears-no-clothes-3858e1e5cba3)\n\nLinks \u2013 \n\nWebsite: [https://llamaswap.finance/](https://llamaswap.finance/)\n\nBscScan: [https://bscscan.com/token/0x0FC013E24AE732fcEc9Eb6BF8CAE12782a56bE7E?a=0xc79a2e763318580076f7609777b9862dc06886c1#tokenInfo](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0FC013E24AE732fcEc9Eb6BF8CAE12782a56bE7E?a=0xc79a2e763318580076f7609777b9862dc06886c1#tokenInfo)\n\nPancake: [https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x0FC013E24AE732fcEc9Eb6BF8CAE12782a56bE7E](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x0FC013E24AE732fcEc9Eb6BF8CAE12782a56bE7E)\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/LlamaSwap](https://t.me/LlamaSwap)\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/llamaswap](https://twitter.com/llamaswap)",

It\u2019s just such a shame the customer service is absolutely appalling and can have people waiting months to even have their issue resolved. Being given false promises and then no message back is really not a good look on the company\u2019s behalf.\n\nBefore I could get my cryptos on my cold wallet my ability to withdraw was suspended due to \u2018risk management\u2019. This was due to a chargeback error to my card because When depositing money into Binance, the reference on my bank statement would ALWAYS show as \u2018BINANCE\u2019 but on a couple of occasions something else showed up on my bank statement - \u2018BUY DIGITAL ASSET\u2019. This actually flagged up with my bank because of the different names and because of that the money the sum of \u00a3445 was returned back to me. I also let Binance know via email as soon as possible that I was concerned and if they could confirm that \u2018BUY DIGITAL ASSET\u2019 is another reference they use when making deposits onto the exchange. But I received no reply whatsoever but an automated email.\n\nSo after a few weeks I called the bank to give me an update on the issue and double check what was going in regards to the two different names showing on my bank statement being \u2018BINANCE\u2019 and the other \u2018BUY DIGITAL ASSET\u2019. It turns out upon further investigation it was in fact just a human error and the \u00a3445 was re-debited back to my self. (Which I had no issue with) I paid this amount off in full and I\u2019ve made sure to keep Binance updated a long the way too. But my suspension still remains.\n\nBut now they just seem to be ignoring me, it\u2019s just unnecessary stress and Whilst I understand that the servers may be busy with support tickets, it doesn\u2019t justify not getting a response for days on end or even months. It\u2019s all just quite off putting. \n\nHope you can help out, it\u2019d be much appreciated",

Anyone in the same scenario?\n\nDecided on using Exodus Wallet for some staking options, as well as Nexo. \n\nNot sure which exchange to go to either.",

Some had already experienced this, and at least ~10 redditors have reported their accounts being suspended within the past week.  A few report that this happens after they unsuccessfully try to purchase crypto using their debit card.  At least two users report that their accounts were frozen after they made some big purchases using their Swipe card, and I have seen a couple of others report that their accounts were frozen after they purchased crypto in the Swipe app, and then moved it to an external wallet instead of loading their card.  \n\nMaybe these accounts have triggered fraud detection, and there are legitimate reasons for this, but I don't get that sense, and Swipe doesn't seem to be willing to acknowledge the situation let alone reply to it, so they don't get the benefit of the doubt.  Most users who contact support report that they receive no reply.  I waited several days to post this to see if Swipe would address the situation, either publicly or privately amongst those affected, but no.\n\nOne user reported getting their funds back after a similar situation, but they claimed to contact support 14 times (mostly without replies), and they eventually had to threaten legal action to get anything done.  One user reported being told by support that after seven days, either his account would be functional again, or it would not be, which would indicate that Swipe had confiscated (i.e. stolen) his funds for good! One user has reported that he was able to reach out to someone on Telegram, and have his account reopened, but only one.  Others explicitly report no reply from support after several days.\n\nBinance - do something!  \n\nThanks,\n\nA concerned SXP holder\n\nPS - more info here:\n\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/Swipe_io/comments/jb00jd/never_retry_failed_topups/](https://old.reddit.com/r/Swipe_io/comments/jb00jd/never_retry_failed_topups/)\n\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/Swipe_io/comments/jaw7mm/suspended_account/](https://old.reddit.com/r/Swipe_io/comments/jaw7mm/suspended_account/)\n\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/Swipe_io/comments/jcyd9o/account_disabled/](https://old.reddit.com/r/Swipe_io/comments/jcyd9o/account_disabled/)\n\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/Swipe_io/comments/j2p7do/how_to_i_get_swipe_to_give_my_funds_back/](https://old.reddit.com/r/Swipe_io/comments/j2p7do/how_to_i_get_swipe_to_give_my_funds_back/)\n\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/Swipe_io/comments/jfhn6f/do_they_ever_resond/](https://old.reddit.com/r/Swipe_io/comments/jfhn6f/do_they_ever_resond/)",

            "text": "Dear Binance,\n\nI need some answers on Binance visa card which I was not able to find on your site.\n\n1. the card fee of 0.9% will be charged in BNB? Considering the lowest cashback of 1% there is basically no fee - correct? I can even calculate my cashback as **current cashback rate** **- 0.9%**? In other words everytime I make purchase with my lowest cashback of 1%, in reality I will be given simply 0.1% in BNB as cash back. If I have 2% cashback, I will be given 1.1% from transaction in BNB?\n2. Cashback is based on amount of BNB held in any of my Binance wallets right? Does staked BNBs count into this as well? So if I want to use your crypto visa card with lets say 3% cashback, I can buy appropriate amount of BNB (50) and immediately stake it and it will still count?\n3. What if I will be paying with the card in various fiat currencies other than EUR or USD? With what rate will be my crypto assets converted into this local fiat currency. Are the rates transparent and always available for me somewhere? Can you illustrate this on following case: lets say I need to pay in Alabanien lek (ALL) and I have btc in my card wallet. How the conversion will be made?  \nThanks in advance!",

Yes you can buy instantly when you deposit with ach or debit, but the funds/crypto will be locked until the time period passes which sucks if you want to move it to a wallet for staking or safety. So here\u2019s something I do for a small fee with cashapp.\n\nACH deposits take 10 days, debit takes 5 days before you can withdraw. So what I do is \n\n1. Buy Bitcoin on cashapp (this is where a very very small fee is applied)\n\n2. Send to binance.US via the Bitcoin wallet (free withdrawal, just need a small minimum)\n\n3. Sell the Bitcoin for USD (or keep in Bitcoin as you can buy some that way too)\n\n4. Purchase your desired crypto and withdraw (keep in mind of Binance.US withdrawal fees, I use it for ADA and it\u2019s 1 ADA a transfer to my wallet for staking)\n\n5. Enjoy no lock up period and your coins in your possession with no waiting at all! (Just transfer times of course)\n\n\nEdit: Got messaged about it, if anyone needs a referral code for binance.us Mines is 35104268",

My minimal $100 ACH transfer has been tied up since the 8th of this month. I cannot withdraw my crypto. I mean, since then I've deposited hundreds of dollars with USD to buy crypto, yet, still waiting well over a week to move anything.\n\n  decided to get charged the expensive fees from Coinbase, they lock my funds up a little less of the time but as I watch the market rush ahead my hands remain tied. Then I decided to just move out of centralized finance and go DeFi. I get some wallets but I CANNOT buy crypto with USD in wallets, instead I have to buy crytpo from centralized markets so I can use crypto to by crypto in wallets, but I don't want to trade crypto, just stake. Like Atomic wallet won't let me purchase ADA with USD... God, I feel like I have to open a multitude of accounts just to manage all these alt coins. Am I missing something? \n\nWhy is BINANCE so slow? Direct deposit from my bank account. Clear it already.",

If you make a profit - sell it and keep it as USD until you want to rebuy in or wait those 10 days. It has NOTHING to do with binance.\n\nWebull  - robinhood - anything thats ACH transfere takes TIME\n\n[https://efxfinancialservices.com/news/ach-payment-take-long-process](https://efxfinancialservices.com/news/ach-payment-take-long-process)\n\nWhat I would suggest:\n\nBTC ATM : 8-15% fee - can use and move anytime\n\nCoinbase 2-4% fee - if you want to pay less but transfere fees and such almost the same as the BTC ATM\n\nBinance ACH hold - 0% fees - gotta wait 10 days to move it out of the place.\n\nTime is money - you are paying for 0% fees with ACH vs 8-15% fees at an ATM.\n\nIts your choice.\n\nyou could use bisq or paxful but I would suggest NOT to due to the amount of scammers  \n\n\nThey give you the money in advice as good faith - the money you get when you are waiting for the ACH to transfer is not your money but binance's. They are loaning it to you to use while your transfer comes through. They don't have to do that but they do so you can go ahead and trade and make money.  \n\n\nI got $400 on ACH hold and I\"ve made $60 profit selling thor coins while waiting.",

Capital One links instantly and charges nothing. (Wire transfers would be $30 and even then you have to wait.)\n\nI've used crypto.com which allows debit cards and I think they use Plaid for bank deposits. Coinbase Pro might be an option as well.\n\nMy favorite has been Voyager since they never charge fees except withdrawals and the platform is clean, simple and user friendly. They give you $25 in free Bitcoin for checking them out. (BRY5E4 if you need a code.) \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI wanted a platform to buy ADA to transfer for staking. So far they've been brilliant. I also have the option to earn 5.25% interest if I keep 1000 Ada on the exchange (6.25% for Bitcoin!) but I want to support the Cardano community.\n\nBest of luck!",

The first is basic token. The second is a deflationary token liked SafeMoon. If you ask me, what the tokens are for? They don't have any functions or utility, they are just meme coins/tokens, you can store them in your wallet like any other tokens/coins and transfer to your friends.

It has to be an inside thing, where employees and/or the company know exactly how much is in each account and transfer it out to their own accounts, or a big \"retirement fund account for the starting owners\" where they just pick a bunch of random accounts and steal from all, giving the excuse, \"sorry, not our fault\". thinking I am as dumb as that... duh...  there was no permissions on my end, so they are waiving all the permissions to do the transfers and just notify us after the crypto has already been sent.    Needs to be a large class action lawsuit against them, as they have the duty to not perform transfers unless they are approved on our end, and it is their negligence to be authorizing transactions on their own.  As they state on their website, \"our crypto is safe from hackers and scammers\"   but not from trust wallet themselves.   Big liability here for them.   Have everyone you know that had funds transferred from trust wallet without wallet owner permissions to put comments in here, I will record as many as I can from message boards and send a nice detailed report to Morgan and Morgan.... that will take care of those criminals.",

PancakeSwap was not detecting my 0.5 BNB even though the wallet was connect - I understand this was because I needed BNB Smart Chain (BEP 20?) instead of BNB (BEP 2).  So I proceeded to swap my 0.5 BNB to 0.5 BNB Smart Chain, and Poof!  My wallet is now empty and I have no idea where the crypto went.\n\nWould appreciate some help with this.  From what I've read so far, I should not expect to ever see the funds again.

Whenever I bought something and returned it (or partially), I received a refund in EUR, which is the currency the reseller I bought from used. \n\nHowever, last month I booked a rental car and they reserved a certain amount on my card. The rental car was in USD, but my card history shows the crypto that got deducted and shows the exchange rate with EUR, and also the total price is shown in EUR. Nothing strange there, pretty similar to how it would normally go when making a payment from a European bank. Now I didn't have to pay for everything that got reserved beforehand and the rest of it should get returned to my card. Here is where it gets tricky though since I assume they return USD to my account. My Binance card wallet only shows the following currencies as possible balances:\n\nBNB, BUSD, BTC, SXP, EUR, ETH, ADA, DOT, FIL, XVS, VAI. So... No USD! Quite some time has passed now and I'm getting worried my returned USD is stuck somewhere in limbo. \n\nDoes anybody have any clue whether and how I can add USD to the balances or what the best way is to go about this? Any similar stories are also welcome, it would just suck if my rental car was this expensive!\n\nCheers, and thank you for your time!",

I\u2019ve opened multiple tickets, it has been escalated, I\u2019ve spent hours on hold waiting to text support multiple times just for them just to tell me they don\u2019t know why, their customer service managers are unsure, \u201ctech. support\u201d is unsure, etc.\n\nIt keeps telling me that my \u201caddress verification failed\u201d even after I have tried two different Ledger addresses, and even tried to send it to my Coinbase account for shits and giggles. Yes, I\u2019ve included a \u201ctag\u201d every single time, yes, I\u2019ve tried multiple transfer networks on their site - nothing.\n\nThe only advice that I\u2019ve gotten that I haven\u2019t tried from them so far is to convert my XRP to another coin (like BTC) and then try to send it\u2026 Which is ridiculous.\n\nDealing with a bit of a time crunch here as I\u2019m trying to claim Spark tokens. I\u2019ve Googled around and found some similar stories but nothing that\u2019s really helping me at this point.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nEdit: UPDATE \nFixed\u2026 Not exactly sure how unfortunately but I\u2019ll tell you what I know. The XRP I bought on Coinbase two days ago populated into that wallet and I was then able to transfer a small amount from Binance into that wallet to make sure it worked.  As I suspected it did.  I then transferred the remaining balance to Coinbase as I still could transfer directly from Binance to my Ledger.\n\nFor some reason, I had no problem receiving the XRP to my Ledger / Trinity Wallet from Coinbase. \n\nI was more frustrated with Binance\u2019s lack of solutions for me to try as well as their lack of communication after my initial ticket and issue. I totally get that this is a new frontier, customer service needs a facelift, etc... however, having money stuck on their exchange for more than a week is not how you keep the CX positive.\n\nThe last thing that I will say is that I very much appreciate some of these community members who were actually inquisitive, solution orientated, and came with the correct tone to the conversation.  I understand everyone\u2019s passion and enthusiasm and the space, but if we really want broad adoption with the masses, I believe that we should address peopled concerns with empathy, not vitriol. Let\u2019s not be Crypto Incels.",

(And I know you have a high volume of inquiries, but this should be a simple issue to resolve.)\n\nGive me my crypto please. I have requested assistance last week as I am locked from withdrawing my crypto off of your exchange due to \"risk management\" although this would be the very first. Very first. VERY FIRST, time I would be withdrawing crypto off of your exchange. I just purchased a hardware wallet and I would like all my crypto to be on there, but I cannot due to this \"withdrawl suspended due to risk management.\"\n\nI contacted [binance.us](https://binance.us)'s customer support system, but I have not received a response for a week and this is ridiculous. I withdrew all the crypto that I was allowed to on coinbase without any hitch or hiccup, and I think I will continue to exchange there from now on- and only there. I do not know why my crypto is being blocked from being withdrawn, especially since this is the very first time I am attempting to withdraw crypto, all the reasons stated as to why this would happen are related to past attempts at withdrawing (insufficient balance, incorrect bank addresses, etc.). I am only reaching out on reddit as I have not received any type of response from [binance.US](https://binance.US), I have received responses from [binance.COM](https://binance.COM) stating I have reached out to the wrong support staff (even when I submitted the ticket on [binance.US](https://binance.US)) and I submitted multiple tickets to [binance.us](https://binance.us) over this issue at this point. This is really making me upset as I think what I BOUGHT should be where I WANT IT TO BE. It was so easy to buy from you but it seems like hell to actually get your investment off of the exchange. Please, I need this resolved as soon as possible as I am tired of waiting on it. Thank you.",

However I cannot select GBP as a currency on the drop down box. It will however allow me to make a deposit with my card (it says no fees) in EUR. \n\nMy question is if I choose to deposit say 100 EUR, will this charge my card ~\u00a390 (or whatever the converted amount is) into my account as EUR without me incurring the 2% fee if I was to buy crypto with my card on my binance app. The thing that annoys me about using my card within the app is, for example, it will say ETH is \u00a31535 but by the time I take 2 seconds to get the payment confirmation I\u2019m now being charged as if ETH is \u00a31541 even though when I back out of the confirmation ETH is still \u00a31535, what gives? \n\nI used to deposit to binance through my bank with no fees and no issues, but this has been unavailable to me for some weeks now, and I\u2019m starting to think maybe I should look into another exchange because it\u2019s seemingly dragging on. Initially it said that the payment method was \u2018under maintenance\u2019 and I cannot even see this statement, or, as aforementioned, that GBP is indeed even a compatible currency with Binance.\n\nWhen I first came to crypto a few months ago, I chose binance quite simply because I could buy XRP, whereas it was unavailable on Coinbase. I have taken 90% of my crypto off the exchange and into my cold wallet, and as a result of all this fuss really haven\u2019t purchased anymore crypto since my payment method has been closed down, but I\u2019m starting to lose my patience, and want to continue to buy more crypto a little here and there, but I don\u2019t want to be doing it the way I\u2019ve just described above where I seem to have to pay more than the actual trading price that is presented by the time I get to the card payment confirmation page.\n\nMy dad uses coinbase, and after having seen the price of his fees compared to what I\u2019ve been used to with my holding of BNB and its discount I don\u2019t think I could ever accept fees that high. I also actually really like the binance app, their charts, how I can track my order info, basically for one reason or another I am actually quite a big binance fan and do feel some loyalty towards their platform, so I really want to stick with them if I can.\n\nHowever I\u2019m really not sure how much more patience I have to hold out from purchasing more crypto and I just simply refuse to keep PCA\u2019ing with the payment method available to me on binance. Does anybody have any idea / indication as to when the bank transfer deposit method will be up or running again, or is there some other way I am unaware of where I can get gbp from my bank account into my binance wallet without the fees. Failing this given my stated loyalty / passion for the binance app what other platform would you guys recommend that comes closest to the binance / design or style. After using binance for these past couple of months then occasionally looking at my dads profile on his coinbase app it just reminds me about how much i hate the look of coinbase and how much I love the look of binance. Call me strange but it is what it is!\n\nN.B - Totally unrelated but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve setup my vault and I\u2019m sure I have had comments upvoted since I did, so how exactly is it that people get moons, I don\u2019t get it? Can I buy them somewhere? They aren\u2019t the same thing as the Reddit coins that I can buy right? This isn\u2019t a beg for moons genuinely not entirely sure how it works, but I have been after seeing my moons go from 0 to 1 for weeks now haha, but like I said, even though I have had upvoted comments nothing has changed, is it exclusively you get 1 moon for each upvote on a post and not comments? \n\nMany thanks guys will be upvoting anybody who takes the time to help me with these issues!",

            "text": "I compel Binance, namely, steve_bnb, to please respond to the concerns that I will address below. I have been a huge fan of Binance's work since its ICO stage, but it has come to my attention that there may be something going on behind the scenes. I also encourage the community to contribute to this conversation as well - maybe I am being paranoid, but who knows. This is why I would like to publicly acknowledge the elephants in the room. Please refute or support my observations. I am nowhere near an expert on auditing, so I am asking for help from those who are. We are at, I believe, the brink of mass adoption (couple years down the line), and I believe it is pivotal to act vigilantly against all possible corruption in the crypto-space during the early  transformative stage of validating crypto's legitimacy. Binance is extremely transparent, so I do not doubt that they will respond to these allegations accordingly - it is expected.\n\n1. Stop Loss. The stop loss utility that exists on any exchange is to prevent one from holding onto bags at an undesired price. This feature, as I am sure many of you have experienced, is a trader's lifeline. Nobody can monitor their portfolios 24/7, therefore automation is needed in order to act as a hedge against the risks involved in trading - namely price action volatility that work against an individual. The stop loss functionality to a trader is what a helmet is to a motorcyclist. Would you ever ride a bike without a helmet? What is/are the reason(s) for the delay in adding a stop loss feature? Why was the implementation of this feature not a priority since the beginning of the project? \n\n2. Bot Price Action Manipulation. Don't get me wrong, Binance lists plenty of high liquidity coins (HLC). Why wouldn't they want to increase the throughput of their exchange? However, among the many HLC, we also can observe the listing of low liquidity coins (LLC). There have been allegations made by the community of insider price action manipulation through the means of bot trading. It is far too easy to manipulate the price action of LLC when it is only available through the Binance exchange. EtherDelta does not count because instantaneous trades are not possible - there is too much of a delay to trade with bots in a manipulative manner. Now, this next observation may be a stretch, but, steve_bnb has publicly announced that Cindicator has the greenlight from Binance to be listed, but decided not to do so. They are known to have extremely stringent criteria for exchanges to list their coin. For this reason, paired with Binance already being one of the top volume exchanges, I wonder why Cindicator chose not to list on Binance. LLC that do not exist on any major exchanges are perfect candidates for such manipulation. Finally, It is possible to see the movement of every coin in and out of Binance's wallets, so taking a step towards backtracking the movement of their coins may be necessary. Getting this far in my narrative, I understanding that I am making multiple leaps of assumptions to convey my point of view. I do not dismiss that. I do however want Binance to respond to the very serious concern of bot manipulation. Afterall, suppose that Binance was in fact manipulating price action. How would it ever be known that this is occurring outside of an operational audit?\n\n3. Prior ICO Concerns. Tron had three separate pre-sale events for their tokens on Binance. The first two were in amounts much less than the third event, I will acknowledge this. However, during the final pre-sale event, the ICO page crashed for many hours, about four to six if I can remember correctly. I cannot recall specifically what the community's response was to Binance's explanation for said crashing. I do remember, however, the opinions of several alleged software engineers being suspicious of Binance's justification. Many people received a confirmation that their contribution was confirmed, only to be retracted at a later point. Binance, please take this opportunity to clear up the confusion. It is expected that Binance be thorough in their response if they aim to be a global leader in cryptocurrency exchanges. We cannot let anything get swept under the rug.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I am a huge fan of Binance and love what they have provided for the community. I even tried to convince the r/Antshares reddit to join my personal exodus of ANS from Bittrex to Binance because I was that much of a believer in Binance. CZ even messaged me personally and wanted to \"thank\" me for doing so (he ended saying he will get back to me when things at Binance cool down since he was so busy; seems that he is still too busy).  You can refer to my post history for the Reddit post. Personal ranting aside, justice is at the core of my fundamentals, and I have no tolerance for injustice. Injustice, after all, is the main demotivating factor of mass adoption of cryptos. To truly aid in the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies and their technologies, trust must be established in the global community through complete and utter transparency and accountability. Let this post be one step towards creating that legitimacy. I have full faith in Binance to deliver upon my requests to respond accordingly. Now we wait.",

The alert said I would need to create an account on Binance.us and that my account will be closed in 14 days.\n\nI successfully got my money out of Binance.com.\n\nHowever, I did not find this process intuitive. I ended up spending way too much time clicking around the confusing user interface, trying to relearn how to do things.\n\nHopefully this will save some other people some time. Here's how I did it:\n\nI created an account on Binance.us\n\nI did the required identity verification and multifactor authentication set up.\n\nI logged into Binance.com, where I was holding three different types of coin. I had some bitcoin, which was the easiest to transfer out.\n\nI transferred my bitcoin by doing the following:\n\n1. I went to [https://www.Binance.us/en/usercenter/wallet/deposit/USD](https://www.Binance.us/en/usercenter/wallet/deposit/USD)\n\n2. I changed the coin type to bitcoin\n\n3. on the \"select deposit network\" section on the right side of the screen, I selected BEP2\n\n4. then, on Binance.com, I went to wallet > Fiat and spot > withdraw > crypto, and selected bitcoin [https://www.Binance.com/en/my/wallet/account/main/withdrawal/crypto/BTC](https://www.Binance.com/en/my/wallet/account/main/withdrawal/crypto/BTC)\n\n5. on the right side of the screen, I set the transfer network to BEP2, and then I copied and pasted the transfer address and the memo from Binance.us into the appropriate fields on Binance.com\n\n6. I submitted the transfer. It was completed pretty quickly. After a few minutes, I have my bitcoin in my Binance.us account.\n\nThat was easy.\n\nThe harder part was getting my alternate coins out of Binance.com.\n\nOn Binance.com I had a bunch of ripple (XRP). I tried to do the same thing, but then found that Binance.us does not actually support ripple. I checked my coinbase account to see if I could transfer the coin from Binance.com into coinbase, and found that I cannot.\n\nSo then I tried to convert my ripple into bitcoin or something more universal. To do this, I went here [https://www.Binance.com/en/convert](https://www.Binance.com/en/convert) and set the \"from\" field to ripple, and set the \"to\" field to BNB which is Binance's own coin, I guess, which I assume has lower transaction fees.\n\nBut then, it said that I cannot do this because I was a US customer. For some reason, it let me, as a US customer, send the bitcoin out of my wallet, but will not let me convert coins between each other. Transferring out is okay, but converting between coins is where they draw the line, apparently.\n\nSo I used a VPN to connect to Binance.com with a Canadian IP address. Once I had a Canadian IP address, it let me complete the conversion of Ripple to BNB.\n\nNote: After connecting via the Canadian IP address, I did not need to log into my Binance account again or reauthorize. I was a little bit surprised; you think if they were making it this hard for me to do anything, they would've kicked me out of my session. I was concerned that they would flag my account activity as suspicious because I was rapidly logging in from two different countries in the same browser session... but it all went smoothly. Your mileage may vary, but that was my experience.\n\nOnce the conversion from Ripple to BNB was complete, I repeated the steps mentioned above to transfer my BNB out of my Binance.com wallet and into my Binance.us wallet (the only difference in the process is that it was BNB instead of bitcoin).\n\nWhat a huge pain. I didn't receive any emails from Binance.com alerting me that they were going to stop support for US customers. I wish I'd known about this when this change was about to go through.\n\nI had to leave behind some other coin in my Binance.com account, because the amount of coin I had was too small to convert it to BNB or anything else. Not a huge loss, but pretty annoying.",

            "text": "So here is my story.\n\nI have a Binance Card, which became a pretty important part of my life.\n\nBasically, I convert much of my fiat income into crypto immediately, and put it on Binance. If I need cash, I withdraw it from ATM (usually I use the same ATM in the bank office near my house). I also use Binance Card daily in supermarkets, gas stations, malls etc.\n\nIt worked very smoothly till yesterday, and in general I am very satisfied with it (though it would be nice to see Bitcoin Cash in the list of cryptos supported by Card Wallet).\n\nBinance also gave you some BNB back on every purchase - never doing purchases cause of that, but sometimes it is nice to find some free crypto here and there :-)).\n\nSo yesterday I went to the ATM to withdraw some cash - as usual. Naturally, I put enough crypto to my Card Wallet in advance. \n\nWhen I requested cash from the ATM, it declined the transaction and returned me a paper slip with \"insufficient funds\" note on it. I also got an SMS that my transaction is failed. It was strange - never happened before if I have enough money on the Card Wallet. I decided that there is a problem with ATM, went to the neighboring bank and tried their ATM with a smaller amount. The output was the same.\n\nThen I looked into my wallet and figured out what's happened.\n\nThe system marked two transactions as failed (with having \"failed\" status on Card Wallet transaction page, and SMS confirming that transaction is failed), the ATM rejected the transaction and gave a paper slip on that.\n\nBut for some reason Binance withdrawn my crypto on these transactions!!!\n\nSo we have the situation that the amount of transaction in crypto taken out from the Card Wallet, but cash never paid out.\n\nFortunately, I took paper slips from ATMs with me. I also made screenshots of Card Wallet failed transaction status and SMS. It took around 1 hour to figure out how to contact a live human support on Binance, then I was forwarded to senior support officer, and after a couple of hours waiting I was contacted by Binance guy in live chat.\n\nBasically it was OK experience, may be a little bit slow, but I am a loyal customer and I understand they have tons of work. We finished with the conclusion that situation is pretty clear, was sent to Binance-Swipe team. Promised to get refund on my Binance Card within 7 days.\n\nI am pretty calm now, cause I am a loyal & thankful Binance customer, and it was yesterday only. Also the very first issue with the card I ever had.\n\nJust curious: did anybody have the same situation, yesterday or before? If you had it many times - how frequently does it happen?\n\nDoes Binance really refund money within 7 days, or it might be long-playing sad song? There is not a big amount in trouble, I will definitely survive even if it is gone forever - but if it happens, I will need another primary crypto-fiat bridge. As I am trying to go \"all-in crypto\" in my daily life, so I definitely need A RELIABLE crypto card provider first.\n\nThanks for your comments in advance.",

            "text": "Hey Reddit,\n\nRidiculously long-time lurker, first-time poster here.\n\nMy issue regards a missing ADA deposit from 28th December that I can't get help with it either by raising a ticket or on Binance's Telegram support channel. \n\nOn 28th December I transferred 400 ADA from my Daedalus wallet to my ADA wallet on Binance hoping to trade it. For what it\u2019s worth my wallet currently has 32,879 confirmations of this transaction.\n\nShortly afterwards I receive an email from Binance confirming the deposit, and it appears in my deposit history. Unfortunately, though, the money didn\u2019t appear in the 'Deposits & Withdrawals' main screen which shows your crypto portfolio with equivalent total BTC and USD amounts. I sent a few other coins at roughly the same time and they all went through fine; I even sent 20 ADA later to test the network and that went fine too. \n\nSo later that day I make a ticket stating all this and providing screenshots of the confirmation email and my deposit history crediting the ADA, along with my D&W screen showing no ADA (I traded the other 20 for another coin). Plus all the other information they ask for like the Transaction ID and address. \n\nAfter discovering the Telegram channel here I send a PM to Support 1002, who quite quickly replies and closes my ticket saying: \n\n\"we have transferred it to our it team, they will fix for you asap.\n\nsupport 1002\"\n\nFor anyone that hasn\u2019t dealt with their support before, when they close a ticket they mark it as \u2018solved\u2019 preventing further replies.\n\nAt this stage I take it on face value. But a few days pass, it still isn't appearing in my account and I figure I\u2019ll go back to the group and ask generally what kind of turnaround time you can expect on an issue like this. To do this I've been constantly checking the Telegram channel looking for which customer support are available and PMing them. I don't agree with a system where jumping on an app apparently gives you priority over people who have merely raised tickets via the website's support page, but it seems the only way to get attention. \n\nFor anyone that hasn\u2019t been on the Telegram page, it is a complete mess of people begging for help, desperate people largely being ignored (or being told to stop spamming by a volunteer) at one point my iPhone has an entire page of unread messages to various support agents going back for days on end. Occasionally people are helped, but for the rest of us that just makes it worse as you\u2019re invariably and constantly told by those lucky few to \u2018stay patient\u2019 while we remain locked out of our money. \n\nFinally, I think I\u2019ve got lucky when last night Customer Support 1007 responds to my ticket number by asking for the Transaction ID. Now, the Transaction ID is in the ticket itself as they request it should be, but I reply within 4 minutes giving it to her nonetheless and thank her for taking the time to look at my issue. These messages go unread and I can only assume she finished her shift hours ago now. \n\nThis morning I think I\u2019ve got lucky again as Support 1002 (the same guy as before) replies saying \u201cdone. Your account was credited for 400 ADA\u201d\nI reply: \u201cThank you so much. When can I expect to see it in Deposits & Withdrawals\u201d\n\nTo which he simply replies \u201cYou were credited with 400 ada in utc 2017-12-28 20:54:34\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, this is my whole issue. Everything from my Daedalus wallet to Binance\u2019s confirmation email tells me the money is there. But it isn\u2019t. As I\u2019ve become used to now, he closed my ticket and has been ignoring my messages attempting to clarify ever since.\n\nAt this stage I\u2019m about ready to give up. I can\u2019t see that there\u2019s any way to get through to someone willing or able to take the time to look into it. \n\nSo Reddit, is there any other possible recourse for an issue like this? Or is there anyone from Binance on here that might be able to look into it? If so you will see my deposit confirmation, the fact that I don\u2019t have the ADA in my Deposits & Withdrawals account, and haven\u2019t traded it away either.\n\nMy original ticket ID is: #290625 \nAnd the transaction ID is: 42928a8753d749046fc77859e5f0a6bab11ff2c7bb58bedc4139add226cfad8b\n\nOr if there is no recourse for an issue like this, I hate to say it, but as a community we\u2019re begging for regulation.

Since I posted a few posts on the support thread, I figured that it is only fair to post about the resolution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR : \n\nMake sure you have access to your Identification Documents, Records of your account registration date and IP, and also access to the account/address from which your made your first deposit into Binance. You will probably need these information to verify your identity should your account get blocked in some way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTimeline :\n\n16 April - I want to trade some ETH for USDC. I deposit my ETH into Binance, trade it all into USDC. I do a small test transaction to make sure I have everything correct, it goes through fine. I then withdraw the rest of my USDC, this withdrawal gets blocked. Facial recognition app does not work on desktop nor on mobile, my crypto withdrawals get blocked due to \"abnormal activity\". I submit a withdrawal appeal video, the message tells me to wait 7 days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat could have triggered with withdrawal block? Maybe it was because I was logging into Binance using a VPN that uses dynamic (always-changing) IPs that was not from the country tied to my account. Maybe it was because my withdrawal withdrew all of the remaining crypto on my account. Maybe it was because I was withdrawing to a new address. Maybe it was because I was withdrawing USDC. I don't (and will most likely never) know exactly why. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n24 April - A week passes, I open a chat with customer support. I am told that a CS person will be attending to my case, an email will be sent to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(sometime around) 26 April - My case is closed, with the CS person saying that my withdrawal function has been restored, but this is obviously not the case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n30 April - I open a new case for the same issue. The CS person says that it has been reported to the relevant team, but they still need more time to check my issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n9 May - My case is closed (again) without resolution. I open a new case for the same issue. I am requested to provide identification document picture, selfie with identification document, video verification showing myself stating the date and confirming type and amount of intended withdrawal, as well as the video showing account transactions and email communications with binance. Also requested to confirm the account registration date and account registration IP which might help speed up the review process. All of these information is provided.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n19 May - Another request from CS to provide a video of the first deposit record of this account. The video should contain the whole login process from the sender platform/wallet (non-Binance), and information for the deposit to Binance wallet such as the full TxID (transaction ID), date, and amount. I am also instructed not to use a screen recorded for this video. I took a video showing myself, the support chat, the record of first withdrawal in Binance, the corresponding transaction in etherscan including the originating address, me logging into my Ethereum wallet, and sending a test transaction to my binance deposit address.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n23 May - My account is released, withdrawals are enabled again. This time I login using a fixed IP from the country associated with my account, convert all the USDC to ETH, and withdraw the whole sum in 3 batches to a whitelisted address. All withdrawals are successful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThoughts :\n\n\\- I am not sure how well the \"facial identification\" app works overall, but it didn't work at all for me and seemed buggy. I felt like this gave my more panic/anxiety when my withdrawals were first blocked more than anything else.\n\n\\- More UX stuff : The initial messages / navigation when my withdrawals were first blocked were confusing and unhelpful. Clicking on a \"withdraw appeal\" link on the top banner led to a rejection page stating something like \"your account is not eligible for withdraw appeal\". However, somewhere else there was an option to submit a withdrawal appeal video, which did seem to successfully do something. This confusion and UX made me more anxious and panicked.\n\n\\- I understand if CS needs time to process tickets, and that they may have some time limit / quota for ticket resolution, but closing tickets (either as resolved or for no reason given at all) when the customer issue clearly isn't resolved merely serves to agitate the customer further.\n\n\\- Binance chat video upload has a 20 MB limit, which is minuscule. Luckily, there are mp4 compressors online that can reasonably compress videos, and also uploading the video to Google Drive and sharing a video link is an option as well.\n\n\\- I am lucky to have records of my Binance account registration date and first deposit record in my email. This allowed me to figure out the transaction from Binance's records.\n\n\\- While I was waiting, I was trying to figure out if there was some other way to transfer my crypto from my account even though my crypto withdrawals were blocked. I thought of a few possible ways that were riskier but luckily did not have to resort to them. \n\nBest of luck to those still waiting for similar issues to be resolved.",

I was a bit distracted as I was looking as crypto tracker on my phone and logging in on my PC at the same time.  After I entered my username and password, I got to the 2FA screen (no slide the shape into the cutout game came up, but I did not realize this) and entered my code.  A message came up saying that the code had expired and to re-enter, which I did.  the second time it failed I realized something was wrong.  I then opened up a new tab, made sure I typed in correctly binance.com, logged in successfully and then realized that I had not been given the shape into the cutout game when I tried to login the first time.  I knew something was up and went back to my previous binance login tab and checked the website address.  It had what appeared to be a verified SSL heading, but the site said binance.auction.  I checked the certificate and it said that was valid for *.binance.auction.  This confused me for a sec, but I then realized I had been sniped.  I quickly changed my password twice  and checked to make sure there were no outgoing withdrawals.  My accounts and wallets all seemed intact.  I then checked my email and saw that there was a new login from an IP address other than the one I was using and from abrowser (firefox) I hadn't used in quite a while, so I clicked the \"disable my account\" link.  I then sent an email to binance support briefly telling them what happened.\n\nALSO POLONIEX account users should beware as the IP Address associated with the binance.auction site (85.93.20.58) was resolving to Poloniex this morning\n\nHere are some images showing what I am talking about as well as some investigating I did on the \n\n\nUnathorized IP email: [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/CILPBdD.jpg)\nFake SSL location: [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vnahBR3.jpg)\nbinance.auction screengrab 10 AM EST: [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/CtyfJSz.jpg)\nbinance.auction IP Poloniex resolving this morning: [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/l5sx6dS.jpg)\nChrome Tile inspection of binance.auction: [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/W2RJLeg.jpg)\nbinance.auction hypestat lookup: [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/eufmyBr.jpg)\nISP Info?

In any case, I just wanted to make sure that I put this bit of information together to let you guys know, detail what happened to me as fast as I could, and to provide some info so we can maybe stop this bastard.\n\nIt maybe the Wild Wild West in cryptotown these days gang, but lets Posse up and get this muther.\n\n",

            "text": "Hey, there.\n\nI\u2019ve been into crypto for a few months now. I anticipated there would be a learning curve, but the frequent barriers I have ran into in the beginning were unexpected. I did some reading, watched YouTube tutorials, and spoke with a couple people before creating an account on an exchange. I planned out my strategy and the amount I wanted to initially invest and began on Coinbase. Little did I know just one exchange wouldn't be enough as certain coins aren't available on every change. So I went from coinbase to Crypto.com, Kucoin, Binance, etc. Wallet after new wallet. \n\nBrining on so many wallets and exchanges in such a short period of time is something I wouldn't recommend. I believe doing so slung shot many mistakes that could have avoided had I been a bit more patient.\n\nOther than BTC and ETH, ADA was on my list of coins I wanted to purchase first. I purchased some on Coinbase at first and then some more on Binance.\n\nI bought ADA on Binance a couple of months ago and sent it to my TrustWallet, keep in mind lessons haven't been learned at this point, and as any novice traders does, takes the cheap route. Resulting in a binance pegged ADA. It was more annoying at first as I was going to let it sit there anyways. I just didn't understand why it would that when other exchanges hadn't. It became more than annoying when I tried withdrawing the ADA because it felt almost impossible to do so with my level of understanding of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThat's when I learned what wrapped coins were and you should always check compatibility. As well doing test deposits. I didn't realize I couldn't transfer assets out of TrustWallet as easily as others. I tried to the ADA out a couple of times, but ran into issues so I decided to let it continue sitting there. \n\nI gained some insight and had a few ideas how to get it out of there. With purchasing a hard wallet and being comfortable with where my portfolio is at, I thought it would be a good time to consolidate my assets into as few wallets as possible until the arrival of my hard wallet.\n\nFast Forward now, I wanted to withdraw the ADA and deposit into my bank. I can't use Binance because their always finding ways to prevent me from withdrawing, whether risk management or another bullshit reason. I had been reading different methods, but I was still unsure how well it would work since I couldn't Binance.\n\nThat's when my crypto swapping/exchange/trading decathlon began. Going from binance pegged ADA to smart ADA to BNB to smart BNB. To downloading MetaMask and switching my VPN to Europe so I can use the Binance bridge to eventually getting USDC in my MetaMask wallet. I was planning to send it over to my CoinBase account(i can deposit funds almost immediately into my bank account on Coinbase). \n\nI was mentally drained after hours spent figuring out the process and so happy to be finished. I just sent the USDC over to my Coinbase account and waited. I didn't think much of it and I came back moments later and found it odd that it hasn't shown up yet. I look back at the transaction and my stomach drops as I noticed that I have sent Bep20 to an Erc20 wallet. I didn't think if the USDC would be be wrapped or anything like that, I was just anxious to be finished. Unfortunately, it\u2019s now lost somewhere in the block chain madness.\n\nI don't want any criticism or \u201cyou should have done this\u201d \u201cyou should have done that\u201d. Remind you I\u2019m novice to the crypto world and I think I just a lot of fucking money. Does anyone have any idea how I might be able to gain access back to those funds?",

Dont know how he did it I kept everything secret, all the phrases, just hard copy as it is meant to be. I tracked everything on etherscan and found which wallet is sending funds to Binance and all the transactions. Made a support ticket and send it to binance with the screenshots links and explanation. Went to local police, but they dont know anything about crypto, most of them never heard about crypto. Thing is that this guy is still funding his account to this day with the new ETH from the same wallet where he stored my stolen assets. Those are like houndreds of new ETH, probably stolen from another wallets. Can binance freeze that account? Because I dont think he can withdraw all the money at once, and I am positive that account still has a lot of ETH on binance stored. Will binance make some investigation? Because it is pretty obvious that wallet is a hacker, and even on the etherscan there is a comment couple of months ago that says that wallet is a hacker that robbing people. I am waiting  for the response from binance, but I fear that everything will happen so slow that guy who stole lot of ETH from people will disappear. Also do they need police involved if the ETH is still on the binance from that wallet and they make investigation and come to conclusion that wallet/account is malicious? Can I hope that binance will freeze account and give me back my stolen ETH? or there is no hope?",

I've no idea what country you live in, but I spoke to my lawyer and filed the police report. It's very important, at least in my country, how the crime is judicially categorized. Based on my case, I categorized mine as such:\n\nillegal access to a computer system;\n\ncomputer fraud;\n\nillegal operations with computer devices or programs; \n\ntheft.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMake sure to file the police report, as guided by your lawyer, to the relevant authorities. The law can be complicated and what we may think is clear as day, it's not so much as clear or properly \"seen\" by the law system. \n\nThere is hope, I froze my scammer's account and the police is now in touch with Binance. Don't give up, contact Binance until you get a reply. Binance will require a police report to freeze the account until law enforcement gets in touch with them. With no police report in hand, they can only freeze withdrawals of the scammer's account for up to 48 hours. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou say that the guy will disappear... well, you may be surprised to know that many scammers are stupid. They think crypto is anonymous and that they won't get caught. Please don't give up. 30 ETH is big money. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBinance will work together with the authorities to handle your case. Sucks right now that they have so many tickets, it may take a while to get a reply. And I don't know whether they have a special team that handles such requests or whether such requests go into the main pool. From what I've seen, they may go into the same pool as the rest of the tickets, but I may be wrong. \n\nDon't lose hope. Talk to a lawyer and get things moving. Since the scammer continues to fund that account, it's clear he's an idiot.",

First off, a little background info.  \n\nI live in Canada, own Bitcoin and Litecoin.  I keep my Bitcoin in a GreenAddress wallet and the Litecoin in a Loaf wallet.  I also have a little $ on Quadriga which I play around with (~$650 CAD).  I've been hearing about Ripple the last couple days and decided to jump in.  My first step was to register/open an account on Binance.  I uploaded pics of my drivers licence and photo a holding said license as well as the sign saying \"Binance, date etc\"  While I didn't get an email confirming that I was verified (or any other positive sign really) I proceeded to send the funds I had in my Quadriga account (~.027 Bitcoin) to what I believed to be my new Binance wallet.  Yes, I followed the steps correctly (went to funds, deposit, clicked on the deposit next to Bitcoin and sent it to the address generated by Binance for me).  I received confirmation on my Quadriga screen that the funds have been sent. \n\nHere's the problem.  I can't find the funds on Binance and don't know where to look or where to try and track the transaction.  Anybody willing to help? \n\n\nEdit: I found it on the blockchain and it says the transaction is unconfirmed.  Am I not able to see this on Binance?  I found the transaction by following from Quadriga.\n\nEdit 2: Success!!! Apparently I was lacking patience, it's there now.  Thanks anyways.",

            "text": "Like everyone else, I thought I would never be scammed and I want to warn everyone on this scam.\n\nToday I was called by the \"Supreme Court or Hoge Raad der Nederlanden\" here in the Netherlands that my personal details are used for criminal activities/money laundering. Legal action will be taken against me if I don't comply. I was completely shaking, even though I did nothing wrong. In their story, they want to shut down the other bank accounts in my name and want to store my bank account and cryptocurrencies in safe storage. With a lot of pressure, I send an amount to an address provided to me.\n\nAfter this fact, they also want to transfer my money from my bank account to my crypto exchange and send this across. Even with a lot of pressure that legal will be taken against, I refused to do this. I am an advocate of Crypto, but I still believe that is safer to transfer money via banks. I turned down the phone, I went to the police office and I will have a meeting with them tomorrow evening to discuss everything.\n\nFeel incredibly stupid of course, I lost some amount from my Binance account and I don't think I will ever see it back. Luckily I did not go further to the other exchanges or banks where money is stored.\n\nDoes anyone have tips on how to approach this issue in order to get my money back that was transferred out of Binance to this address?\n\nThe Binance support already said that it is impossible to return the funds from an external wallet. \n\nThere is an official statement on the Dutch site on this topic ([https://www.fraudehelpdesk.nl/alert/engels-telefoontje-namens-dutch-supreme-court/](https://www.fraudehelpdesk.nl/alert/engels-telefoontje-namens-dutch-supreme-court/))\n\nThis is the address where my funds went to: [https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1q9nzxp3m0ughxt85dy5amle0cz02kxa5fe5fwdm](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1q9nzxp3m0ughxt85dy5amle0cz02kxa5fe5fwdm)",

I purchased some BNB yesterday to meet the unit sale price and noticed that some kind of average is being calculated, so now I only have part of what I spent held so far. My problem is that this is only a fraction of what I need to purchase a ticket. Even though it says I am \"qualified for participation\" since I meet the minimum holding requirement\u2013 will I still be able to actually purchase a ticket? I have the impression that this means I have insufficient funds and must wait out a couple of days for the averages to calculate the whole sum. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo ultimately, what I want to know is if I can purchase a ticket if my BNB holding (in x amount of days) does not match the unit sale price by the time subscription starts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

            "text": "# TOP 6 Major Red Flags in NFT Projects\n\n**When you enter the NFT market as a newcomer, you will most likely encounter many NFT projects that sound almost too good to be true. It does not matter whether you have close to zero or years of experience, people still tend to ignore these easy to remember red flags to separate promising NFT projects from the shady ones. To ensure that you don\u2019t make these massive mistakes by getting into a suspicious NFT project, we gathered TOP 6 red flags to not ignore by any means.**  \n\n\nYou can watch a 3 minute video instead: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t99EJu\\_7GAQ&t=58s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t99EJu_7GAQ&t=58s)\n\n# 1. Undoxxed team\n\n**If you look at the project\u2019s website and it does not have links to real Instagram, Twitter, or LinkedIn accounts, do not buy the NFT to prevent the possibility of getting scammed.**\n\n**A doxed team, regardless of skillset or background, adds a layer of trust that there are real people building real projects.**\n\n**Recommendation: Question their discord as to why there is no personal information included. If they cannot provide an answer as to why that satisfies your standards, stay away.**\n\n# 2. Fake Twitter or Discord followers/accounts\n\n**There are plenty of sources that will chat on behalf of the team on their Discord server. For example, Fiverr provides a message every min per hour just for $20. Different websites such as GetViral sell Twitter followers for almost no money that will create an illusion of a reliable following.**\n\n**Recommendation: Do a quick audit, for instance use TwitterAudit. Look through engagement on posts to see if there are any real people or just bots. If the account has 120k followers and only 50 likes, it is a red flag. Also check if any notable people follow the account.**\n\n# 3. Artificial hype\n\n**Most shady NFT projects often purchase celebrity endorsements to generate unrealistic publicity around the project. Big names in the field of entertainment such as Thiago Silva can be hired for a silly amount of money to gain people\u2019s attention in the sketchy project.**\n\n**Recommendation: It is highly recommended to do some research. Dig into whether the partnerships are officially approved or just paid \u201cpartnerships\u201d.**\n\n# 4. Unrealistic mint price\n\n**Hype-based pricing is certainly a real problem in the NFT space. The golden rule to identify a suspicious NFT project is to analyse the mint price. Behind a high mint price there is almost always the combination of hype and FOMO which drives the price unrealistically high. Many projects have nothing of substance to back their price and rely solely on \u201cinfluencers\u201d to boost the price. This results in investing money into those projects because of FOMO and losing everything when the hype dies.**\n\n**Real community builders start the mint price at a reasonable level and do not extract all the liquidity out of the market. Just because the NFT project can demand a high price does not mean they should.**\n\n**Recommendation: A project that allows the original minters to participate in an affordable way is what builds loyal supporters of the project to stick through the storm and lulls. As an opposite, projects that mint at ridiculously high prices often have difficulty finding support during tough times. Therefore, it is important to invest in projects you truly believe in.**\n\n# 5. Predatory tactics\n\n**Floor sweeps: Sweeping the floor in the NFT world means when a specific project buys all its minted NFTS at the floor price. The floor price is the minimum \u201cask\u201d or the lowest price an NFT can be sold on the secondary market. It is the most popular metric for tracking a project\u2019s performance over time and its relative success compared to others. As an emerging project, floor sweeping can be a method to attract newcomers by guaranteeing low entry points.**\n\n**Banning members: Another predatory tactic to look out for is banning members for listing below prices. This means a member of the project is being kicked out of the community for selling their NFT at a much lower price than the fishy owners of the projects approve.**\n\n**Echo chamber: A big red flag is the existence of an echo chamber. It is an environment where a person only encounters information or opinions that reflect and reinforce their own. This may limit the information the users consume and promote ideas relevant to the NFT project.**\n\n**Recommendation: Step out of the chamber (Discord, forums etc) for a few days. This often allows for the head to clear so better judgement can be made.**\n\n**Other popular red flags to watch out for are harassments of any kind, threats and piggybacking of popular projects.**\n\n# 6. Meta clich\u00e9\n\n**If the project fails to bring more than little innovation by introducing repetitive meta or roadmaps, be cautious. This can be an alarming indicator that the project is most likely going to take advantage of your money to cover its own interests. In addition, if the project fails to address legality concerns over securities and insurance of tokens, consider exiting the project.**\n\n**Meta is easy to copy, and tokens can be launched only in a matter or hours. On the contrary, real economies take months or years to create.**\n\n**The lack of ability to create proper Tokenomics or P2E for sustainability and longevity is also a worrying measure. For instance, the owners of the Bored Ape Yacht Club can participate in exclusive clubs and areas of the BAYC. This is a good way of thinking in the future and gaining people\u2019s trust.**\n\n**Tokenomics: The goal of a Tokenomic analysis is to understand the potential value of the project by considering all aspects of a token\u2019s creation and management, including its supply, allocation, and distribution. The reason why Tokenomics is so important is that it helps to ascertain the future worth of an asset by giving an insight into the profitability of one asset over the other in the future.**\n\n**P2E (Play to Earn): indicates a type of gaming that hinges on NFT technologies. For example, gamers can play video games and virtual worlds for rewards by making an initial investment in the NFT.**\n\n**Identifying these red flags may be a long arduous journey of separating the real NFT projects from the quick cash-grabs, but once you understand the importance of it, success is guaranteed. Unfortunately, there are no blueprints to follow in this new industry, which means there are no right or wrong ways to approach a project.**\n\n**Start by looking for niches and teams with the ability to execute. Find out who is the founding team, and how they work, what their values and grand vision are. If they show lack in respect, transparency, or communication, consider moving on.**",

This should be a top concern for every fan, given how difficult it is to build a field here. NFL season after season sets its own record for most money ever produced in a single year. That's a good start, but it has to go farther.\n\nFor this reason, I think the NFT should be shown in a variety of development branches, each with its own unique set of abilities and talents. So many intriguing new projects have been popping up lately, so I'm happy to see artists and designers trying new ways. Recently, NFTxCards have piqued my interest. Essentially, this is an innovative and intelligent project. The collection contains tens of thousands of 18+ NFT babes. I wanted to buy all of them. LOL. I'm confident in the engineers' ability to deliver on their promise of incredible functionality because of the amount of effort they've put in.\n\nThe NFT industry as a whole has to evolve. I have no doubt that the future will be bright if we take the appropriate steps in terms of expansion and marketing.",

MetaMotor Remember this name because, in the future, I believe it will be one of the world's most top NFL communities. Their collection of one-of-a-kind NTF automobiles will generate a solid revenue as well as prospects for passive income. For all of us, this is a fantastic chance. Why? It's straightforward.

I will share some info I gathered to get your opinion on gaming NFTs.\n\nEvery day, there are 2 million people who play Axie Infinity, which now is worth [$3 billion](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/04/axie-infinity-to-raise-150m-series-b-at-3b-valuation-report/). \u201cGaming is really exciting, as you already have billions of people who are buying digital goods inside of games,\u201d said Devin Finzer, CEO of OpenSea, the largest NFT platform. The reason we haven\u2019t yet seen an even wider adoption, said Finzer, is that \u201cthe development cycle is a little longer with games than with simpler arts and collectible projects. There\u2019s a little more of a delay.\u201d He thinks we\u2019ll see the fruits of these developments within a year or two.\n\nResearch shows that \u201cpeople spend five times more in a blockchain game than in a conventional game.\u201d This inspired Jamie Burke, CEO of Outlier Ventures (a U.K.-based blockchain VC and accelerator lab). He said that skeptics originally \u201cpoo-pooed\u201d this research, but then came Axie. The Axie juggernaut is proof, said Burke, that if the gamer can exit the game and cash out with crypto, and if they\u2019re free to \u201cdo whatever the hell they want with the money,\u201d then they\u2019ll spend more money. \u201cIt feels really obvious now,\u201d he said, predicting that Axie is just the very beginning of a much larger boom in gaming that will be \u201chuge in the next decade.\u201d\n\nNew gaming tokens or platforms will be compared to Axie as far as potential and growth.There are a couple of projects I am looking into right now, like: KittyCake, Aircoins, Momento, StarCoin, Spores and AlchemyPay as my personal Fav! I wonder with these platforms in development, will they see the same succes? In my opinion one of the keys to succes in crypto games is the direct cash out principle. Easy and quick exit with your money makes it appealing I think. What do you think? Would you game on a blockchain game if the money wasn't cashed out to you directly?",

The price is down from highs and has shown signs of recovery. The staking interest isn't due for another reduction until 2025 and we're still gaining traction again which was lost from the stakers we lost due to the last one. I get great rewards from the 2 sources and with compounding it's a great play in the medium to long term. The platform is upgrading massively and its showing no signs of slowing. DYOR but this is one of my comfortable long term plays.",

I think Axie has come too far to end up dead in the water. I\u2019m holding, especially with staking rewards so high on Binance. It\u2019s a great investment in my opinion. As always, do your own research. I think the Ronin hack will be a lesson and it will recover. Cheers \ud83d\udcab",

The advantage of this is that it offers greater clearness, transparency, and predictability to the BNB population.\n\nBinance is also working actively on launching its NFT marketplace which can benefit many other existing projects, by enabling them to access BSC network. Projects like, MetaLopp, Rarible, Faith Tribe can greatly benefit from this launch.",

They are enabling artists, collectors, and players to track their collectable in-game items with their powerful search engine! This can be done across all blockchains and makes them actionable!\n\nWithout a major aggregator unifying all the data in a central place, brands, etc, would lack the ability to organize a digital asset in a user-friendly way.",

I won at the Beeple raffle on Makersplace, the only thing is that I didn't put in a wallet Address line Metamask, instead I added my Binance ETH Deposit Wallet. Because of this I don't have the token in my collection on Makersplace. I've tried reaching out to Binance support since a week but haven't got one single response yet. There live support is working either, i wait for hours for a reply and then at 05:00 in the morning I get a response and the ticket ends.\n\nI have all the evidence for the transaction on etherscan and that I won on Makersplace.\n\nThis NFT is probably more worth than I will ever earn my lifetime... \ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude30\n\nCan anybody help me out with this situation........

Any transaction after that requires 2FA, but I'm not bothered because I set the limit according to my habits. If I want to make  a lot of additional purchases, I can adjust the limit to 2k or whatever, and then back to 1k when I'm done.\n\nIf my session is hijacked somehow, the worst of they can do is to drain 1k/day, but no 100k nft or whatever. Users who want maximum security can set the limit to 0 USD to require 2FA for all transactions, or they can raise the limit to whatever is required for the day, then set it back to 0 when they are done, for a total of two 2FA confirmations (+one for login).",

None of them works but i noticed (after refreshing the page multiple times) that a little message box appears on top of the page and quickly disappears, it says  *\"Sorry, you do not have mint permission\".*\n\nSearched around internet on how to get mint permission on Binance and found almost nothing more than 2 reddit posts asking and some vague answers like \"Binance selected people\" or something like that.\n\nHope someone around here can enlighten me with wisdom about this!",

            "text": "Im struggling with Binance since April so i figured i might share my story.In April, i was one of the winners during \"NFT Tuesdays\". Binance has been amazing for trading AND i am getting some free tokens? NICE!For the competition you had to drop your BSC address, i didn't think of adding my metamask so i used binances BEP20 BSC address.After i've been picked a winner, i haven't gotten anything so i contacted binance.After telling which competition i took part in, i very quickly got a link to BSCscan showing me the transaction.\n\nSo, as you might've figured out by now - i should have used my metamask BSC address.NOW - what happened exactly?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **BINANCE sent me the tokens from my win, to my BINANCE address**\n* **BINANCE sent me tokens, that are UNLISTED ON BINANCE**\n* **the tokens ARE ON MY BINANCE account, but i cannot access them (UNLISTED)**\n\nSo, i've found a relevant FAQ on unlisted tokens deposit and contacted binance again.\n\nIt went like this:\n\nME: \"Here is the FAQ for the unlisted tokens which is my issue. Here is the the binance wallet address, the BSCscan URL showing the transactions, it's about XY amount of XY tokens which are unlisted, here is my metamask address for withdrawing those tokens. \"\n\nBIN: \"What competition did you win in?\"\n\nME: \"Sent all the data again.\"\n\nBIN: \"Oh yes, the prize has been distributed already. Check the BSCscan. Case close\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nME: Re-open case. Explain again that it's about unlisted tokens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BIN: 6 HOUR WAIT TIME -> turns into days**\n\nBIN: \"Can you provide details, and TXiDs?\"\n\nME: \"I already provided it in this chat, here is the BSCscan link, it's about those tokens, in that amount, both are unlisted - i need to get them out to the metamask address i already provided as i cannot access unlisted tokens on binance due to them not being listed. \"\n\nBIN: \"Which binance competition is this?\"\n\nME: \"Look. I already won. And i already got the prize. I already provided all the information and screenshots multiple times.All i need is getting the unlisted tokens, that are currently on my binance BSC address, out to my metamask account where i can access them. Could you please assist me with that, since i've been waiting since april being stuck explaing the same thing over and over? \"\\*screenshots attached, from the chat convo i already established it in\\*\n\nBIN: \"let me transfer you to this campaings person of contact\"\n\nME: \"I would appreciate it if we could finally get to the root of the problem and transfer the unlisted tokens out to my metamask account. Im waiting on my winnings since april.**YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENT**\n\nBIN: \"You need to contact or send a PM to the support of the place where you got the NFT. In this case, contact support on Twitter.\"\n\n**Cue me being confused, because it's not about an NFT but about unlisted tokens - which i won on binance and im contacting binance - so what has twitter support to do with it?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nME: \"Sending the FAQ on unlisted tokens. Explaining my situation again\"\n\n**YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENT**\n\nSo yeah...\n\nNow, it's been like this since April.Explaining what i already explained, case being closed. Re-open, explain the same things, get asked the same things, get transfered to someone else, wait for days, explain again, case gets closed. Re-open and it's the same again.Finally broke out of the support loop, but now i need to contact twitter support?Ymmm, what? \"Hey twitter, binance said to say hi, now gimme my money\" or what do you expect me to do at this point?\n\nIf you think im joking:[https://imgur.com/a/UyDZUMf](https://imgur.com/a/UyDZUMf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n/ed\n\nAt this point im just being transferred from one team to another without a word:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/NE4p4Ym](https://imgur.com/a/NE4p4Ym)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n/ed2\n\nFinally going in the right direction, kinda:\n\nThe customer service agent \"checked the support chat history to help me better\", but the next question shows they somehow didn't. Because what they asked was stated multiple times already, as recently as a couple messages above.....\n\nMaybe somehow they just missed this information, which is unrelevant at this point either way.\n\nBut after stating all the information yet again, i got a form to fill out.  \nApparently it costs 0.001 BTC - but reading binance FAQ says the fee is:  \n 5\\* current withdrawal fee of the exact tokens and is deducted directly from said tokens  \nNot sure what the case is when it comes to unlisted tokens, so that could be alright as the fee is low compared to the stuck funds.  \n\n\nSadly, the form to fill out just let's me add the TXids, token amount, token name and the address in question (the binance address my funds are stuck on).\n\nI cannot add an address to withdraw (my metamask BSC) in this form.\n\nIn case this form would just reverse the payments and the tokens are sent back to the sender address (which would be... binance):\n\nThen reversing this transaction would sent my won tokens, back to binance, meaning that instead of being just stuck on my wallet address due to being unlisted - they would be sent back to binance prize pool address and being gone.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/VfSd1Zp](https://imgur.com/a/VfSd1Zp)\n\nAfter asking my questions, as this is a scenario i want to avoid - it's back to silence...",

This is not financial advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**:\n\nWhat happened at least last time throughout the 14th and 15th and then into the 16th century is what they call the renaissance which is just a fancy word for rebirth. It was a rebirth of not just their economic system or their political system but actually their culture and their identity of how they thought about themselves. Education, off-chain integration, as well as governance, are the three biggest keys to unlocking how we are going to make this renaissance truly impactful. It is not just protesting on the streets or arguing with people on Twitter. These are tangible things that we can do right now to make a very big significant difference in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What Has History Taught Us?\n\nOne way to look at history is as a pendulum swinging back and forth between aggregation and decentralisation.\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages you had power and wealth and economic value was becoming increasingly concentrated century after century. A part of this was aggregated in the Roman Catholic Church but it wasn't just religious and they actually acted as a political entity. The way we can best view ourselves is almost as medieval European farmers. Our world is fundamentally aggregated and pulled together and we exist in this world of hierarchy.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages what happened was that communities tried to coordinate socially and resist this hierarchy and create more free economic markets and exchange information more freely with one another but they could never really pull it off. They were at the bottom of not just the religious pyramid but this political pyramid and each time they tried to do anything they were smashed by those in power at the top of the pyramid. They could not coordinate and communicate ideas effectively with one another nor could they incentivise one another economically and could not share value very efficiently.\n\nWhat happened at least last time throughout the 14th and 15th and then into the 16th century is what they call the renaissance which is just a fancy word for rebirth. It was a rebirth of not just their economic system or their political system but actually their culture and their identity of how they thought about themselves. The other attempts at renaissance and reformation were smashed each time because they didn't have the decentralised technology to be able to effectively coordinate and build markets and take action. There were two particular new types of technology that allowed this renaissance to actually work last time \u2014 the printing press and double-entry bookkeeping i.e. a ledger.\n\n## Ledger\n\nLedger was absolutely radical at that point in time. Credit and debit and left and right was something new. Medici had rediscovered it from back in the Roman Era. Some of the people talked about it and it was used in North African communities. It was like magic where all of a sudden, the power brokers didn't have absolute control over the monetary system. You could essentially prevent false forks, increase velocity and composability. As a result, there was an explosion of financial technology around this idea of using ledger-based accounting and reconciliation system for contracts. It gave an increasing amount of people access to capital and created a whole proto-capitalistic or proto-economic class.\n\n## Printing Press\n\nWhen we think printing press we think of machines or newspapers or somebody cranking out a Gutenberg bible but most of what was printed was actually images with big words and tag lines. They were almost like the memes of the day. It allowed you to share ideas at scale where previously if you wanted to share a document like an economic contract or piece of literature it would cost you a year's or 10-year\u2019s salary to have a\u00a0scribe make the copy. It was locked away under permission and observability. Being at the bottom of the pyramid probably meant you would not even have rights to access that contract. The printing press allowed the dissemination of ideas at scale and also the openness of these contracts to a lesser degree.\n\nThe technology was fundamentally distributed and decentralised. The power structures did not like it obviously because they had controlled the means of not just economic coordination but also information. They tried to outlaw it but that did not really work very well because it was decentralised in the sense that it only took a couple of hours in a shop off-grid. They tried to KYC it and register printers which didn't work either. They were placed in this no-win situation where the technology was growing so fast and the audience was growing so rapidly that they either had to engage in this battle back and forth or they could ignore it and so they ended up engaging it and so the printing press actually created its own market.\n\nOnly like five percent of people were literate at that time. You could not afford or have access to a handwritten document and it went from being a year's salary or 10-year's salary to being the cost of a chicken, essentially. Many families could then access these new radical ideas and these radical ideas created a market which created literacy as folks gained more and more access.\n\n# How Can Tokens Coordinate Market Creation?\n\nSociety is good at small micro skill coordination where people are physically near each other like small little villages but when we start transacting across the internet or across jurisdictions or across geographical locations then it becomes very hard to coordinate. This is where the power of tokens can really come in because a market is basically just this common ground where a buyer and seller come together to trade and transact, which is coordination. The difficult part is to figure out how we get everyone to come to this common place to trade and how do we use this technology or this platform. This is one of the biggest benefits that tokens can bring, which is a tool for incentivisation.\n\nPeople only do things because they are incentivised to do so. Adam Smith once said that the butcher in the shop does not cut meat because he is worried that you do not have anything to eat. The butcher is incentivised to do that because he is paid to do so. People behave in response to incentives and we need more coordination to create markets for people to trade. This is where the network is formed and the value is formed and we can use tokens to promote that coordination.\n\nIn the previous world, you had to trade through centralised aggregation. There were maybe like four markets a year and only in select locations so if you wanted to sell your goods you had to go to that place at that time and there were only these limited windows. This was essentially because the markets were dictated from on high. They were allowed (granted permission) and the people who controlled the coin said we are going to set up shop here and we are going to not only take a piece of it in the market but also going to tell you when you can transact with anyone else. This setup limited the amount of money that flowed through a market as well as a person\u2019s connection with someone else.\n\nWhat happened with the advent of ledger-based accounting was that it broke those markets apart, so, basically, decentralisation happened. Our token is essentially an updated form of that sort of double-entry bookkeeping that allowed us to transact as a market in a decentralised way. It means we can do it more than four times a year and we can do it more than just at certain appointed places so it allows the markets to become local and to become super small.\n\nWe can have a transaction not only without a mediator but at our time, at our pace, and on our own terms around a contract that introduces greater degrees of freedom into a market with much greater access in terms of time as well as space geographically, and that has massive benefits to markets\n\n# Crypto Success: How Can Everyone Get Access To It?\n\nWhat happened historically was that you had a few haves and everybody else was have-nots. Then when the technology arrived there was a rise in the middle class. We are now in a different situation where we have this aggregation but also have kind of this lump here and so we are going to have the opposite and instead of everybody moving towards the middle there will be a pulling apart. We are already starting to see that because part of technology like AI taking people's jobs. Crypto is different than just the replacement of economic inputs \u2014 it literally gives us the opportunity to become new artisans and capitalists.\n\n## Education\n\nThere is usually an adoption curve, and the first piece is education. We need to be doing more education and not just foundation and protocols but also about core economic concepts like how do you improve your life and your situation.\n\n## Adoption\n\nPart of crypto's success will be in its adoption and by that I mean: does crypto become the new rails for banks or better blockchain technology for IBM and Amazon, or does it live up to the promise of social coordination of community? It is going to be a foot race to adoption which does not necessarily mean just pure economic token design or DeFi, but actually crypto intruding into the real world and acting as an economic battery to power real-world businesses.\n\nWe are starting to see that now with NFTs and art. If you look really carefully you will find places where crypto is moving into the real world to drive adoption like play to earn, but also these little things like Helium which is an example of a little box and a broadcast internet of things and now it is also starting to do 5G. If you are a small business owner or restaurant owner, you can run this box and if you are early in your space then you are earning five, six, or even seven figures so literally by running this box and an IOS app you have already paid value into your space and your rent and now you are broadcasting it.\n\n### Current State\n\nRight now DeFi is awesome, but if global stocks are 200 trillion dollars and global bonds are 200 trillion dollars and crypto is 2 trillion dollars then it is just a little tiny piece of it. But if I can actually have on-chain rights for those assets like insurance or options or things in the real world then I would start sucking the real world into crypto and that will allow me to interact and grow.\n\n### The Future\n\nThe future adoption of crypto includes a circle of people coding python or solidity and then there is another circle figuring out DeFi and token design and economics. Then there is this broader circle of people who do not care about any of it but want to use it as an economic battery to support their business in real life, and then there is a broader circle still about education.\n\nThe interesting thing about crypto is that it is just so fundamentally antithetical and inside out from AI. Crypto is inside out and upside down and it gives asymmetric advantage to the little person on the long tail instead of at the centre. From that perspective, crypto literally allows these opportunities by removing mediated places so we can create markets and express value for things that do not work within an aggregated system. All of a sudden esoteric knowledge becomes valuable like I might be a teenage mutant ninja turtles collector and I can use Upshot on NFTs. Crypto provides this opportunity for everyone but the question is: is there going to be a re-emergence of neo banks or is it going to be everyone having access to crypto? If it succeeds in everyone having access then it will have been through education and real-world intrusion and adoption which is just starting to happen.\n\n# Value Creation\n\nValue creation has shifted from the religion of \"money is everything\" to \"as soon as you provide value and someone accepts that value, then you are valuable\". This is the new world's UBI. UBI is not just about money but about the resources or the energy required to run a node so that you can use it to create different kinds of tools that can be given to other people. This is real value creation because why would I want to put trust in a government that is just printing money and inflating it when I myself can create that value and it can be shared!\n\n## Is It Inevitable For Us To Recreate The Middle Layer As There Is A Proliferation Of These Apps?\n\nIf we look at human productivity as a linear line then we have very unproductive people and very productive people. Machines are coming in to take over that middle layer and then we will start to define what the new middle layer will be, which is integration between machines and humans. We are segregating this line into more segments, and you have different kinds of middle layers being formed so you have small little boutiques catering to very specific sub-segments of people. A feature of this is that one is able to solve specific needs by this specific segment of people in this timeline.\n\n# Micro Token Economies As Nation-States\n\nWhen we create these little micro-economies we are basically recreating how nation-states work \u2014 the legal structure, the social contracts, and the legal contracts in NFTs. We are talking about citizen rights, on-chain rights, and reputation engine.\n\n## Imagined Communities\n\nThe way you can look at imagined communities is you look at this thing called the social utility function or social optimisation function. As a society we are optimising one main thing at a time and it could be anything. It is very easy to go in and out of the system and I come into this system because I agree with the ideology and philosophy. I buy into the token because I want to be part of the governance to keep growing this.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nOne of the biggest problems with the world today is that we are born in different countries and it is basically a lottery where you are born. It is not fair to someone who is born in Yemen in a crisis period because he or she could be exactly like someone in America but will have way lesser opportunities. However, with technology we can level up the playing field. We can start creating social communities based on common ideologies. You can even have communism or socialism or democracy or whatever political social government systems you want and then you just allow the market to dictate how the communities grow. We can then stop fighting about what social system works as the market will tell us if a social system fails, because no one will be there anymore and no one will want to govern which means no one sees a future in that system \u2014 then there is no point arguing. It is the best experiment ever.\n\nEducation, off-chain integration, as well as governance, are the three biggest keys to unlocking how we are going to make this truly impactful. It is not just protesting on the streets or arguing with people on Twitter. These are tangible things that we can do right now to make a very big significant difference in the future.",

I would like to move it from Binance to my TrustWallet address, but I'm a bit stuck at this point : I can't find how I can achieve this.\n\nI can see that I own this NTF with a TrustWallet Watch Address on the Opensea website, but I'm not able to move it since I don't have access to my Binance private key.\n\nIt's the 1st time that I have an NTF, so maybe I don't understand how it works :)\n\nCan someone enlight me ? It would be really kind!",

I came across this token about 2 days ago and decided to do some more research. I figured out the token had fully doxed devs unlike most projects I have been in in the past. This project has a very passionate community behind it. I spoke to many of the members who were in on day 1 and they had nothing but good things to say. This is always helpful when searching for the next gem. The devs did a live AMA and gave me a personal shout out! I truly believe in WHAT DO YOU MEME TOKEN! This project cares and they are in it for the long haul! The devs have a long term plan of developing an NFT MEME platform. This will be great considering NFTs are blowing up right now. To make a long story short the Owners of this project are actually real which I have never seen in DEFI before. They also have a registered business in the States. There website and team is well put together all the way around. GET IN WHILE IT IS STILL EARLY. I can go on and on about this project but then that would ruin the fun. Come join our TG chat and see for yourself. Oh yeah I almost forgot they are doing a $2500 giveaway for whoever can post the best MEME using the devs faces \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude0d See you There!\n\nPresale live now \ud83d\ude0d\n\nWhat Do You MEME Token is live on DXsale now!

After some talking with Binance support they said I made an NFT purchase for 225 BUSD. Now I have absolutely no idea what the hell NFT is as I am extremely new to crypto in general. The last thing they said is that the blockchain is anonymous and that the purchase cannot be reversed and that I should contact my local authorities. I  haven't seen any suspicious account activity and I'm doubtful about going to the police because I am very probably going to pay them something but I'm in a bind right now, gotta get my car fixed up. So I'm pretty desperate here, was my account hacked and fucked over 200 dollars, or is there something else that might've happened?\n\nEdit: the thing that was bought is \"Paradox Forge\" #6 by \"BigTimeStudios\"\n\nEdit 2:  \n\n\"I am sorry, for what I checked what happened is that the hacker bought a cheap NFT and sold overpriced to you. So I am afraid that the artist wouldn't be able to help in this matter. I am really sorry\"\n\n\"The suspect's account, which we have successfully located (but was unfortunately emptied), had sold an overpriced NFT to your account. That is how we were able to locate it\" - what Binance support said",

I have a problem with \n\na) People listing in BNB clearly to try low key scam people not paying attention - i nearly fell for this - let us sort by currency please at least. \n\nb) They removed the ability to sort by lowest price first - why? Again this is something that will just benefit bots and scourers. If we want to see the lowest listed price for X item we should be able to quickly and easily do that - that is what a market is for. \n\nc) Overall rarity of drops isn't great, it should have been tiered more Rare drops having 6% chance to drop and normal being a 8% drop chance is hardly going to give much more value to something. \n\nd) Seems like we can't see the bid history for the mystery boxes or nfts?\nI think it is a cool idea for a first launch, but i doubt the NFT's will be worth much more than they are now... ever.",

But now I'm looking at binance because its faster speeds are looking pretty favorable. As a growing developer, I have ideas about projects I want to start but I have a few questions. \n\n1. Is ERC20 and BEP20 similar in terms of coding in solidity?\n\n2. Can I make some sort of BEP721 (like ERC721 aka NFTs)? Is there any sort of list of these besides BEP2 and BEP20? I know of like 20 different ERC standards. I can't find any other BEP. \n\n3. For a simple BEP20 token, assuming no major project backed behind it, how much would you guys estimate deploying will cost? I know it varies a lot but if I have around 5k to spare, is it worth getting serious about this? Or can someone give me some range or rough idea as to how much projects cost? Is it cheaper than deploying onto the ethereum network?\n\n4. Can a programmer single handedly get a token onto a dex like pancake? If there is a solid project and web page with real support behind it, would it take a long time to get a coin onto a dex? Is it even possible? Is it worthwhile for someone who is mostly looking for a profit?",

Cryptoracing is a racing simulation of cars in which people have to buy their car squad and armor them with various parts.\n\nFor example, your team create 3k points/second and the total is 100k points. So, you will be rewarded 3% from the pool. I will tell you more at the end of this post. 4. Those productions you made are match points and you can deposit them into the match funding pool. In there, the portion you get will base on the the percentage you contribute to the pool. It is just like the number 3. The large pool is created by the contribution from all players. 80% of the BNB consumed by players in purchasing cars, opening toolbox and setting diamonds will flow into the bonus pool. We use 8% of the bonus to share dividend each day. 4% for the productivity pool and 4% for the match funding. In the bottom line, the more the players come and the more they spend, the more the community get. So, what are you waiting for? Come and invite your friends to race to the moon!!!",
