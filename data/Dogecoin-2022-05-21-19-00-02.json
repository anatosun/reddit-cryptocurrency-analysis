A ridiculous war of who has the highest number of utility buzzwords sprinkled throughout their white papers snowballed.    This generated massive numbers of shills and parrots all spouting nonsensical arguments and propaganda revolving around the idea who has the most utility.  Terra UST/Luna pair has one of the longest bullet point list of utilities I have personally seen.  RIP.  It won't be the last either.   A lot of fake utility will the sink to the bottom of the ocean. Platform coins too.",
