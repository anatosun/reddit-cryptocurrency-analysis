I think I understand now what you mean by a bullish crossover on the MACD.\n\nAfter reading that article and looking at the examples, what I see is that when the crossover occurs it is kind of like putting the expected trend on hyperdrive. So if it looks like it's about to trend upward and there's a bullish crossover it zips upward really fast in an amazing way. Conversely, the same is true if it is about to trend downward and there is a bearish crossover, it puts that bearish trend downward on hyperdrive.\n\nSo I guess you could say, the macd is kind of like putting the gas pedal on a certain direction given the context of the current price action. In this case with doge, it looks like we're about to trend upward and so the coinciding macd is going to make that trend go upward super fast like a rocket?",
