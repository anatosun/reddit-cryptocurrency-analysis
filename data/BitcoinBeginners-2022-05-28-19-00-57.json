I'm just curious if there is a mathematical relationship between number of adopters (those who hold $100 or more worth of bitcoin) with respect to the value of bitcoin. I assume more people = higher price and that fewer people = lower price. Is this thinking correct?\n\n___\n\n**TL;DR:** Is there a minimum number of people that must believe in bitcoin in order for it to avoid a 90% crash in value? \ud83e\udd14",

That is currently around $22,000. It's gone below the 200WMA but for only for a moment. Personally I think 18k-22k is well within play and an absolute low of 10k this cycle. Although I don't think it would hit 10k. 84% down from ATH of 68k would be $10,880. So it's possible for sure.\n\nTo answer your questions the more spread out bitcoin is the less volatile it will be. This will take a long time though. There are still many singular holders that possess large percentages of BTC. Could take decades if not longer to thin it out. This cycle should tell us a lot. If 22-25k is the low then that means only a 60-70% drop instead of the normal 84%. If that happens then that answers your question right there. Look back at 2018/2019. BTC was hitting a 6k-ish low for almost a year before dropping another 50% to around 3,200 around the end of 2018. It stayed in the 3k-4k range for about 3 months in 2019 IIRC. Then it hit around 3,800 again in 2020 for COVID crash. That didnt last long though. Volatility fluctuations, of 10-20% only, could still take decades.",
