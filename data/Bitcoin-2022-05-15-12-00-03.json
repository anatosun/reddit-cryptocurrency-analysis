Once NFTs came around I quickly jumped to the sidelines, and given the current price action, I\u2019m sure glad I did.\n\nI\u2019ve always been carefully to try to conceptually track enthusiasm with *actual* progress, and a lot of people here wouldn\u2019t be holding bags if they did the same. \n\nI\u2019ve been around here since 2016, and in the past few years have just been listening and monitoring the subs for the past few, but I\u2019ve been more inclined to actually start calling people out on how ridiculous they are, against my better judgement. My current impression is that the prevalence of posters left here are people losing money and looking for any assurance they can get, reason and real analysis and reflection be damned.

There is legitimate risk to self custody and it has to be properly weighed against the risk (and convenience) of third party custodians. For every exchange that has a high profile issue there are probly hundreds of individuals who\u2019ve accidentally lost their coins, but we just don\u2019t hear about them at scale. You can say people need to be smart enough to self custody but the difficulty level and inconvenience of it is absolutely an issue that hinders large scale adoption",

The whole point is freedom to choose, if people don't want self custody, or want to use whatever currency, they should have the freedom to. Even if they don't like bitcoin, the fact that it would be in the market competing against inflationary currencies would keep them honest and improve their quality of life. \n\nJust the fact that we have crypto now puts these banks in a hard place, knowing that the more they inflate the more business they lose to the new competition. \n\nThe free market and competition used to be the cornerstone of our way of life, now apparently it is laughed at in favor of corrupt monopolies.",

But then the banks began to undermine money by issuing notes for money they didn't have.  This was a criminal racket at first but the convenience and profit potential was too great for governments to pass up it became legitimized.\n\nEver since, people have learned that 'money' is what banks and governments say it is.

In Canada gas prices go up 10% every 2 weeks, \"because the war\" is their excuse, but it'll never come back down. My salary increased 2.7% last year for inflation, haha, 1/10th true inflation. We're getting into hyperinflation territory in the West. USD is weaponized and non-fungible (the US government \"sanctions\" or \"seizes\" aka steals from their political enemies) and any intelligent nations that aren't \"woke\" sheep are reducing their exposure to US assets. Great store of value there, buttcoin cryptos, aka Western fiat currencies.\n\nhttps://techstartups.com/2021/12/18/80-us-dollars-existence-printed-january-2020-october-2021/\n\nEdit: Corrected a percentage",
