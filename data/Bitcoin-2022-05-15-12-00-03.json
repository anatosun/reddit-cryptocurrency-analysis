PERIOD.\n\nI too would not trust myself or most others to be their own *commercial/investment banks*.\n\nI have no problem trusting myself to be my own store of liquid cash.  In the US, you can't do that so easily.  Your options:\n\n1. Hold everything in cash - good luck with e-payments, and get placed on lists when you use the cash for large purchases.\n2. Hold everything in checks - ditto the above, maybe slightly safer than cash to hold in your house\n\nBitcoin lets you participate in electronic banking without the damn bank itself, and the risks associated with cash.\n\nGo to a developing country where the banks aren't so trustworthy and that just sweetens the deal.",
