It\u2019s crazy how few people here open their eyes to the real problems that need practical solutions instead of leaping in a libertarian/chart-addict fantasy world.\n\nI had high if somewhat tempered hopes for all of this, but the progression of this sub, and the amount of people with their fingers in their ears up to the knuckles has really had me question things recently. Once NFTs came around I quickly jumped to the sidelines, and given the current price action, I\u2019m sure glad I did.\n\nI\u2019ve always been carefully to try to conceptually track enthusiasm with *actual* progress, and a lot of people here wouldn\u2019t be holding bags if they did the same. \n\nI\u2019ve been around here since 2016, and in the past few years have just been listening and monitoring the subs for the past few, but I\u2019ve been more inclined to actually start calling people out on how ridiculous they are, against my better judgement. My current impression is that the prevalence of posters left here are people losing money and looking for any assurance they can get, reason and real analysis and reflection be damned.
