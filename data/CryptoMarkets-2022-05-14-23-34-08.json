Of course it is still possible to make money that way but significantly less than before and the investments have to be considerably bigger than before.  \n\n\nSo I decided to explore new sectors and markets to invest in where the profit margins are higher and where it would be possible to make huge amounts of money.  \n\n\nI've reached a conclusion that it would be prudent to invest in sectors that blockchain technology hasn't penetrated to yet significantly and markets that haven't been explored yet that have a huge upside potential.  \n\n\nMy conclusion is that the sector where investments might be wise is the telecommunications sector where blockchain is the inevitable future, and the market would in my opinion ( and I understand that this might sound crazy ) is Africa. Ive heard that some companies like World Mobile Token and Giant have already started looking that way and that even Google is considering such an enterprise.  \n\n\nMy question to you is do you believe that I am looking in the right direction and would you consider something similar.",
