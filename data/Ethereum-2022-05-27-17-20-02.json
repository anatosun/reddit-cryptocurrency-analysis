Spoke with him a couple months ago at a party over a beer or two. His recommendation was 5:1 Eth:bitcoin ratio. So I\u2019ve adopted that. His firm is extremely bullish on Eth long-term and I independently feel the same way. So I\u2019ve been maintaining that ratio which required me to buy more Eth. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t spend all my money! I\u2019m just slowly accumulating now. It may go much lower. Best wishes in your investing!",
