About the book, he wrote:\n\n\u201cLong one of libertarianism\u2019s finest writers, Wendy McElroy latest book does not disappoint. The Satoshi Revolution is an utterly fascinating and extremely readable account of the cryptocurrency revolution spawned by the famous and mysterious Satoshi Nakomoto. This book is fun, well-written, and will serve as an excellent introduction for those just now beginning to wonder about Bitcoin. But even seasoned crypto enthusiasts will enjoy it and learn a lot\u2014from intelligent speculations about Satoshi\u2019s politics and motivations to the future disruptions and liberations we can expect and hope for from cryptocurrency. Anyone interested in Bitcoin or, indeed, the future of liberty, should read this book.\u201d\n\nNone of you actually DYOR, none of you actually \"understand\" Bitcoin, and this comment section proves it.",

If you're in the US, you can't really go wrong with Coinbase or FTX US. Outside of that, you have a lot of options. I wouldn't suggest dumping all your money in now, maybe every couple weeks you buy a little to DCA (research dollar-cost averaging). Whenever you're ready, you can send the bitcoin on your exchange account to your ledger.\n\nGood luck! :)",
