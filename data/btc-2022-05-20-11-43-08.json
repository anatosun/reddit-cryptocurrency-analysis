If you sell for a loss, you owe no taxes on that (you may want to track it for your own sake as you should be able to use those losses against other capital gains you made, however that's your choice.  The IRS is not going to come after you because you failed to report capital losses.  It's your choice not to report losses).\n\nI bring this up because BCH is now down to around USD 190.  That's almost its lowest point ever, and in its history since the HF 8/1/2017 it has only been lower than this for a matter of weeks (out of 5 years), meaning that more likely than not any BCH you spend now you are selling at a loss.  So no, IIUC the IRS does not care if you do not keep track of your BCH spending if you are not making any actual capital gains.",
