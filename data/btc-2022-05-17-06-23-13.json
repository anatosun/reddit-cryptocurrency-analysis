I\u2019ve made big gains, and big losses, and I\u2019m probably in the red (even before this).\n\nHowever, all these Tweets exposing founders and criticizing things like \u201cimagined value\u201d of coins, got me thinking about metaverse projects the most. Biggest projects like [*Sandbox*](https://www.sandbox.game/en/) and [*Decentraland*](https://decentraland.org/) have millions of dollars poured in through users via land sales and etc, *MetaHero* has millions poured in through the co-founders themselves, and ones that haven\u2019t even IDO\u2019ed like [*Space*](https://www.tryspace.com/) have millions invested through tier 1 VC\u2019s. No one on my personal social media or even crypto Twitter has posted gameplay in it, and apparently Decentraland has less than 3000 active users.\n\nI tried to dismiss \u201cimagined value\u201d criticisms (denial) but this kind of makes me think negatively.\n\nI\u2019m guessing people who are putting money into these projects are doing it for \\*long\\* term investment and using those big numbers for the headline, but  maybe I\u2019m still in denial. If anyone could tell me, it would help a lot for my future \u201cinvestments.\u201d",
