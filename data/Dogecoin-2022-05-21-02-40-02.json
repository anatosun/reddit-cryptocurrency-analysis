It\u2019s kinda like entering a levered position midway through & trying to take profit during a bull that sets new all time highs every week. Good luck pulling the trigger & good luck winning the lotto but most likely you\u2019ll look at your phone and it\u2019s trading at 10-15 cents & you\u2019ll panic back in for it to correct back to less than a dime and at that moment you\u2019re gonna be playing musical chairs before you even realize what hit you. Ask Gabe over @ Melvin Capital how that worked out? Answer is not very well to say the least, and let me tell ya his hands are as diamond as they come. Nobody is immune.
