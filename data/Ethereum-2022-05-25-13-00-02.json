            "selftext": "I'm interested because, as we went to cryptocurrency acceptance, everything sprang out at once, crypto, metaverse, and the entire issue is there in talks, the press, and on television.  \n\n\nWhich cryptocurrency caught your curiosity the most at first?  \n\n\nWhen ETH was not worth much a few years ago, I didn't anticipate anything extraordinary to happen, and it all happened unexpectedly. I'm pleased I made such a radical change in my life and began doing more study on cryptocurrency.  \n\n\nI remember, that because I didn't know anyone who was working with Ethereum at the time, I was on my own and couldn't receive any solid advice. I now use Metis thanks to various Reddit users who assisted me much by exposing me to L2 platforms, and I must state that these L2 solutions are crucial for dealing with petrol prices.  \n\n\nWhat did you find most confusing at the time?  \n\n\nMany of us work with cryptocurrencies and devote significant attention to them. How are you dealing with the recent dips, are you concerned, and have you considered selling crypto?",

Inexperience and greed unfortunately leaves me in the red at the moment but my mentality has changed since then. Personally i feel freedom and independence being \"my own bank\" and regardless of the dollar value it gives me great pleasure to know a large portion of my money is not being held and used by banks to support drilling, fracking, war, and lobbying politicians into creating policies with which I disagree. Happy to be part of this new frontier and will continue to move what fiat I can into projects I believe in. Not planning on selling unless I can't put food on the table.",
