I'm pleased I made such a radical change in my life and began doing more study on cryptocurrency.  \n\n\nI remember, that because I didn't know anyone who was working with Ethereum at the time, I was on my own and couldn't receive any solid advice. I now use Metis thanks to various Reddit users who assisted me much by exposing me to L2 platforms, and I must state that these L2 solutions are crucial for dealing with petrol prices.  \n\n\nWhat did you find most confusing at the time?  \n\n\nMany of us work with cryptocurrencies and devote significant attention to them. How are you dealing with the recent dips, are you concerned, and have you considered selling crypto?",
