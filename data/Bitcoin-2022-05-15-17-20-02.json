And the keys are derived from the wallet\u2019s recovery seed, which users are encouraged to store by writing on paper or stamping into metal plates. \n\nAn EMP isn\u2019t going to corrupt a piece of paper or a metal plate.\n\nYou can throw your Ledger into a volcano and it won\u2019t matter. You just import the recovery seed into a new wallet. \n\nMore info: https://bitcoinbriefly.com/ultimate-guide-to-bitcoin-wallets-seeds-private-keys-public-keys-and-addresses/",
