It's not even a drop in the bucket.  It's the same as burning a $50 bill if you have 1 million dollars.  So, if burning 50 billion out of that many is a major milestone...  yikes.\n\nIf you're going to buy alts, it's important to understand some basic math.  The more of a coin they mint, the less scarce the coin becomes...  because there's more of them.  That isn't the only thing that gives a coin value, but it plays an important role.\n\nAlways look at the current supply and the max supply before buying a coin you intend to hold.",
