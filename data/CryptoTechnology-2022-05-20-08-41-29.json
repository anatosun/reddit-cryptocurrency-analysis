I just think that it kinda sucks that all of this capital is being funneled towards hyper-inflated JPEGs that won\u2019t end up contributing in providing any needed use cases.\n\nInstead, I think that more resources should be allocated towards exploring the multiple use cases that NFTs have to offer from legal work, to protecting against brand counterfeit to even music and concerts. And we\u2019re starting to actually see some progress in that regard with some projects like Tune. fm using NFTs to their advantage for streaming as part of hbar foundation\u2019s $250 million metaverse development fund which I think will push a lot of other chains to start doing encouraging NFT projects to discover the utilitarian side of NFTs.\n\nNFT art will stay as an important part of the crypto culture, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t explore new opportunities that NFT technology has to offer",

However, unlike transactions(which are onchain data as well) their utility is not contained and enforced within the system. Whatever you put in an NFT needs an external party to enforce it. Proof you own some digital peace of information is only proof if there is some external party, which accepts this as proof.\n\nYou can own any music in an NFT, but people can freely copy digital info without your knowledge, it is only if a court or some other external institution recognizes your NFT as proof that you will be able to enforce your ownership.\n\nNow you could argue that in the future this will happen but then again, it will be centralized and how will it be different from existing copyright claims, patents and licences? Those recods/documents/proofs are now stored in central databases and enforced by law/issuer, etc..\n\nThe only thing that an NFT can add to this is the fact the central party cant falsify/take back/change the information. But since both systems heavily rely on the same central party it makes no sense to not trust it.",

Now when I apply for a job, the employer csn verify the validity of my degree.\n\nSo the NFT is ONLY useful, if and only if my employer takes the NFT as proof, AND if he trusts the public key that issued the NFT belongs to the Univeristy.\n\nSo were back to square one, the NFT is usless unless central parties agree to accept it as proof. \nHow is this different or better then showing a signed degree from the University, which is common. Or how would that be better then a gov. Wide central repository of all degrees. The only added value is its immutable. But that would mean the University would have to change my diploma? Your truasting the University to sign NFTs with their public key anyway, why not trust them to not take your degree away from you?\n\n\nGame items are the same, as long as the code in the game reads NFT data and gives you the items its fine, but your onchain items are usless if the same developers simply change the code and the game does not recognize your NFTs anymore. You dont solve the single point of failure as all solutions rely on a central party at some point.",

The blog is an attempt to paint a picture of a decentralized internet in which users are in control of their data. I read a tonne of papers about blockchain enabled digital identiy and while there is potencial for it, its not realy something you want to do with NFTs.\n\nPeople forget that in order to habe an immutable lesger, we must have verifiability of its entire history. By having your ID in NFTs it inherently means your ID is public, for everyone, for ever. You wouldnt be in control of it, you cant alter it or delete it. \n\nThe actual implementation should be something in the lines of ZKP and maybe, in the future, once its feasibly to do, hommomorphic encryption.\n\nSimplistic solution:\nID data is onchain, and ecrypted, a web3 enabled service requests access to part of your ID, if you agree, you give access by decrypting with your pvt key and encrypting back with the sites public key.\n\nProblem: We can do this offchain, but lets keep the onchain data for verifiability. The bigger problem is once site A gets your data, you loose control over it as it again, can be copied, distributed and used without your consent as it is nowdays.\n\nBetter solution:\nInstead of giving site A your data, have site A ask a question such as, is this user from and EU country and is he/she older then 18? Diliver a ZKP, prooving that this is true without revealing the data, have verifiability onchain.\n\nNot sure about how NFTs come into this but I honestly have not done any research on it. It could be useful but for public data. I suppose there is added value if you can see what everyone on the internet knows about you as opposed to centralized  services that store, and monetize your data without your consent/knowledge. But its still does not solve the privacy issue.",
