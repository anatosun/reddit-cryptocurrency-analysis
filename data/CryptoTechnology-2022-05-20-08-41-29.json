I just think that it kinda sucks that all of this capital is being funneled towards hyper-inflated JPEGs that won\u2019t end up contributing in providing any needed use cases.\n\nInstead, I think that more resources should be allocated towards exploring the multiple use cases that NFTs have to offer from legal work, to protecting against brand counterfeit to even music and concerts. And we\u2019re starting to actually see some progress in that regard with some projects like Tune. fm using NFTs to their advantage for streaming as part of hbar foundation\u2019s $250 million metaverse development fund which I think will push a lot of other chains to start doing encouraging NFT projects to discover the utilitarian side of NFTs.\n\nNFT art will stay as an important part of the crypto culture, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t explore new opportunities that NFT technology has to offer",

As opposed to storage on the blockchain, which would be decentralized.  With smart contracts adding value.  Also, there's tons of stuff that ISN'T on ANY sort of database.  Haven't you ever seen on one of those pawn shows where someone brings in an item, and either they don't have any proof of authenticity, or the proof of authenticity is just a piece of paper that's easily lost or destroyed?  Nobody's going to set up and manage a database for decades or centuries for a limited-run production of niche items, but ownership records for things like that could exist on the public blockchain indefinitely.\n\n> The only thing that an NFT can add to this is the fact the central party cant falsify/take back/change the information.\n\n1) Nope, that's not the only thing they offer.  One example is a secondary video games market, where people can sell their licenses.  The original developer could put all sorts of smart contracts in the system.  Each sale of a license could send a cut to the original developer.  Another idea is concert tickets.  Secondary market ticket sales would be scam-proof, and smart contracts could enforce that secondary be no higher than MSRP, which would solve the speculative/bot buying problem in one fell swoop.  If you don't see the value in replacing TicketMaster (and their ridiculous fees), I don't know what to tell you.\n\n2) An NFT solution doesn't need to be absolutely game-changing to make sense.  It just needs to be better than existing solutions.  And in basically every case, NFT solutions are at least notably better.",

If any system is ever ripe for replacing with cryptographic proves secured on a public ledger and witnessed by thousands of nodes distributed around the world , it's paper signatures. \n\nI like your other comment about the privacy concerns and the need to use zero knowledge proofs for anything related to ID, but that's in the distant future, the tech isn't ready yet to make this safely possible. Anyone who promotes blockchains for digital ID and voting currently is a dangerous charlatan, these people need to be called out and ignored. What I see the mainstream of the crypto industry currenty excited about and working on is stuff like gaming and music, and those work great with what we have already. \n\nNFT has become a buzzword, the general public probably thinks it means colorful pictures while some crypto bros might think anything will have an NFT in the future. But in reality this is just what smart people have foreseen years ago. We're finally getting real adoption and something like ticketing for example works great as an NFT. Because practically every young person who visits a concert or festival buys their ticket online these days anyway. It's already digital but then for legacy reasons they often still mail a paper ticket, which is idiotic on so many levels. Just think of the emissions trucks cause driving these pieces of paper around for no good reason. But for the issuer there are more advantages. They can finally at least monitor the resale market (aka scalping, which is a massive problem for the industry). And they can react to their findings and adjust the fee for reselling in the future as they see fit. This does not affect the honest concert goer as they don't intend to resell. It might actually lead to cheaper prices for the audience as well as increased profits for the promoters/venues, because now the middle men have been taken out of the picture. Someone buying fake tickets on craigslist or off some shady guy in a back alley will also be a thing of the past. \n\nThis is just one example, I honestly find it fascinating how underrated and misunderstood all these use cases are even within the crypto community itself. This is the adoption everyone's been waiting for and it's coming for real this time, there are dozens of billion dollar companies already involved and some of the products are already live, even if not quite mass market ready yet.",

I could go into an hours long rant about this and explain why but the TLDR is that universities don't have their (computer) security act together, so they can't be trusted with putting this up online. What they currently do is require you to email to verify, at least the ones I know of. Some might not even offer that, then you would be stuck calling or sending paper mail. \n\nIf you wanted the certificates online, a private company could do it for them. Which I guess is fine in theory, I just think that it's likely most are going to use a public permissionless ledger because that's how these things usually go. Students would have concerns. And they simply don't want anything from private enterprises, same reason they favor open source software over commercial solutions, even in cases where the open source isn't that good. \n\nYou'd also have the issue of compatibility of different private solutions. The key advantage of putting it on the chain is that anyone can check it from anywhere in the world. It doesn't cost anything to maintain and the cost of putting the information up will be a lot lower than printing those shitty certificates with their seal or whatever \"security\" feature they have. We live in a globalized world where millions of people work in foreign countries but employees still have to request notarized copies or email the universities if they want to authenticate a degree. I have person experience with this, it's a big issue in some industries and regions, fake degrees are more common than you might think for the very reason that employees can't easily check. When they're on chain, it could be a formality, it could be done in an automated way when you apply and no human would ever have to even look at it unless they wanted to. It's not the same with a random digital signature that a guy from let's say Japan where they might use a different system from your country doesn't know how to trust. There will be blockchain services that abstract the complexity away, if even needed - like in the case of a multichain future. With smart contracts you can do that.",

I get your point. So if all 200 countries implemented this and it were easy to use for anyone around the world, a blockchain wouldn't be needed at all. I highly doubt that's going to happen though. In reality you'll have some universities onboard and then others and then more and more. And in the end all of them will be on chain. The other way would require lots of political will and coordination. Blockchains are the path of least resistance for this problem, even though they're not strictly needed on a technical level like you say. I think in this case it's the established global and permissionless network that makes the difference. I'm sure most IT departments in universities will also run their own nodes in the future, at least for the preferred chain the university uses itself.",

Creating a standard is not as hard as getting everyone to use it. But then again, the NFT based degree is just another standard employers need to adopt? All universities and governments need to start putting it onchain and then ship a software soltuion for employers to use for verification. Sounds a lot like the same problem with the exception that the NFT solution uses a decentralized 100% replicated immutable slow DB, while the other uses a super fast, sharded DB cluster with redundancy.",

The blog is an attempt to paint a picture of a decentralized internet in which users are in control of their data. I read a tonne of papers about blockchain enabled digital identiy and while there is potencial for it, its not realy something you want to do with NFTs.\n\nPeople forget that in order to habe an immutable lesger, we must have verifiability of its entire history. By having your ID in NFTs it inherently means your ID is public, for everyone, for ever. You wouldnt be in control of it, you cant alter it or delete it. \n\nThe actual implementation should be something in the lines of ZKP and maybe, in the future, once its feasibly to do, hommomorphic encryption.\n\nSimplistic solution:\nID data is onchain, and ecrypted, a web3 enabled service requests access to part of your ID, if you agree, you give access by decrypting with your pvt key and encrypting back with the sites public key.\n\nProblem: We can do this offchain, but lets keep the onchain data for verifiability. The bigger problem is once site A gets your data, you loose control over it as it again, can be copied, distributed and used without your consent as it is nowdays.\n\nBetter solution:\nInstead of giving site A your data, have site A ask a question such as, is this user from and EU country and is he/she older then 18? Diliver a ZKP, prooving that this is true without revealing the data, have verifiability onchain.\n\nNot sure about how NFTs come into this but I honestly have not done any research on it. It could be useful but for public data. I suppose there is added value if you can see what everyone on the internet knows about you as opposed to centralized  services that store, and monetize your data without your consent/knowledge. But its still does not solve the privacy issue.",

It's a nice idea *on paper* but the Internet literally cannot support the amount of data throughput that would be necessary for transfer of information stored on block chain to be useful, and it won't be able to anytime soon.\n\nAdditionally, as long as the community is swamped with people hoping to get rich by passing on their NFTs to the next sucker in line, it will be impossible for reasonable, non-scam projects to make headway. So, all you have to do to see a future of good NFT implementation is solve *greed* permanently - and then find a use case for NFTs that cannot be addressed more easily with not-NFTs.",
