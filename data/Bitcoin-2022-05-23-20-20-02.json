I dont know what the fair value is, you dont either, and we're all just riding till we're bored. Im not saying I have the answer, but I have a braingasm I'd like to analyze in further detail. And before you say anything, I dont think the stock-to-flow model is valid for reasons i can discuss if asked.\n\nI'm currently working on a thought experiment to determine BTCs fair value. Unlike many assets that appreciate in value with increased volatility or at least require an increased risk premium for it, I theorize the volatility of BTC is inversely correlated with its potential valuation. Specifically, bitcoins fair value will be reached not when it reaches a specific price, but when its volatility begins to mimic that of other store of value assets (ex: gold). My reason for this is simple. I dont think people purchase assets such as gold simply because it retains its value. I believe its because they retain their value with very little volatility in between.\n\nI believe in its current state, as a highly volatile asset, bitcoin has no purpose. It is more in line with a venture capital yolo then it is a store of value. Everyone seems to think that BTC will become a store of value once it stabilizes, I however believe it will become a store of value AS it stabilizes.\n\nThis issue here is I don't really know how to backtest if this relationship holds, and if it does, apply it to to a valuation estimate. Its something that I need to do further research on. Im just curious on peoples thoughts on my original idea, what Im missing, where I can gather data, before I dig too much into this box of worms. Has something like this been analyzed",

Like why?\n\nThey're not thinking long term enough. The opportunity for financial freedom is diminishing. Gains will continue to decrease until it is just a slow upward trend making Bitcoin a superior savings vehicle.\n\nYou're right to be thankful for the sideways action.\n\nI, however, am 5 years in and have transitioned to the selling side, and at these prices I'm on one hell of a budget. I would LOVE bitcoin to moon to $100k. I'm ready.\n\nStill I'm glad people like you who see the opportunity get a better chance to accumulate. This time is much like Q1 2019, at which point many had fled the market but I was buying as much as I could afford.\n\nIt's a good time to stack. I don't think it will drop more, but if it does, stack more.",

My point is that based off of the history. No matter when you bought over this last 10+ years, you could have made money in bitcoin even if you bought at the all-time high. We obviously don\u2019t know how the future will play out in anything. But so far it doesn\u2019t matter when you bought bitcoin in terms of having gains in your portfolio. Obviously this last crash is not counted here. But everything before this has proven the exact opposite. \n\nThere\u2019s no reason for bitcoin to stop going up (for now) unless the stock market crashes, which seems to be quite possible. Other than that, it\u2019s not going to be banned, it\u2019s too big to fail.

Drop a little here and there as you pursue other things.  You will never get the gains of 1000 BTC when it was worthless because no on was HODLing then because few believed or understood.  Incrementally get what you can, but it should not be hard to hold because it should not be your whole life.   -The End.",
