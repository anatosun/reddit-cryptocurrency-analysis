I dont know what the fair value is, you dont either, and we're all just riding till we're bored. Im not saying I have the answer, but I have a braingasm I'd like to analyze in further detail. And before you say anything, I dont think the stock-to-flow model is valid for reasons i can discuss if asked.\n\nI'm currently working on a thought experiment to determine BTCs fair value. Unlike many assets that appreciate in value with increased volatility or at least require an increased risk premium for it, I theorize the volatility of BTC is inversely correlated with its potential valuation. Specifically, bitcoins fair value will be reached not when it reaches a specific price, but when its volatility begins to mimic that of other store of value assets (ex: gold). My reason for this is simple. I dont think people purchase assets such as gold simply because it retains its value. I believe its because they retain their value with very little volatility in between.\n\nI believe in its current state, as a highly volatile asset, bitcoin has no purpose. It is more in line with a venture capital yolo then it is a store of value. Everyone seems to think that BTC will become a store of value once it stabilizes, I however believe it will become a store of value AS it stabilizes.\n\nThis issue here is I don't really know how to backtest if this relationship holds, and if it does, apply it to to a valuation estimate. Its something that I need to do further research on. Im just curious on peoples thoughts on my original idea, what Im missing, where I can gather data, before I dig too much into this box of worms. Has something like this been analyzed",
