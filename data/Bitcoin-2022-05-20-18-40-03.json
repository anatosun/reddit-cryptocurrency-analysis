Bitcoin's price continues to grow at a very rapid rate, long term average.  You see, there were good reasons for Bitcoin's rapid rise.  Most of those reasons still exist.  In fact, today there are even more good reasons than there were 10 or 5 years ago.  It is reasonable to expect the long term average growth rate of Bitcoin to stay very high for the foreseeable future.  \n\nReal estate has significant holding costs (eg: taxes, maintenance, insurance, sometimes fees, interest).  Real estate isn't very liquid, and it has extremely high transaction costs.  \n\nUltimately, the price of real estate (and rents) is limited by incomes.  For example, in the long run people can't pay more for mort./rent than they earn.  Realistically, they might be able to afford 35 or 40 percent of their net income for \"a place to live\".  Thus, real estate prices are limited by incomes, in the long run.  Incomes tend to barely keep up with inflation.  \n\nLooking at long term historical data, such as Case-Shiller, for popular real estate markets, we see, in fact, that real estate prices barely track the rate of inflation, especially when the significant holding costs are properly accounted for.  \n\nBitcoin has no such limit.  Bitcoin has no holding costs.  Bitcoin is liquid.  Bitcoin transactions are typically very little.  Bitcoin's price has been more than doubling every year, long term average, and as mentioned before, can reasonably be expected to continues its rapid ascent.  \n\nReal estate is currently in a bubble, as evidenced by the price-to-income ratios.  The current bubble will pop, as the prior bubble eventually had to pop.  \n\nReal estate is nailed down.  Bitcoin can be taken with you to anywhere in the world.  Real estate is a sitting duck for higher taxes.  Real estate can be confiscated.  \n\nWhen the private keys are properly stored, Bitcoin cannot be confiscated.  \n\nKnowing all this, a person would be a total idiot to purchase real estate instead of investing in Bitcoin.  \n\nHaving said that, I do plan on eventually using a small fraction (about 10 or 15 percent) of my Bitcoin holdings to buy my dream home - and to pay for it with Bitcoin, but still end up sitting on a serious stack of sats.  \n\nI have zero regrets for investing in Bitcoin instead of real estate, and I never will.",

Even when markets are high it can takes months to sell a house. I think 500-1000$ a month is great to get into Bitcoin. You will learn the patterns and odds are btc will cross 100k in the next bull run following the 2024 halving. If you can stack 1-2 btc your looking at 100-200k off of investing 10-40k depending on what Bitcoin prices are in the current bear market. We might see sub 20k prices soon.",

Real estate prices are at its peak while btc price is down more than 50% from top. \n\nMaybe try buying as much BTC, but allocating at least 3.5% for a down payment (FHA loan) would be a good idea. So figuring out your monthly mortgage and living cost would be crucial.\n\nIn order to create a balanced wealth portfolio, you have to have BTC and a house that builds equity and eliminate paying rent. What's great about about both BTC and real estate is that you can borrow against those assets to buy even more assets. You can borrow against BTC instantly, but real estate may take a while for the price to rise to be able to borrow against equity.\n\nOnce you figure that out, the you can DCA into btc and other assets however and how often you like.\n\nBTC and real estate prices can only go up in the long term view because of inflation. Scarce assets vs infinite supply of $.",

Easier financing down payment, interest and qualification. Live there and get whatever work down it needs. Immediately save a down payment for a larger house. This should be easier since you bought less house than you could afford for the first one. The goal was something that would make a good rental, not your dream home. Now, buy the next one. Something a little better, not your dream probably. The bank only requires you live in a place one year(many people get away with less) if you are getting owner occupied financing. So now you can get the next one. You can have the original rented and count 75% of the rent towards your income. \n\nThis is the easiest way to build a portfolio of  properties. Just so much easier to qualify for owner occ loans. And cheaper. \n\nThis is the slowest way to get the house you really want to live in  lol!",

So if you buy a non single family home you can rent the others right away. After the first year you can rent out your unit.\n\nHave a friend who just had an offer on a 3 unit accepted this way. With the 2 currently rented units it will cover all expenses and cashflow a small amount the way it sits. When he moves out next year he will have saved another down payment and increase his income tremendously by renting out his old unit.\n\nI'm a big fan of using the owner occupy to build portfolio and a portfolio that churns out income can buy a boatload of bitcoin!",

But yeah talking advantage of the primary residence rules is the easist and lowest cost way for a young guy to start out. Honestly for me, it was probably the only way. Anyone willing to delay the gratification of having a large house and is willing to 1. not use all of their available credit and 2. Focus on properties in desirable areas that will make great rentals can do it. Eventually you can get that bigger house you want. When you do, tenants from the other properties will pay the mortgage for you.",

That's why every joe schmoe boomer stumbled into decent returns on their housing units that they bought when then were younger. Here's good source on this : https://realestatedecoded.com/real-monthly-mortgage-payment-home-price-index/\n\nWith interest rates at near zero, you won't have the same opportunity unless the Fed decides to go Volcker and raise rates to 20%. If that happens, that would be an ok time to buy real estate but it probably won't happen. Now is a terrible time to buy real estate and expect the same return that your boomer parents got over the years. At best, you'll be breaking even minus depreciation costs because the interest rate cannot go much lower than zero.\n\nWith Bitcoin, you have an emerging store of value that works. Most people probably think its a scam and are extremely misinformed regarding its value proposition. You can see this every time some news regarding bitcoin reaches the frontpage of reddit. Since you are on this subreddit, you likely have a tremendous advantage over other people because you have an accurate knowledge of what Bitcoin can do. That's called an edge, in investing/trading terms. Without edge, you won't get above average returns. When you buy real estate, unless you are a real estate professional that understands the local market extremely well, you have no edge and the fed isn't going to help you.\n\nSo if you understand Bitcoin better than the average normie and you understand the importance of interest rates, the only reason you'd buy real estate is because you need some place to live. As an investment, Bitcoin is going to kick real estate's ass for the next 10 years, same as it has done the last 10 years.",

Younger people can typically assume more risk because they have time on their side. There are 100% no guarantees that bitcoin is around in 30 years. There could be another crypto that comes along and takes over, there could be more countries that ban it, it could be vulnerable to some sort of hack that is yet to be discovered, quantum computing could change things, the list goes on.\n\nAs I mentioned above about risk, usually I would say real estate is more of a lower risk over time. You could buy during a bubble and wait it out and probably be fine. So for most, real estate is safe.\n\nI would say that everyone should have investments in many different areas. Own a home, have a 401k, perhaps get a second home as a rental, stack bitcoin and or other cryptos, save cash. Each person has they\u2019re own risk tolerance and how aggressive they want to invest\u2026low risk- low reward, high risk-high reward. Personally, I have my risk spread all over from\nLow to high. I\u2019m a big proponent of not having all your eggs in one basket. Any financial advisor will typically tell you to diversify your investments.\n\nIf your friends have other investments and it\u2019s not hurting them to dump $500/month into it they\u2019ll be fine either way. Now if they have no other investments and they\u2019re dumping all their potential savings into bitcoin then IMO I wouldn\u2019t advise it. But maybe they\u2019re young and they can afford to assume more risk and if they want to play the risk game they\u2019re more than welcome to. Basically it may or may not work out for them.",
