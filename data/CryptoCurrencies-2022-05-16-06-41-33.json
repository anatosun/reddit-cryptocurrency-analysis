When the FED does it, it's bad. When the government sends out checks bad. When people invest and lose their shirt on crypto and get a bailout, good? I'm all for helping people hurt, 100% help them and make them whole. That said the crypto community is full of cognitive dissonance that wants it's cake (be my own bank and freedom) and eat it too (when I get wrecked someone please help!).",
