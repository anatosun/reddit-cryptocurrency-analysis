There's a 100% certainty that the USD will continue to be devalued.\n\nLet's look at Bitcoin's long term average ROI.\n\nFive years ago, the price was $2018.  Today it's about $30,000.  That works out to about 72% per year, compounded for five years.\n\nTen years ago, the price was about $6.  That works out to 134% per year, compounded for ten years in a row.

At that point bitcoin will be easily valued at several hundred thousand dollars.  That will be more than a tripling.  Given the amount of risk involved in bitcoin it's still a buy.\n\nSend me a DM.",
