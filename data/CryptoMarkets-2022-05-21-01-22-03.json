Something that we can\u2019t know because their balance sheet isn\u2019t transparent. So we just get to take their word for it, but people still storing their life savings on that greedy Chinese Hong Kong trash in a cold wallet somewhere & won\u2019t be able to move quick enough if it looses its peg, & then they\u2019re gonna get pegged by their wife before she ultimately takes the kids and leave their sorry ass",

I\u2019m sure they have some pretty snazzy accountants that can make shit look good & let\u2019s say they are being fully transparent & we take the audit report at face value. Well then now the majority of their asset value from the auditors report says that a small minority, 10% of their holding\u2019s is backed by USD & other fiat cash and majority was in junk bonds until recent and apparently now it\u2019s going to T bonds which is much more intelligent but they better be careful because when the fear reaches peak levels and inflation is halfway better which leads to halfway stabilize stocks & they start trading sideways in the recession, Wall St is gonna dump the bonds in favor of higher yields in energy, consumer staples probably dividends as well. and defense sectors especially if Ukraine vs Russia gets worse & that fundamentally will force T bonds to plunge then they\u2019re gonna be back In the same game of musical chairs smh \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f You don\u2019t peg shit to the dollar & then back it with < 10% dollar. You\u2019re telling the blind the sky is red and they don\u2019t know any better. it\u2019s fucked up man, I\u2019m no economic genius just a high school drop out but if I wanted t bond stability I would just buy them, and not rely on a stable going that is backed by worldclass traders.
