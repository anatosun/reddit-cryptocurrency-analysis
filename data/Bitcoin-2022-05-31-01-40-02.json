We are nowhere near a a demand spiral in USD resulting in a depression. This can happen but will more than likely take decades to unfold or global war. Even an interim deflationary period will be unlikely to spiral into a near term depression. The housing market spike is not correlated to falling usd demand pressures. It\u2019s a combination of inflation driven asset valuations mixed with a historically thin supply shock. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I see your bigger picture, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on it manifesting anytime soon.",

Inflation likely continue for that 1 million then will be worth maybe want $600,000 today.  So might be worth enough for a middle class House and that is assuming that it does a 30X by 2030 which is lofty.  You probably need 5 or 10 an tbh.",
