Eventually as the market gets bigger even billionaires and institutions won\u2019t be able to budge the price and only central banks and governments will.

But thats kinda the point. Bitcoin can be so many things in the future thats why its a highly speculative asset as of now, and just because the market does something does not mean its smart or saying much. Just as if you buy gold, you probably dont care where its in a month you care that it goes up long term right?",

If inflation drops too low then miners will experience a pay cut and lose interest.

Eventually these cuts will sting and create a lot of infighting and tension.",

If anything, due to fed tightening, usd is getting stronger (google dxy) so makes sense that we'd see the rally before, and the pullback now. If you believe fed tightening will successfully stop inflation whilst upholding us economy, don't buy bitcoin now.",
