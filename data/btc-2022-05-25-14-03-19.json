(hint they don't care about self custody)\n\n\n* Your 'users' see this and quite naturally want to increase their own wealth, of which the vast majority don't care about self custody either.\n\n\nThat should be easy enough to understand even for those that think you can scale in layers when the base layer capacity (that higher layers depend upon) is highly constrained, **how useful would the Internet be if backbone routers were limited to 3 packets per second and a $1 toll.**\n\n\n\n> If BTC will not work with 1MB blocks, majority of users and miners will vote to increase the limit (Like Satoshi intended). \n\n\nBig Money in the space doesn't care about high fees, they can afford them.\n\n\n**Whether you can afford to transact on the main chain will not be about how much 'BTC' you have but more about how much the people above you have.** BTC was put in quotes because of course the people on the bottom will only have IOU's. and the joke is - *that might be you*. heh heh!\n\n\nNow what do these Big Money interests need and want? \n\n\n**Extremely hard money - The harder it is to change the better**, as pointed out earlier fees and hence blocksize will not affect them as, either they can afford the fees, or a custodial solution is required for their compliance.\n\n\nBut you think principled 'users' and 'miners' are going to rebel and turn down the 'numbers go up' offered by the Big Money 1MB (non witness) chain, don't make me laugh, the principled people who were capable of understanding what a 1MB (non witness) cap would do to Bitcoin have already left or at the very least diversified.\n\n\nHere's the thoughts of one of BTC's main drivers (in terms of capital inflow) \n\n\n>> **Michael Saylor:** why you know if you if you read the block size wars a lot of manoeuvring back and forth but at the end of the day the immediate a priori observation is they shouldn't have tried to change anything **it was a mistake to try to change the block size**...

I do not.  I think if you expect to move 1000X or more volume, you're gonna need 1000X more fees.  Why not?\n\n> Actually you are a gaslighter promoting BCH in a BTC sub.\n\nThis is the uncensored Bitcoin sub.  This sub exists to allow discussion of all topics related to Bitcoin.  This is not a \"BCH\" sub.  You're allowed to hang out here all you like (as long as you're not aggressive or harrassing) and share your views until the end of time. \n\nThe fact that this sub is populated mostly by big-block Bitcoiners should make you ask, where are all the small-blockers and why don't they come here?  If BTC really is 100X more popular like you guys claim, it would be trivial to overwhelm the uncensored sub with BTC posts.\n\n> Telling me that Blockstream is controlling all the BTC mining power\n\nYou completely made that up.  I never said anything of the sort.\n\n> and there will never be a fair voting for a good hard fork.\n\nThat's my opinion, you're allowed to believe otherwise.   I'd love to see it tried though!!\n\n>  And they are steering Bitcoin to abyss and BTC is 100% going to fail.\n\nAgain, that's my opinion, not gaslighting.  \n\nYou might be right.  BTC already did a complete 180 on its mission once, maybe it can do another one.  Either way I could never recommend in good faith a project whose mission has become \"own the cashies\".",
