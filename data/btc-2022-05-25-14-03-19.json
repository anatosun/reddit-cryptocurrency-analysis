I do not.  I think if you expect to move 1000X or more volume, you're gonna need 1000X more fees.  Why not?\n\n> Actually you are a gaslighter promoting BCH in a BTC sub.\n\nThis is the uncensored Bitcoin sub.  This sub exists to allow discussion of all topics related to Bitcoin.  This is not a \"BCH\" sub.  You're allowed to hang out here all you like (as long as you're not aggressive or harrassing) and share your views until the end of time. \n\nThe fact that this sub is populated mostly by big-block Bitcoiners should make you ask, where are all the small-blockers and why don't they come here?  If BTC really is 100X more popular like you guys claim, it would be trivial to overwhelm the uncensored sub with BTC posts.\n\n> Telling me that Blockstream is controlling all the BTC mining power\n\nYou completely made that up.  I never said anything of the sort.\n\n> and there will never be a fair voting for a good hard fork.\n\nThat's my opinion, you're allowed to believe otherwise.   I'd love to see it tried though!!\n\n>  And they are steering Bitcoin to abyss and BTC is 100% going to fail.\n\nAgain, that's my opinion, not gaslighting.  \n\nYou might be right.  BTC already did a complete 180 on its mission once, maybe it can do another one.  Either way I could never recommend in good faith a project whose mission has become \"own the cashies\".",
