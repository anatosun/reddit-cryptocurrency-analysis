Like I've been trying to talk with bitcoiners and I feel like I get no straight answers. I'm not a crypto expert and I'm not interested in investing for a bunch of reasons but I'm still fascinated. And for me it's simple: \n\nBitcoin l1 is limited by 867 000 transcations a day. If billions of people would want to use it a single transcation per person would take decades. Even with l2 handling all transcations back and forth people have to interact with the base layer at some point, right? If not they never own any bitcoins and it would be so centralized there's no point at all. Not to speak of the security risks since lightning is not secured by the base layer.\n\nAm I missing something? I know many of you chose BCH or whatever for a reason and it's probably this. But like everytime I try to get an answer from a bitcoiner I feel like I don't get any and it's just \"lightning network solves it\" and then I don't get any further. From a theoretical standpoint, is it even possible to scale to billions while being decentralised and people actually owning the bitcoins?",

Which, as a rough thought experiment, helps you realize that at scale, the BTC blockchain will only ever be accessible to the world's most powerful financial institutions.

The difference is, BTC can and in fact should be clogged up to generate higher fees. That is the gameplan of the devs to generate BTC security. \n\nBTC 0-conf is not save for multiple reasons. \n\n- First seen rule is not a rule on the BTC chain. \n- Your chance to get in the next block is small so the time to double spend is actually much longer. No RBF needed\n- BTC doesn't have double spend proof with further increases the safety of 0-conf on BCH. \n\nThe fact that you do not encounter payment opportunities in normal life is that BTC derailed adoption when it hit the blocksize limit in 2017 and fees skyrocket. Adoption came to a halt many companies even stopped accepting BTC and the narrativ changed from p2p cash to store of value. \n\nBCH is basically starting from scratch.",

No other coin is as loved by its supporters (to persist through so much adversity) or **as hated by its detractors (who fear it as a threat, either to their investment in Bitcoin BTC or to existing government currency systems)**. No other coin, including Bitcoin BTC, has been attacked and decried to the extent that Bitcoin Cash has. Both the fervent passion of its haters to destroy it and its community to protect it are indicators that Bitcoin Cash is a true paradigm shift in the status quo. Also, the Streisand effect generated by its detractors ensures it remains uniquely notorious among a sea of other interchangeable cryptocurrencies.",

This technique was called asicboost and would have not go unnoticed when segwit activates. \n\nThis is why bitmain blocked segwit activation many years long for flimsy reasons, created and funded bitcoin abc as the \"anti segwit\" movement client to prolong the time they could use their asciboos advantage over the competition.\n\nHowever, after a few years of infighting between miners, bitcoin node operators had enough and united to set a date from which on their nodes will accept segwit blocks. this was called the UASF movement. As the date approached opposing miners got wet feet and everyone switched to segwit. With segwit asicboost usage is evident in the block header, everybody does it openly so there is no unfair advantage for a miner brand anymore. \n\nAs for BCH: bitmain pulled off the fork just in case, they kept financing bitcoin ABC for 2 more years I believe,  mined at a loss and did not sell any bch until they piled up \\~2 millions of them. They lost a buttload of money on that stunt, a big fight between bitmain owners happened, company was broken up into 2 parts. They stopped funding bitcoin abc which lead to bitcoin abc needing new income streams which lead to more infights an bitcoin abc fnally forking away from bch. What happened to the 2 million BCH bitmain owned nobody knows. some say they were sold over time, some say they went to Jihan Wu when bitmain was split in two because he was the one pushing for bch at bitmain.",

You and the author of that book appear to have been bamboozled.  I would treat that book as highly suspect, despite its supposed popularity.\n\nI was going to write this, but [someone much smarter than me](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/upcxva/whats_about_the_asicboost_and_the_fork_btc_core/i8k2s8z/) beat me to it, so I'll just quote them:\n\n> Asicboost is not incompatible with segwit and is used on the BTC chain. Only some hypothetical covert ASICboost is incompatible. That may be even in theory profitable but probably isn't.\n>\n> ASICboost is so much a game changer that it just took a bit over a year from someone discovering how to do this on existing hardware with a small software patch until someone actually used it in production. If it really saves millions of dollars for a miner, why didn't they use it as soon as it was discovered?\n>\n> I doubt that covert ASICboost can be profitable. It computes ten thousands of hashes on FPGAs to save a few millijoules on the ASIC hardware.",

Suppose it looks Like a prepaid card for rice, petrol, transport, service minutes, or anything else that is highly divisible and people want to buy widely various amounts of. They could pay fiat to top it up, but even knowing that what it's being topped up with is BCH. This would work fine, excellent use case, but the developer of the app can invent his own units- the flour app: grams of flour, the petrol app: centiliters of petrol, the transport app: to it up with 50km, the service app: minutes of lawyer time, etc.\n\nIf this one app (wallet) can do it then anyone can. \n\nEven make a traditional looking wallet but call the mbch \"skittles\" and display them in a big pile on the screen. Drag a clump to the top of the screen to spend. (For people afraid of crypto.)",

An address or some mechanism would vote upon the ISSUANCE of new coins and most new coins would return to users.  When the peg broke, and it absolutely will, the issuance is slowed.  When the peg was over a dollar the address or miners or whatever would increase the issuance.  \n\nTHIS IS WHAT IS NEEDED!  All algorithmic stable coins are fundamentally flawed and will break if a big enough player decides to break them.  A stable striving coin is EXPECTED to break.  When it it's low, it's a bargain and you know you're going to get the new issuance in proportion to the percentage you hold.  \n\nThis needs to be done.  \n\n/u/memorydealers",

This means that ZEC, by default, is not \"anonymous\", and certainly not private. ZEC's shielded system has very low adoption when compared to its transparent counterpart, and most definitely way less adoption than other privacy coins like Monero.\n\nOn top of this, currently ZEC's zero-knowledge proof cryptography relies on a trusted setup (though this is changing soon in their next upgrade I think).\n\nThen, on top of THAT, the coin itself is controlled by a registered, legal company, and not some decentralized organization/group whose members are anonymous (or, if they choose to, doxxed). This is a huge red flag, especially when zooko himself advocated for making ZEC [\"too traceable for criminals\"](https://twitter.com/zooko/status/863202798883577856), completely destroying any fungibility despite what his tweet claims. He is essentially advocating for a backdoor into shielded transactions on the network. And who defines what a \"criminal\" is, and to what degree? That's right, you're \"good friend\" the government.\n\nAnd then there's the other issue that the coin has a dev tax, so zooko is raking in that sweet cash from his FBI honeypot.\n\nZEC is a fucking joke of a privacy coin.",

If you could get 1% net profit per day, 250 business days/year implies 12x/year ($1 becomes $12 if you go all-in every work-day, due to compounding). Such a return rate of 12x/year may just be possible, at least for small amounts. Binance bases the fiat trade on tether, but WebMoney uses BTC. Binance may be safer than WebMoney imho (imagine getting murdered for under $100 - that's what bank **fraud** is like...).\n\n**Edit**: I've recently discovered there's actually a law prohibiting bankers from telling the full truth (it's a gag order, but referred to as a specific regulation). When a fraudster tries a charge-back, it immediately destroys the receiver's account (permanent). If the banker explained the situation, it'd necessarily cause a retaliation against the fraudster (even if non-violent, such retaliation can then cause violence). It's an interesting feature of p2p trading.",

Especially in a major global economic downturn.\n\nXEC poses an huge risk on the holders during corrections, as all coins go down it dumps to total oblivion levels. This is not only due to it being a wee altcoin, but due to its [fraudulent characteristics](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/uczb3z/xec_is_a_full_blown_funding_scam_18_months_of/).\n\nI don't need to tell you folks how all the global economy is in shambles right now, everybody knows that, and crypto will also pay a price. If you are the cost average person, then at least get your free BCH while you still can by liquidating your XEC.\n\nGood luck.\n\nEDIT: I understand people down voted due to me mentioning to sell your crypto and hold usdt, but it could be any other better stable coin. The point is that I think we are heading to a major correction, despite the inflationary pressures there won't be a new \"moon\" anytime soon (I could also add the systemic risk that Michael Saylor loan-based pumps are doing bu I guess you agree).

                    "response": "I won't buy BTC. I will only buy Bitcoin Cash because Bitcoin Cash is the highly improved version of BTC. Anyone can verify for themselves. Just send $10 worth of BTC and $10 worth of Bitcoin Cash from your own wallet A (not an exchange) to your own wallet B (not an exchange) and see for yourself the difference. But Bitcoin Cash is more than just fast cheap and reliable, it has many unique advantages over the old tech BTC (forever stuck on 1mb). Here are the improvements from Bitcoin Cash.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Better Security** \u2013 BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. This RBF security vulnerability exists only in BTC and not Bitcoin Cash. That's why Bitcoin Cash is more secure as a payment method.\n\nHere is an example of hackers stolen $150000 worth of BTC using the RBF security vulnerability. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/14/double-spenders-scam-150000-bitcoin/\n\nIt is super easy to double spend on Bitcoin using the RBF vulnerability. Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/video-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-double-spend-btc-using-rbf/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Rapidly Growing Transactions Volume** - Bitcoin Cash has more transactions than BTC+Lightning Network combined recently. On some days, Bitcoin Cash has more than double the transactions volume of BTC. Bitcoin Cash is growing rapidly while BTC is on the decline.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Defi Smart Contracts** - Bitcoin Cash has defi smart contracts functionalities (eg. AnyHedge, Detoken, SmartBCH). SmartBCH allows Ethereum smart contracts to be deployed as a sidechain to the Bitcoin Cash network. This means as an Ethereum developer, you no longer has any friction jumping over to join the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. All of them can come over to the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem to enjoy the low transaction fees of Bitcoin Cash.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Low Fees** \u2013 One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Derivatives, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Improved Scalability** \u2013 BTC is limited to 1MB blocksize and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Supply Scarcity** \u2013 During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Improved Confirmation Times** \u2013 Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Higher Merchants Adoption** - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today. Source: https://slp.1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame\n\nWhile Bitcoin Cash adoption is growing very quickly every single day, Bitcoin is having declining adoption and if this trend continues then Bitcoin is on a dead end. Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/NotAcceptingBitcoin/top/?sort=top&t=all\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Lightning Network Problems And Vulnerabilities And Loss Funds** - Some people may claim Lightning Network will solve Bitcoin problems but it has failed to gain traction due to many problems and vulnerabilities, such as loss of funds, unreliable transactions (constantly failing), and many other vulnerabilities.\n\nSource: https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/why-does-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-fail-new-study-proves-inefficiency/\n\nSource: https://news.bitcoin.com/researchers-scathing-lightning-network-analysis-finds-flaws/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Barriers To Success** - Unfortunately, for the past 5 years, Bitcoin Cash has been constantly undermined by lies, propaganda, censorships and other malicious activities...\n\n**1a) censorships** - https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43\n\n**1b) propaganda** - https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@adambalm/in-2013-peter-todd-was-paid-off-by-a-government-intelligence-agent-to-create-rbf-create-a-propaganda-video-and-cripple-the-btc and  https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8dd5ij/why_bitcoin_cash_users_reject_the_name_bcash_so/\n\n**1c) threats and harassments** - https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/is1130/it_seems_tim_draper_is_being_misled_about_bch_and/g54x63q/\n\n**1d) DDOS attacks** - https://wakgill.github.io/deryk/bitcoin-cyber-attacks\n\n**1e) Plus a bunch of other unethical stuff** if you care to read more at https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/hgpjph/the_pitiful_state_of_bitcoin_cash_transactions/fw5qczk/\n\nAnyone who dares to promote increasing the blocksize or favorably on Bitcoin Cash, they got banned and their voices silenced in the Bitcoin or Cryptocurrency subreddit. They also get harassed and attacked by online paid trolls. All these started back in 2015 even before Bitcoin Cash existed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**\"Digital Gold\" Or \"Store Of Value\" Propaganda** - BTC is good with propaganda but this is simple economics. Something cannot be a store of value without it first be a means of exchange. Bitcoin Cash is both a store of value AND means of exchange thanks to its low fees. Bitcoin is not feasible as a means of exchange due to its high fees of around $10 (or more) per transaction.\n\n> Store of Value: To act as a store of value, money must be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved. It must be predictably usable as a medium of exchange when it is retrieved. Additionally, the value of money must remain stable over time.\n\n> Source: https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-economics/chapter/introducing-money/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Tokens** - Today, anyone can issue their own loyalty tokens or digital money on Bitcoin Cash from as low as 1 cent. It's incredibly easy and anyone can do it at https://mint.bitcoin.com/. And anyone can then buy/sell/trade their newly created tokens on https://1BCH.com/ exchange which is fully focused on Bitcoin Cash and BCH tokens.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Increased Privacy** - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Continuous Innovations** - For example, Cash Accounts allow people to send BCH to an easy to remember non-custodial alias such as MobTwo#12345. You may register your Cash Account at https://www.cashaccount.info/\n\nTogether with Reusable Payment Addresses (RPA), Cash Accounts will allow people to send BCH to your easy to remember alias with increased privacy. You can read more about RPA at https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/o1z8a1/help_me_test_the_prototype_of_electron_cash_rpa/\n\nMany more innovations on BCH not covered in this comment to avoid turning this into an encyclopedia.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Better Risk/Reward** - If BTC gains another 1 trillion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 1 trillion will give you around 128x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities. As an investor, it make sense to know the difference between price and value. Bitcoin Cash has a high value low price while BTC has low value high price.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt the moment, the old BTC has first mover advantage (eg. Friendster or MySpace or Kodak or Nokia) but that can only last them to a point. Eventually, I believe that Bitcoin Cash will overtake BTC's marketcap. Bitcoin Cash is the second opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a low price if you missed that opportunity back in 2013.",

Swaps are slower than what we're used to in POS chains since 1 confirmation is required, but there's no other way to make a crosschain DEX work. Regarding yield, the BCH pool normally has around 18% APY.

During the blocksize debate, many people including miners were in favor of increasing the blocksize capacity of the network. It was around this time that Blockstream started using...\n\n**1a) censorships** - https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43\n\n**1b) propaganda** - https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@adambalm/in-2013-peter-todd-was-paid-off-by-a-government-intelligence-agent-to-create-rbf-create-a-propaganda-video-and-cripple-the-btc and  https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8dd5ij/why_bitcoin_cash_users_reject_the_name_bcash_so/\n\n**1c) threats and harassments** - https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/is1130/it_seems_tim_draper_is_being_misled_about_bch_and/g54x63q/\n\n**1d) DDOS attacks** - https://wakgill.github.io/deryk/bitcoin-cyber-attacks\n\n**1e) Plus a bunch of other unethical stuff** if you care to read more at https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/hgpjph/the_pitiful_state_of_bitcoin_cash_transactions/fw5qczk/\n\nAnyone who dares to promote increasing the blocksize or favorably on Bitcoin Cash, they get banned and their voices silenced in the Bitcoin subreddit. They also get harassed and attacked by online paid trolls. Mind you, all these started even before the creation of Bitcoin Cash. That\u2019s why many of us ended up in this subreddit and are Bitcoin Cash supporters.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**2) Why Bitcoin Cash uses Bitcoin in the name?**\nBoth Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are forks of the original Bitcoin software and are entitled to the name. While one network forked with Segwit (Bitcoin), the other network forked with a higher blocksize capacity to be peer to peer money for the world (Bitcoin Cash).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**3) Why can\u2019t Lightning Network solve Bitcoin\u2019s problem?**\nIt has been 6 years since the Lightning Network started and if you had been fooled the last 6 years and still believe that Lightning Network is the answer, then congratulations your 7th year is coming up next. Lightning Network has plenty of problems including losing users funds and requiring users to be online 24/7 and many other problems beyond the scope of this thread. Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/k37w3w/ill_just_leave_this_here_sample_page_from_a_paper/ge13qyq/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**4) Why not use coin XYZ instead of Bitcoin Cash for cheap transactions?**\nBitcoin Cash is accepted by more than 2,651,820 merchants worldwide. Source: https://slp.1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame\n\nIf coin XYZ is as widely accepted as Bitcoin Cash, then maybe I will consider them. In some places like Australia or Slovenia or Tokyo or Antigua, you can live off Bitcoin Cash entirely without touching your fiat. Like I said, Bitcoin Cash is unstoppable peer to peer money for the world.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**5) Bitcoin is digital gold and Bitcoin Cash is money?**\nHere\u2019s the thing. Whatever Bitcoin can do, Bitcoin Cash can do better. This means Bitcoin Cash is both better money and better digital gold than Bitcoin can be. The biggest problem is that while Bitcoin has the first mover advantage, Bitcoin Cash had to rebuilt everything from scratch since August 2017. Let me assure you that rebuilding everything from scratch in just 3 years is not an easy task.\n\nThe good news is that, first mover advantage alone, as history had shown over and over again, is often not good enough. You can read up the stories of Kodak or Friendster or Nokia. If you missed the opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a low price back in 2009, that\u2019s not your fault. But now that you understood more about cryptocurrencies and you missed out on the opportunity of getting Bitcoin Cash at a low price today, then you cannot blame anyone else.\n\nBitcoin Cash is unstoppable peer to peer money for the world. Join us in making a positive impact to humanity together.",

This happened long before the creation of Bitcoin Cash. Today, r/btc users can discuss any Bitcoin-related topic without fear of moderator retaliation, while r/Bitcoin and r/CryptoCurrency are still heavily censored.\n\nOver the years /r/btc became community of historians & torchbearers, preservers of Satoshi's Bitcoin for future generations. In this place you can learn what \"Bitcoin\" means and what it truly represents.\n\nBitcoin is the currency of the Internet. A distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without the need for any central authority whatsoever.\n\nThere is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

I care about \"Bitcoin\" and the chain that most resembles it. Remember when this sub used to talk all about the fork that is now known as BCHABC ?\n\nThat fork stopped being best version of \"Bitcoin\" - so no one is really talking about that coin now.\n\nBitcoin Cash can fork and the chain with the most hashrate will be called \"Bitcoin Cash\" - and perhaps the chain that I think most resembles \"Bitcoin\" will be a minority chain and not get the name \"BCH\" but something like \"Rose by Any Other Name\".\n\nI will come to this sub and talk about Rose. This sub is about \"Bitcoin\" and the chain YOU think is \"Bitcoin\" not what the name of the chain is called.\n\nThe fork we all know as Bitcoin Cash is IMHO the \"Bitcoin\" chain - it simply doesn't have the name because it doesn't have the price (hence hashrate).\n\nTo be fair, I would rather be in r/bitcoin ... but you know the story.",

I'm not saying there will be no upgrades, but like I said I don't think there will be fundamental changes like hashing algo every 6-12 months. That is too radical and prone to attacks, like introduction of flawed hashing algo in favor of some player like a state or shadow state actor. \n\nI think any changes going into a world scale crypto will be extremely simple, and be well understood by a large group of people to not become contentious.",

However I don't understand why this all offsets the cost of mining and environmental impact of that electricity consumption? How could any POW consensus model blockchain be feasibile when there is many POS projects with also undefeated security? I can see it has some value but a 800B whatever MC is absurd when compared to the real world value some companies bring. Is BTC really worth 1/3 or 1/3of apple? I can't see any way to justify it, can someone provide me with their perspective?\n\nForgive the edgy title to get clicks",

The hashpower follows the price.\n\nBitcoin uses a difficulty algorithm that adjusts to keep the rate of block production the same. That means that Bitcoin always produces the same number of coins per day / week / month no matter how many people mine it. \n\nSo if Bitcoin is worth $1 ea and produces 6.25 coins per block and 6 blocks per hour, then it generates about $37.50 for miners every hour. Miners join to earn profit but stop joining when it's no longer profitable.  Once $37.50 worth of hashpower is being applied to mine this chain, then it's not profitable to add more. The result is that if Bitcoin is worth $1 then you can expect about $37.50 in hashpower will be used to mine it.\n\nIf Bitcoin rises to $1000 ea then each hour it generates about $37,500. So more miners will join seeking profit, and stop joining once it's no longer profitable. Eventually $37,500 in hashpower is applied and equilibrium is reached. The result is that if Bitcoin is worth $1000 then you can expect about $37,500 in hashpower will be used to mine it.\n\nSo again, hashpower follows price.",

(The direction of causuality is opposite of what you suggest)\n\nThe value of the coins comes from the market: Those who want to own some coins or more coins than they have (demand), and those who want to have less coins than they have (supply)\n\nThe coin value are the same for all coins, and all other stuff.\n\nOnly the mined, sound coins have the first (cost of mining equals value of new coins)",

Bitcoin Cash is peer to peer money that cannot be frozen by the banks nor the government.\n\n- With Bitcoin Cash, you place your trust in the laws of Math and Cryptography rather than putting your trust in people.\n\n- Send or receive any amount of Bitcoin Cash, to anyone, anywhere, instantly and almost for free. No lengthy bank forms to fill in and no private information required from both the sender and recipient.\n\n- Whenever you are frustrated with the long queues in the bank to make a transaction, imagine how much time you had wasted, and how many millions other people are wasting their time in the bank queues every single day. Bitcoin Cash saves time and money for millions of people every single day.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash helps to connect the billions of unbanked people, with valuable talents and expertise, to the global economy, creating millions of new job opportunities and increasing economic growth for the entire world.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash enables micro transactions so you can write articles or create video contents and earn money immediately by people who like your work.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash has high volatility which could be seen as an issue or an opportunity, depending on your perspective. If something is $1 today and 20 years later, it is still $1, then there is no investment opportunity.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash protects your purchasing power from inflation and hyperinflation, similar to gold and silver, because it exists outside the banking system of fiat money.\n\n- Unlike fiat money, Bitcoin Cash cannot be counterfeited, so there is zero chance of you holding fake money.\n\n- New bank regulations with regards to bail-ins and bail-outs means the banks can confiscate depositors funds legally and anytime during a financial crisis and there is no recourse for you.\n\n- Banks can shut down and disappear along with the depositors money but Bitcoin Cash has a perfect track record of being online 24 hours a day, every single day, and had been doing so since 2009.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash payments, with CashShuffle and CashFusion, are private Internet money. This means you can send/receive money with anyone privately without having to give out your private information, useful in situations when you want to donate money to an organization without risk being implicated in the process.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is an insurance against corrupted governments. Given a long enough time, eventually a group of corrupted politicians will win the election and take control over the country to enrich themselves. Bitcoin Cash gives you the freedom to move your wealth anywhere and relocate anytime to a safer haven.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash allows you to bypass financial censorships, restrictions and sanctions because it is unstoppable peer to peer money.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today.\n\n- If you were aware of the protests currently going on in Hong Kong, India, Iran, Chile, Bolivia, and other countries, you have to wonder how a minority government could suppress and control millions of citizens.\n\nTurns out if you have an unlimited money printing machine, you could control the entire nation. You could use it to pay for the police and military to beat up the civilians. You could use it to bribe the politicians to look the other way. You could use it to pay for propaganda campaigns. You could use it to invest in companies to prevent them from speaking up.\n\nWhen you remove their unlimited money printing machine, you also reduce their ability to suppress and control the people. Suddenly, the power shifts back into the people\u2019s hands because nobody can print more Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash\u2019s supply is fixed and there will only be 21 million Bitcoin Cash forever.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is programmable money which allows for smart contracts, tokens, oracles, dividends, anonymous bearer shares, and so much new innovations that wasn\u2019t possible before. It is like the very early periods of the Internet age where it is a rapidly evolving technology and crazy amount of new innovations happen regularly and yet people barely know anything about the Internet at that point.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Benefits of Bitcoin Cash for Merchants**\n\n- Bitcoin Cash transactions are instant and safe.\n\n- Risk of chargebacks is nearly zero.\n\n- No more worries about credit card frauds.\n\n- No more worries about centralized payment systems such as PayPal freezing or stealing your money like what had happened to thousands of PayPal users.\n\n- No payment processing fee. As a merchant, you receive 100% of the amount paid to you by the customer.\n\n- Super easy to get started. Just install the Bitcoin.com Wallet and the Bitcoin Cash Register App and you can start accepting Bitcoin Cash payments within minutes.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash does not stigmatize or treat any businesses differently. If you run an organization that banks or governments may not like, you risk having your funds being confiscated anytime like what happened to the funds donated to help Hong Kong Protestors. Bitcoin Cash cannot be taken away by the banks nor the government without your permission.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**How You Can Help This Peer To Peer Cash Revolution**\n\n- Spend Bitcoin Cash whenever possible. You can buy anything with Bitcoin Cash on Amazon today with up to 30% using the Purse.io service. You can pay for air tickets, hotels, food and other services using Bitcoin Cash today. Visit AcceptBitcoin.Cash or Map.Bitcoin.com to look for participating merchants today!\n\n- Pay your employees in Bitcoin Cash to help build a closed loop economy. Request to be paid in Bitcoin Cash if you\u2019re the employee.\n\n- Help educate and spread the benefits of Bitcoin Cash to family and friends, or you can just direct them to this page!\n\n- Make small donations to open source developers contributing their free time voluntarily to build applications and services for the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.\n\n- Everytime someone tries to sell you something, ask them if they accept Bitcoin Cash.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSource: https://slp.1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame",

I prefer using money that is fair to the working people, and not just benefiting the ones at the top. By spending Bitcoin Cash, we're increasing the network effects such that more people have it and they are incentivized to spread it as well. Imagine you creating a new crypto, only you have it, what's the point? The point is that you have to spend it, and when 6 billion people have the crypto you have and are using it, then that's the whole point. That's how it became successful. Bitcoin didn't become where it is today had Satoshi Nakamoto hoarded everything to himself and don't spend it. The reason it's successful is because it was spent.",

Everyone is buying the Horsemobile -- the version of the automobile that works like [this.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Vienti_with_car.png/716px-Vienti_with_car.png?20100131210552) Horsemobile is built by the market darling Blockcar. Demand for Horsemobiles is through the roof. People who bought Model Ts are getting laughed at everywhere they go for buying a shitcar.\n\nPeople like me come onto the internet to complain that the Horsemobile doesn't actually liberate anyone from horses, which was the entire point of the horseless carriage.\n\nYou show up to point out that stupid Henry Ford isn't getting anywhere with his \"motor cult\" and remind everyone that people who live on unpaved dirt roads will always want horses. You feel very smart because history is proving you correct.\n\nBy the way I don't *completely* disagree with your point. Has Roger's adoption effort resulted in overwhelming market success for BCH? No. By that token, I'm not sure what work you're doing to cause BCH to be a market darling, but it has also failed, as has mine and everyone else's here.\n\nYou got a better idea? You don't need to ask for permission....\n\nThere are only a few (3-4) coins that are in any way market successes. In general their success is 100% the result of pure hype and all of them have deep structural problems. Maybe \"keep calm and dev on\" is actually still a good strategy.",

What you presented is a circular argument, and besides, there are stablecoins like FlexUSD that people can use on BCH.\n\n> These people are taking your money and hoping you continue to buy this dream so they can be funded through flipstarters\n\nYou're ascribing an intention to people as if you know what their ultimate motivations are. Roger has been involved in promoting peer to peer electronic cash for the world for more than 11 years. Roger is most likely diversified well enough to not need anybody's investments, so your argument about him being able to \"stay on his yacht\" is pure ad hom nonsense.\n\n> Onboarding a business is not helpful, it is not necessary\n\nActually it is one of the most helpful activities in the cryptoverse right now, if your aim is p2p cash in wide use everywhere. It is necessary to be accepted as a means of payment. And BCH can do that job well.\n\n> There is no BIG MOMENT coming when the world wakes up and sees bitcoin cash is peer to peer electronic cash.\n\nCorrect, it is a gradual awakening to the possibilities and benefits that Bitcoin (Cash) offers.\n\nIt is unstoppable.",

Yeah, many cryptocurrency projects w smart contract behavior do end up proliferating the lowest common denominator (defi yield farms at the moment).

And for those that are, there are some interesting projects which are attempting to innovate which provide utility (on top of the profit which also comes along with it). For ex goblins cash (lending market), and viegage (smart contract REIT). Even blockng, while NFT focused, have interesting mechanics which they are playing around with and create an interesting ecosystem of tokens for various functions. They are in various stages of maturity, but certainly in innovation territory. These may attract a speculative crowd, but these are providing utility outside of the money they happen to also generate.\n\nAnd FWIW, sBCH has seen a steady growth of gas fee burn (which is the direct result of tx on-chain).

I have a problem with the way you are defining value.\n\nAs long as one coin is considered to have value, this paves the way for all other blockchains to grow their network. They can justify themselves based on their features vs BCH. \n\nThe world already looks like this if you support BCH and believe it is undervalued.\n\nBCH is a PoW network. So, other PoW networks get a pass to grow indefinitely. Whether there is enough adoption doesn't matter to investors mining in the short term. \n\nWe all know what the astroturfing and misinformation looks like from maxis. No network of maximalists will give in because BCH achieves some sort of moral victory... It's gonna be the same story it's been since the fork. Centralizing vs decentralizing.\n\nUnchecked networks will bleed the earth dry of energy. I've read the Nic Carter articles people like to share here but they all assume good actors. Just last week I saw a tutorial on how to casually mine BCH using your GPU. We are sooooooo far past that being ethical. This community is permissive to a fault. \n\nYou can have freedom cash, but its advantages do and will continue to pale in comparison to the waste it brings via competing networks.\n\nI am confident that support for PoW mining would be the primary reason for global warming reaching over 1.5 degrees Celcius. We are living through a \"now-or-never\" moment according to leading climate science supporting the Paris Agreement.\n\nI already saw in a past comment that you welcome societal collapse. I do not. So, I don't expect you to agree... I'm leaving this comment here anyway because I feel obligated to articulate my position when I find BCH zealots.",

Crypto can be studied and modeled for years to come in academic settings, but the earth can't survive deployment at the scale required for mass adoption. If you don't understand the 1.5 Celcius number, there is a lot of science already conducted to back up its importance in the next 8 years. Your dismissal of climate change risks is naiive, as is your assertion that crypto can fix it if it's actually a problem.\n\nWe can have an energy solution without BTC. It may take a little longer without the investment from crypto, but that won't burn the planet out in the meantime.\n\nYou said yourself that nuclear power is a solution. But it's not happening at scale right now. I am definitely looking ahead but I'm not grasping at straws. 8 years from now all the mining isn't going to take place in sustainable Texas hydrofarms, and especially not BCH. We will be over the 1.5 Celcius threshhold.\n\nI do think batteries will get better at storing energy that would have been wasted. In fact I think crypto mining is surely limiting innovation on that front by using flared gas and other forms of stranded energy. It gives energy producers incentive not to invest in that R&D.\n\nIn order to limit the waste from front-loading costs (since it's expensive to make batteries and other eco-friendly solutions), we have to drop the demand on energy first. Otherwise they will get built out in an unsustainably quick way which will also be a drain on the planet.\n\nI can go on but I've made my point and you're welcome to present contrary evidence.",

As far as I know, the BCH community isn't consulted in anyway for changes to your protocol. Development cannot be anything but centralized. That leaves nodes. What's your definition of decentralized? Number of nodes collectively controlling 50% of the network being over 3? Or some other arbitrary number?\n\nMaybe you're saying there isn't actually a network of miners on BSV. BSV nodes are not actually different nodes but all the same company? And have to be running out of the same warehouse? Users are unknowingly broadcasting to the same system all the time? Aside from making absolutely no sense, I'm afraid I can only take this as wishful conjecture until you prove it. It'd be some expos\u00e9.\n\nWhere **exactly** is the scam? Is it the revolutionary IP coming out of nChain (who I am unaffiliated with)? The easily verifiable network capacity? Maybe it's the crazy price hikes BSV experiences all the time.

The \"genuine BTC holders\" you speak of - why would they be interested in the particular symbols you mentioned? Everytime I look on one of the mainstream Bitcoin social media platforms, they seem to call everything except BTC a \"shitcoin\".\n\nPerhaps some signs indicating a more balanced, not so aloof attitude would be useful to the world.",

                    "response": "There was an upgrade in November 2020 to adjust the dynamic hashrate difficulty algorithm for BCH. But it didn't change the price.\n\nHashrate follows price.\n\nPrice is openly manipulated in two very different schemes.\n\nFirst, BTC (and other assets) are inflated with BTC-backed fractional reserve stablecoins. Parties take stablecoin loans using BTC as collateral. When the price drops, they are forced to buy more BTC to recollateralize their loan.\n\nThe above fractional reserve system is a ponzi, but it's VERY stable. It's revenue positive, maintained by major market participants (including exchanges), and provides a method of raising and loaning new capital to various friendly parties, which didn't exist in crypto before stablecoins.\n\nIn short, the fractional fiat stablecoin ponzi is *like dynamite*. It's USEFUL to the people using it, and probably won't blow up unless the people using it want it to. It can be shipped, used, jostled, dropped, etc. but it won't blow up.\n\nSecond, the naked shorting of fixed-supply UTXO currencies is the other means of price manipulation. This is where a party receives a loan of hard-currency at a specific fiat price to sell on the open market. It may either be loaned by the end-consumer for a fraction of the interest, or \"borrowed\" from the omnibus account of a so called \"custodial\" service provider.\n\nIn stark contrast to stablecoin manipulation, borrowing ultra-hard currency at a fiat rate is revenue negative, it is also subject to pressures of fiat inflation, and (unlike fraudulent equity markets) all assets are real and on a blockchain from the start.\n\nSo although BCH hasn't really moved from \\~$350 for several years, if there are people committed to using a portion of the paycheck to purchase it, it's HIGHLY likely they're making significantly more than they were in 2017 when it started. Under constant buying pressure, the buying on pressure on shorts doubles when the fiat currency purchasing power halves and wages adjust.\n\nTo close a short position can involve significant buying pressure, especially on chains with low on-chain transaction volume (3%-8%/month).\n\nIn brief, although naked-shorting of currencies like BCH and XMR have been very successful at knocking down the perceived market-cap, the practice involves the financial equivalent of **liquid nitroglycerine**. It's not safe, stable, easy or something that can be maintained long term.\n\nThe downside loss potential from shorting a few million DOGE is **GREATER THAN** the market capitalization of all stablecoins and BTC rehypothecation **combined**. Regardless of what you think of DOGE as a currency, it's an actual cryptocurrency, shorting it carries the potential for **INFINITE LOSSES**. If you disagree, or don't understand that fact, you don't understand the risks of naked shorting.\n\nSo BCH ran a campaign to \"Bring them home\" urging users to withdraw all Bitcoin Cash from exchanges. XMR ran a campaign last week (monerun). It's easy for an price manipulator to counter individual campaigns by shorting other currencies for cash, since they have that facility.\n\nWhen the big thing happens, a lot of instruments may collapse at once. BTC rehypothecation, stablecoins, equity markets, bonds, etc. There will be a lot of narratives telling you it was caused by the collapse of some obscure off-shore real estate firm. I can assure you with absolute certainty, what actually caused it was the naked shorting of ultra-hard currencies for hyper-inflationary fiat exchange prices, and users that had control of their private keys will do just fine.",

But instead of the fund buying and holding shares, they bought and loaned shares in retail companies to shorts, and then allowed shares of the fund to be shorted 1000%. Instead of profiting from increased share prices from \"investing\" in retail, you're actually providing liquidity to hedge-funds and exposing yourself to their default risk. And they are trading against you in defiance of the Fund's fiduciary responsibility. \n\nWith enough excess (hedge-funds shorting entire indices), you can hopefully see how millions of people investing tens of thousands of dollars in ETFs can lead to trillions of dollars in derivatives with little actual investment in the underlying securities\u2014or in short, no actual investment and a LOT of counter-party liabilities.\n\nThe SEC has explicitly taken the position that cryptocurrency ETFs should be exclusively speculative instruments based on futures and options. They will merely be an instrument for market manipulators in Chicago to defraud individuals who want *investment* access to cryptocurrencies, but are instead willing to purchase a *speculative* instrument which never invests.\n\nThe SEC does not want to **ever** approve **any kind** of ETF that is backed by a cryptocurrency or allows for dynamic price discovery.\n\nThe body \"protecting\" investors is just herding people up the cattle ramp.\n\nIf you want cryptocurrency, there is never going to be a third party that can hold your private keys for you. \n\nThe might be a lot of people who never want to touch a US market ETF again when \"tracking-errors\" and \"one time losses\" from inflation affecting security lending are priced in.",

Increase in price depend on new users, it sounds like a pyramid, but really that is what is going on. Both coins are really small compared to the world population.\n\nIf you are only interested in international transfer, then BCH wins flat out, but there is also the speculative element, that was the only basis for the value the first years, it is still important, then go for the coin that can accomodate many users.",

            "selftext": "We have the leverage because if they try to put kyc on native wallets or felonize, extradite, or intimidate developers for coding, or blackball smart contracts, give \"defi licenses\" to CME chicago good ole boys, we will dedollarize & pull everything out of the US. US gets nothing.\n\nLook at what Tom Duffy and the CME are doing to our industry, this decrepit guy is admitting to the US ag hearing what he & his crony did the last 4 year to us. If they try to give licenses to DeFi w/ gate keeping, Dedollarize everything, let them know.\n\nYou know how easy it is to just write a front end that shows the usd dollar amount of a completely different stable coin pegged to god knows what. Dedollarization.\n\nJust build collateralized stable coins tied to a basket of 50 different currencies and 20 or 30 treasuries, plus 20 or 30 commodities, if these nation state want to do reflexivity attacks on the collateral, they'll have to short every major currency in every major country in the world. Invent our own peg. Over collateralize it to peg it to a past snap shot of itself at a given index of valued assets. It can be done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately I believe normalizing stablecoin pegs to the US dollar was just a mistake and a giant lever of power for the gov to enforce kyc & gatekeeping for banking cartels on everything & one, to utterly destroy censorship resistance in the crypto ecosystem.  \nThis means a stateless currency pegged to \"things\" (in small .0001 decimal place value) is going to have to be anonymously made, collateralized, run by anonymous devs, or built in a failsafe way. The US gov only understands fraud, force, & violence & coercion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Why flee the collapsing USD for a digital version pegged to it? Gtfo stables in general, stick to future proof currency that deflates over time. Screw stables full stop.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who has money on the line, or most advanced finance and fund management is going to just expose themselves to bitcoin and it's serious lack of stability, or any other deflationary asset. The concept of not having credit expansion or inflation in some degree, and some stability in asset price, is complete btc maxi peter pan stuff. I'm literally not talking about pegging it to the US dollar either, I'm talking about pegging it to the aggregate value of about 500 assets in decimal form, specially picked to reduce volatility, and to make impossible for the US gov to engage in reflexivity attacks without crashing the rest of the global economy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor now you cannot put this stablecoin which we will call a \"Defitii\" on Bitcoin Cash's blockchain, and btc cash cannot scale it's nodes well enough because of various engineering challenges (perhaps a lack of sharding for BCH just as with Eth, lack of ubiquitous cheap harddrives, lack of distributed storage doing what is tantamount to sharding to increase total # of nodes) \n\nBut it would be highly advantageous to BCH to get it onto it's chain.
