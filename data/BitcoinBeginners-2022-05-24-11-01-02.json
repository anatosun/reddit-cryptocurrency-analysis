This has got me thinking about the future and how much of the Web 3.0 is actually yet to be introduced, shaped and defined as phenomenon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat, to your mind, are the cornerstone ideas or solutions that are not yet on the surface but are inevitably coming to the Web 3.0 world?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs Web 3.0 complete in its current definition or is it an evolving concept that's yet to be clearly categorized?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill hugely appreciate your insights as I try to shape my understanding of it.",
