After jumping through several billion hoops, it turns out for some reason they just ain't accepting my ID no matter how clear the pics are taken or how many times I re-typed the information, so it's currently stuck on pending verification\n\nFrom what I saw it says it'll automatically cancel if the transaction doesn't go through, but anyone know how long that takes?\n\nEDIT: Nevermind, I saw that it'll get canceled after 72 hours",
