And it really has only been 2 weeks since they started paying out ADA staking rewards and lowered the APY rate. You call support to question what is going on and you get transfered from 1 department to another i'm assuming somewhere in Bangalore because you cannot understand a word being spoke for 45 minutes til you say nevermind and hang up, or email tickets that say we hope this solved your issue and we are closing your case when they have answered nothing. I joined coinbase over a year ago and have held over 3,000 ADA since then, you would think since coinbase was suppose to offer cardano staking a year ago which was why i joined in the first place they would back pay rewards, but instead they choose to screw people, it may be time to move on.",
