Dealing with an exchange is a point of trust: you have to trust the exchange that they let you transfer your coins out in the end. That's why it's recommended to NOT let your coins on there for longer periods of time (or any periods, for that matter).  \n\n> I want to see what the balance is, if any. How do I see if there\u2019s any Bitcoin left? Is there a way to determine which of the 2 keys I have is the private or public?  \n\nIt's possible to recognize them because pubkeys and privkeys have different formats, but I can't help with it from my memory right now. You can try importing either of those into a proper wallet like Electrum: https://electrum.org/ (and play around with different ways of importing them, as depending on how your previous wallet was created, it might show a 0 balance even if it's not empty, so you might need to figure out the \"right\" recovery settings.. but it's not that many, so don't worry).",

Maybe a dumb question, but...\n\nDuring the Canada trucker protests, when we saw donations to the cause being frozen by the state, it seemed like Bitcoin's moment to shine, and every other post on social media claimed that 'Bitcoin fixes this!'\n\nBut, to my eyes, it seemed like the solution fell short. While a person could donate to a Bitcoin wallet that was purportedly tied to the protests, that donation didn't do them any good if they had no way to convert that Bitcoin to dollars. Obviously, the recipient couldn't directly use Bitcoin to buy groceries or gas, they'd need to sell that Bitcoin to get money into their bank account, and that transfer to the bank account could be prevented or frozen. Same goes for trying to use a service like PayPal to broker the transaction between a Bitcoin wallet and a store - PayPal can (and will) cave to state pressure in these situations.\n\nI understand that P2P transfers are basically beyond state control, which sounds good in principle, but eventually \\*someone\\* has to transfer that Bitcoin to cash and interact with the regular economy, and it seems to me like that attempted transfer will always be under the control of the state. Is there something I'm missing here?\n\nThanks!",

Start an email that is not specific to your personal information from a privacy oriented provider (proton mail for example). Only use this email for the one exchange account - nothing else. Use strong password formatting/keeping.\n\n2. Use a vpn showing you from a less regulation-oriented country (ex. GT), open an exchange account with a provider that allows for decent daily withdrawal limits for unverified accounts (ex. Kucoin allows <1BTC/day). Always show your activity from that country.\n\n3. Don\u2019t use your phone number (SMS) for verification purposes.\n\n4. Fund your exchange account through sources that don\u2019t know or KYC you. Example, peer to peer, Bisq, Coinshack (<$600/day as of today). All of these sources won\u2019t perform KYC and will allow you to stage value into and out of the cryptosphere. \n\n5. NEVER commingle your new under-the-table activity with KYC end points.\n\nAt least that\u2019s how I would do it, if I was ever gonna do it, not that I have.

I agree it\u2019s pretty stupid to have every small transaction take up space on the blockchain, but this is why lightning is being developed. \n\nLightning is a second layer protocol, that allows you to use Bitcoin similar to using a bank account and cash. You can make one transaction on chain to load up your lightning wallet with \u201ccash\u201d and then use it to make small purchases on the lighting network without having to record it on the blockchain until you run out of funds.\n\nThis way, the blockchain is similar to your bank statement, where you only record one transaction when you take out money from an ATM and daily spendings are done off-chain.",

Two participants create a ledger entry on the blockchain which requires both participants to sign off on any spending of funds. Both parties create transactions which refund the ledger entry to their individual allocation, but do not broadcast them to the blockchain. They can update their individual allocations for the ledger entry by creating many transactions spending from the current ledger entry output. Only the most recent version is valid, which is enforced by blockchain-parsable smart-contract scripting. This entry can be closed out at any time by either party without any trust or custodianship by broadcasting the most recent version to the blockchain.",

There\u2019s two parts there:\n\nFirst, not considering lightning, because it\u2019s new and not very common yet. When you don\u2019t use lightning, then every transaction is done on-chain. That means, it\u2019s registered on the blockchain forever, no matter how small. \n\nSecond: there\u2019s a new development called lightning which avoids that, by adding a second layer to Bitcoin that allows a different way of making transactions. This is what avoids recording every transaction on the blockchain. But only if both the sender and the receiver do actually use lighting. It\u2019s not as easy as doing transactions on-chain, and both parties need to use a lightning node to transact. This is a special software that has to be running and connected to the lightning network as the same time so they can perform the transaction. \n\nLightning is quite new and experimental. It works pretty well, but it\u2019s still not widespread enough. So when you ask about the blockchain and every transaction being recorded on it, the standard answer is yes assuming that lightning is not used.\n\nEdit: it\u2019s like when someone asks: \u201cDo you have to use the clutch to change gears when you drive a car?\u201d The answer is \u201cYes, unless you drive automatic\u201d.",

Not chain enforceable so censorship/theft can occur.  \n2) Smart contract based like Lightning Network, Statechains, where if the service becomes unreliable, you can take your funds on-chain after a timeout. They resist censorship/theft to varying degrees, depending on the security model chosen.",
