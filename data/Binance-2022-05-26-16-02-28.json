            "selftext": "A consistent buyer/customer ordered 41k usdt from me using cash deposit as the payment method. While I was waiting for buyer to make the deposit, I accidentally released the asset to the buyer even if I hadn\u2019t received the payment yet. I immediately tried to contact the buyer but the buyer already blocked me. We also had past transactions on a different messaging platform and I was also blocked there. I was really scared that I won\u2019t be able to retrieve my money anymore. I reached out to Merlina and Binance customer service (Alice) and they were able to freeze the buyer\u2019s account as soon as they confirmed I was telling the truth. Luckily, the buyer hadn\u2019t withdrawn the asset out of binance yet and he ended up replying to be when he realized that his account was frozen. I was able to get him to complete the payment. I would really like to thank the Binance team for the fast response",
