If you honestly felt this way, you would have criticism for George as well. Censorship breeds dissent, anyone who really believed what you espouse would know that and be against it. Your hypocrisy exposes you.\n\n>We are talking about an individual. I think individuals deserve some consideration.\n\nI am also an individual but you have no consideration for me. I was censored by George in his furtive effort to win an argument unfairly. You do not consider this at all. Again, your hypocrisy exposes you.\n\n>Finally, something substantive. \n\nGaslighting. This was mentioned from the very beginning. The damage and lies that George committed both against Dash and BCH were referenced in the **very first post**. You completely skipping them and pretending that \"now\" something substantive has been brought up is deceptive and gaslighting. You have engaged in at least 3 forms of dishonest debate in this discussion, which is further proof that you do not believe as you say. Civil discourse completely precludes these techniques which you rely on.\n\n>I never sent money to this person, I don't think. \n\nThis is irrelevant. The members of the BCH community that sent $60,000 USD to him obviously did send money and probably are not as 'forgiving' as you are. And anyway, you have no right to force others to be as forgiving as you are when injustice was done to them. Your defense of criminal behavior further proves that you are not being genuine in your comments.\n\n> I haven't talked to the accused about it.\n\nThe evidence has been presented in the OP and the posts of the thread I was censored from. If you were being honest and forthright, you would've read those posts before beginning your defense. This is further evidence that you are being hypocritical and dishonest. \n\n> I'm only going on your post for now.\n\nIf you truly were doing that, you would've read all relevant material before beginning your attack on my position. The fact that you admit to having not done this yet is further evidence that you are being dishonest and disingenuous.\n\n>You've made a lot of assumptions about me\n\nNothing I've posted about you is an assumption. Everything I've posted about you is based on the evidence presented in the OP, the original posts of the first thread, and your own behavior and posts here. It is extremely unusual for an adult male to defend another adult male with no cause nor any benefit to themselves. \n\nAs such, you have NO RIGHT to conclude that my evidentiarily arrived at conclusions are \"assumptions\". You may attack the reasoning I used, but calling my conclusions \"assumptions\" with no supporting evidence or rebuttal to my rationale is dishonest and disqualifies you both from civil discourse and from this debate. \n\n>You told me to keep my thoughts to myself, and that is what prompted me to comment further.\n\nSo you usually disrespect the requests of others? This thread isn't about you. This isn't your thread. What right do you have to pollute it with your baseless speculations in defense of someone accused of criminal behavior?",

You don't have a right to disrespect my wishes in my thread about remaining on topic, and you definitely don't have a right to use that trumped up \"suspicion\" to discredit the documented evidence that I have presented.

You are wrong from the beginning because you are not being honest in this discussion. Nothing you are saying in your defense of George Donnelly is relevant to the charges against him which makes your attacks against me hypocritical.\n\n>With regard to the part about being censored; clearly, you're not\n\nYou're wrong. George Donnelly blocked me in his thread after replying to me which prevented me from replying to his comment and made it seem like he \"won\" the discussion. That is the definition of censorship. Just because other venues don't follow that tact doesn't mean his act wasn't censorship. You are literally bending over backwards to defend the indefensible in a subreddit that is dedicated to being against censorship, which means you don't really care about this community.\n\n>If this same exact thread had George Donnelly as OP and you as the accused, I would have made the same comment.\n\nIrrelevant, it didn't and you can't use that as evidence. The simple fact that you ignored consideration for me while giving George donnelly far more than he deserved, (considering you deliberately ignored the evidence against him), indicates that you are biased towards him at the least, and that you actually are him at the most.",

This isn't a \"two minute hate\", he was excommunicated from Dash roughly three years ago, spent two years making hell in BCH (supporting ABC and Amaury, then switching sides, then supporting scams) until he was kicked out and now tries to go back to Dash. Your defense of him is completely nonsensical and unjustified, which makes me think you're a sockpuppet.\n\nNow you've levied an accusation against me.  It seems there could be a pattern here.  Which would support me posting my alternate view.  Notice I'm not seeking to divide, and I am also not name calling.  I noticed a lot of name calling in your post.  If you really want someone kicked out of bitcoin cash (if that's possible) this approach may be the way to convince others, but it probably won't convince me, I'm different.",

That's not very nice and honestly pretty dishonest. \n\nI am definitely \"argumentative\" as argumentation is the only way to find out the truth verbally. If your arguments are better than mine you will win and I will concede, the opposite goes for me if mine are better. But I'm definitely not toxic. If anything, I'm patient to a fault. I waited for 8 months while watching George gaslight and lie to and about the Dash community, this was back in 2019. \n\nI even commended George for his \"field report\" before his toxic behavior came to light. What's more, I am actually quite popular in many communities with many of my posts being highly upvoted. I've posted original research over the years that has been lauded in many communities and by several members of those communities, so you'd be wrong on that account. You're welcome to point out to any episodes of \"toxicity\" of mine that your review has come across and we can discuss the merits of your claims. \n\nThanks",

A mistake is something you do by accident or unknowingly, he didn't fulfill his goals and never gave the money back so that can't be considered as 'a mistake'.

What right do you have to question my support, especially considering the fact that you are defending a serial scammer who defrauded this community out of $60k USD? If anything your support of George is evidence that it is YOU who doesn't support this community. Which means your finger-pointing at me would be projection and hypocrisy. How do you respond?\n\n>I used to watch Amanda B Johnson's videos, but that doesn't make me a Dash supporter, nor do I have any Dash.\n\nStrawman. Watching the videos of someone from a community is not the same as my participation in this sub and it is a strawman to argue as such. When you can show dozens of posts in the r/dashpay subreddit over the years like I have had in r/btc, then you can make an equivalence and not a second sooner.\n\n>You have very little karma on rdashpay as, by your own admission, you are banned there \n\nIrrelevant, I was banned there because I was popular and exposed someone like George who attempted to infiltrate and destroy our community. Still, if you check my karma at r/dashpay is probably the highest out of the subreddits, with r/btc a close second. Either way, there's no way you can impeach my support for this subreddit, especially when you're doing so in support of someone who stole tens of thousands of dollars from this community.\n\nGeorge scammed this community, at least twice, served as the spokeman for the hated ABC development group and Amaury Setchen, argued in favor of the IFP before he unceremoniously \"quit\" and switched sides. Why on earth would you conclude that attacking someone like that is \"hurting BCH\"? You equate attacking someone who scammed the community with \"hurting the community\" which means you are against this community and are attacking it yourself by your support. Supporting scammers is the same as hurting community members. **Again I ask, how do you respond?**\n\n>Your suggestion that I am George's sockpuppet / employee is just a ludicrous assertion for which you have not the slightest evidence - except in your fevered imagination.\n\nIt is not. George has been called out with evidence for using a sockpuppet to defend himself before. George's employee \"Gabriel Alejandro Mitacchione Ruiz\"\nalso aggressively defended him in comments on youtube against people who had legitimate greivences with him, just like you're doing now:\n \n>[Gabriel Alejandro Mitacchione Ruiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFvGTr9L0gc)\n\n>2 years ago\n\n>The Dash Latam team was defunded by a bunch of corrupt insiders that made themselves rich with the funding System by achieving mediocre goals. \n\nAnd\n\n>Gabriel Alejandro Mitacchione Ruiz\n\n>2 years ago\n\n>Dash has got so little to talk about with their new DASH platform piece of crap that they start like old ladies to gossip and talk crap and lies about people that really worked hard for them \n\nThis user was listed as one of the executives on George's panmoni team, so there is both evidence and precedent for the accusation that George relies on sockpuppets and paid employees to provide him cover from accusations of criminal behavior. Thus your claim that my suggestion is a \"ludicrous assertion for which [I] have no the slightest evidence\" is completely false and you expose yourself as a liar and charlatan for claiming as such.\n\n>I don't believe that George \"stole $60,000USD from BCH holders\" and you saying it doesn't make it true.\n\nGeorge promised to deliver 1 Million BCH users by Dec 2021 in his flipstarter. Do you see 1 million users of this coin? Where is your evidence that he fulfilled his obligation? He took money in exchange for that promise and did not deliver which means he failed and stole the money. Its not rocket science.\n\n>You seem to live in a fantasy world where your beliefs are constructed without the slightest evidence.\n\nPot, meet kettle.\n\n>I am adamantly in favour of BCH and have been so ever since August 1'st 2017.\n\nClearly you are not, you are adamantly defending a scammer and liar who gleefully stole tens of thousands of dollars worth of community money, then rage quit due to his smartBCH scam. You're dishonest and again, only the person in question or people in his employ are likely to defend him this ferociously.\n\n>Your use of capitals as in shouting is just vulgar and juvenile.\n\nYour grammar and style lesson is noted, I'll take it under advisement.\n\n>George's remark \"I would like to know why I am a magnet for mentally-ill people. I don't get it.\" makes a lot of sense to me.\n\nIronically, me too. When you project as much as you and George do, everyone else looks like mentally-ill people to you.\n\n>As someone else remarked you are hiding behind a throwaway account\n\n99% of people who use reddit, including you, do this. Putting yourself out there is no excuse for stealing from the community, nor is it protection from accusations of fraud. You shame yourself by relying on such an illogical gambit.\n\n>so your assertion that George is cowardly is hypocritical.\n\nPreposterous. I didn't call George a coward because he \"wouldn't show his face\", I called him a coward because he replied to me and tried to censor me and prevent me from replying back. That's cowardly. Just like you trying to set up and defeat that strawman because you can't deal with my actual arguments.\n\n> I can perfectly understand why he prefers not to receive your messages with their poisonous content.\n\nOf course you can. Most likely because you are him.\n\n>In my opinion it is offensive for you to come here and denigrate people.\n\nIn my opinion, it is offensive for you to come here and defend scammers, liars, gaslighters and criminal behavior.",

Might not be what you think though.\n\n>Once again you make evidence devoid statement \"Of course you can. Most likely because you are him.\"\n\nNo, there's evidence. I posted it several times. Its weird that you're defending someone accused of massive fraud against this community that you claim to be a member of so adamantly.  Evidence #1. George was proven to post in defense of himself using a sockpuppet before in this very subreddit. Evidence #2. George has also had his hirelings defend him adamantly in youtube comments as I provided proof of above. Evidence #3. In fact, you're the one who hasn't provided evidence of your position. that you're not George/in his employ. If he's employed these tactics before it stands to reason that he would do so again. HOW DO YOU RESPOND?\n\n>You have also made the assertion that another person is a George sockpuppet. \n\nIt is possible yes. George stands accused of $300k USD worth of fraud. Not to mention the smartBCH scam. It doesn't cost much to pay people to defend you online, nor are sockpuppets and old reddit accounts expensive. For all we know, Geoge paid the original owner of your account a nice chunk of change, got a list of talking points to make him seem authentic and is just running down that list while also writing a full-throated defense of himself to appear like he has \"support\".\n\nIts possible that conclusion is wrong, but you're not doing yourself any favors by playing dumb to even the possibility of it. Reddit accounts have been sold like that for some time now. Furthermore, the idea that someone who has already proven to behave that way **wouldn't do so under such circumstancse** is actually the unreal position, so it seems it is you that has a tenuous grip on reality. Not accepting your weak statements that you're not George is not the same thing as not grasping reality. Just the fact that you would conflate the two is further evidence that you're dishonest.\n\n>Understand that just because you don't like George doesn't mean that everyone who supports him is a sockpuppet. \n\nUnderstand that I never said that or even insinuated it. Understand that if you wish to win this debate then you MUST respond to what I'm actually saying. I've posted the evidence in support of my conclusion several times and you haven't responded to it directly even once. You won't even acknowledge that George has used sockpuppets and paid hierlings to defend himself with in the past, despite the clearly sourced evidence. That makes you dishonest.\n\n>I don't care about Dash or its community. \n\nOk? \n\n> If you care about Dash, I suggest that you confine your character assassination attempts to the Dash groups.\n\nNo. I will attack any scammer that I see fit and I suggest you find better things to do with your time than trying to police my posting. If you can't respond to my evidence then SHUT UP.\n\n>Sending out your bile to 5 separate subreddits suggests that you have an unhealthy obsession.\n\nCalling well-sourced and supported posts that you disagree with \"bile\" only further serves to provide evidence that you are in George's employ or are him himself. If you're not him, then the fact that you would defend him without even addressing the evidence against him is ironic proof that YOU are the one with the unhealthy obsession and that you're projecting.",
