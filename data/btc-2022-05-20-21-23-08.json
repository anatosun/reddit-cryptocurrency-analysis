The p2p electronic cash community?  The community of persons whom you will fund?  People whose ideas you will grant some consideration?   I ask because I don't always see the utility of cancel culture unless building a cancel cult.   And, let's say excluding someone from circle A may be justifiable; well, I might still want that person welcomed in circle B.  Further, I think there are always many variables and unknowns and possibilities and because of that my goal is to limit my judgments to a person's actions at a particular point in time.  And I tend to be suspicious of two minute hates where we form a circle and point at an individual and repeat the same thing.",

He promised you guys \"1 million new BCH users by Dec 2021\" with his flipstarter. How can you just let him off the hook for that? Unlike Dash's treasury, BCH flipstarters are paid out of the pockets of community members, so he basically stole from all of you. That's the real damage to the community. How can you overlook that??",

What's more, I am actually quite popular in many communities with many of my posts being highly upvoted. I've posted original research over the years that has been lauded in many communities and by several members of those communities, so you'd be wrong on that account. You're welcome to point out to any episodes of \"toxicity\" of mine that your review has come across and we can discuss the merits of your claims. \n\nThanks",

Answer the question and stop dodging, are you George Donnelly or in his employ, yes or no?\n\n>As I said, by posting your bile to 5 different groups, you come across as an unpleasant person involved in character assassination. \n\nGaslighting. George posted a reply to me and blocked me so I couldn't reply back, you're blaming the victim which is dishonest debating. If you really cared about 'unpleasant people' and 'character assassinations' why don't you criticize George for attacking me and preventing me from replying? You're being a hypocrite again.\n\n>You should take that onboard and learn that being obnoxious will only make you enemies\n\nYou talk just like George does. \"Onboard\". I don't mind you being my enemy, you're an asshole and a gaslighter. The kind of people I eat for breakfast.",

George talks about mass adoption, but it becomes kind of a version of fraud, when there is only like US$ 70 in Dash Transactions for the entire region for that quarter, (it was something like this, but correct me if I was wrong)  This was the reason that George got his proposal rejected.  He could had learned from this, instead he rage quit, which was really, really unprofessional and hurt him more than hurt Dash..  \n\nHe used the same rountine for BCH, promising mass adoption, but in reality, how many merchants in Colombia used BCH?  He basically does marketing, but he doesn\u2019t understand anything else..  He also mainly markets himself\u2026.  His promise of a 1 million people adopting BCH, was part of the scam, he doesn\u2019t have the tools or an organization to make this happened.  People were paying him BCH, mainly to advertise himself..  (Also if he cash all the BCH he raised via fundraising.., which kind of hints he didn\u2019t have much faith in BCH).",

I don't really have any interest in this discussion.\n\nYet here you are. Again, you sound just like George does. Always misrepresenting the truth. Misrepresenting the narrative. Misrepresenting his intentions. Just like you do with mine.\n\n> I just thought the tirade was a bit excessive.\n\nWho would think that? **George stole $300k USD from both communities!** In BCH that $60k came OUT OF PEOPLE'S POCKETS! Only George would think \"that tirade is a bit excessive\". \n\n>I don't want to call OP any names. I don't even know them. But I do hope they find a better state of mind soon.\n\nThe only one who needs to improve their 'state of mind' is the person gaslighting others, pretending like they're being neutral and objective when you're deliberately ignoring malicious behavior and theft on one side of the discussion (George's side).",

You may not like it, but I think it's perfectly okay to have another perspective on this.  We are talking about an individual.  I think individuals deserve some consideration.\n\n> George stole $300k USD from both communities! In BCH that $60k came OUT OF PEOPLE'S POCKETS!\n\nFinally, something substantive.  I never sent money to this person, I don't think.  Maybe there is more to the story.  I haven't talked to the accused about it.  I am also not going to vet nor cross examine any accusers.  (As you know, that is what we used to do in the prior civilization we had, before social media.)  I'm only going on your post for now.  And if what you say is true, I think he should pay it back.  \n\nYou've made a lot of assumptions about me: I'm pretending this, deliberately ignoring that, misrepresenting the other thing, gaslighting, and worse.  Maybe it's possible you could be wrong about some or all of this.  Maybe there are some things you haven't thought of?  Other persons might think differently than you do.  I'm not trying to be neutral or objective.  You told me to keep my thoughts to myself, and that is what prompted me to comment further.",
