That's not very nice and honestly pretty dishonest. \n\nI am definitely \"argumentative\" as argumentation is the only way to find out the truth verbally. If your arguments are better than mine you will win and I will concede, the opposite goes for me if mine are better. But I'm definitely not toxic. If anything, I'm patient to a fault. I waited for 8 months while watching George gaslight and lie to and about the Dash community, this was back in 2019. \n\nI even commended George for his \"field report\" before his toxic behavior came to light. What's more, I am actually quite popular in many communities with many of my posts being highly upvoted. I've posted original research over the years that has been lauded in many communities and by several members of those communities, so you'd be wrong on that account. You're welcome to point out to any episodes of \"toxicity\" of mine that your review has come across and we can discuss the merits of your claims. \n\nThanks",

A mistake is something you do by accident or unknowingly, he didn't fulfill his goals and never gave the money back so that can't be considered as 'a mistake'.

It is delusional for you to even suggest it. \n\nSo why are you defending him so hard? It is unusual for an adult male to defend another adult male this much, especially when they are in the wrong. George engaged in an act of censorship which you completely ignored, which indicates you have personal or professional motivations in your stalwart defense.\n\nAnd it is NOT delusion, george was proven to defend himself using a sockpuppet account already just a couple months ago. Its delusional for you to think your whole-hearted defense of someone else is normal.\n\n>and as I don't find you pleasant I will stop responding to you.\n\nYou should've kept your mouth shut in the first place, George. Your refusal to answer even the simplest questions above lends credence to the claim that you're professionally tied to George in some way, if not him masquerading as someone else himself.",

The p2p electronic cash community?  The community of persons whom you will fund?  People whose ideas you will grant some consideration?   I ask because I don't always see the utility of cancel culture unless building a cancel cult.   And, let's say excluding someone from circle A may be justifiable; well, I might still want that person welcomed in circle B.  Further, I think there are always many variables and unknowns and possibilities and because of that my goal is to limit my judgments to a person's actions at a particular point in time.  And I tend to be suspicious of two minute hates where we form a circle and point at an individual and repeat the same thing.",
