In this video, we\u2019re going to experiment with Dogecoin, a first-ever memetic coin and Elon Musk\u2019s favorite crypto.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7-x1qWAkk&ab\\_channel=GetBlock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7-x1qWAkk&ab_channel=GetBlock)\n\nBeing a veteran Litecoin fork, Dogecoin is mined on the same equipment. In January 2021, Dogecoin rallied 10x in 12 hours and triggered canine coins mania.  Our DevOps gurus will demonstrate how our clients access Dogecoin shared nodes to check the number of last block mined.
