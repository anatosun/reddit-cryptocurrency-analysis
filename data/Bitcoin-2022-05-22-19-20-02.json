I wondering if there is a way to rebuy after my stop-limit order executes on Binance. \n\nFor example, I have a bitcoin and my stop limit is $28,000, but it's possible that the price can drop below 28,000 and soar up, and I will lose money, so is there a way to set stop-limit order, and then rebuy if it recovers.",

Or something like that. It's been awhile, but I remember being able to verify a mnemonic phrase in 10 or 15 minutes I think.\n\nI guess that's not too helpful since you don't have a Trezor set up with the same secret as your Ledger...\n\nBut if you understand the risks of entering a mnemonic phrase into a general-purpose computer and think you can mitigate those risks, then go for it.. but if I were you I would consider the secret potentially-compromised and immediately create a new wallet after doing so.
