They said, its about helping me in understanding concepts by doing live trade and invest small amount. I am aware that these people could be scammer. But then, there was one person who credited into my account x number of usdt to start with short term trading. I did traded with the person and made 4x profit. It appears lucrative to me when a person lend me money and multiply Profits at a high number. My question here is, how scammer work their way out? when they help and maybe in future they scam!",
