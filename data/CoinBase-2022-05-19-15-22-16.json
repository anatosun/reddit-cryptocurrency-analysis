Look up Roulette, and how to play it to win.\n\nYou've come here asking for gotchas you can't know about until after you have years experience.  Here's one: 85% of the top 500 cryptocoins are textbook ponzies, that's not hyperbole as in: \"I hate them because I lost money on them\" but instead: \"The ONLY concept buoying these instruments is the hope and faith that another man will come by later to buy them from you at a higher price\".  WLUNA is an example of one of those Ponzies extinguishing.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y\\_otSD3LYCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_otSD3LYCA)\n\nCoinbase:ANKR is fundamentally identical to Terra/LUNA/Wluna/UST arbitrage to stablecoin's foundational system and so it's certain that ANKR will surprise return to 0 like WLUNA did at some point in the future.  The payout of ANKR is a ponzie and comes from more people investing over time.  When that stops, the entire rigging has zero value and everyone runs to the door.  Tulip bulbs that sell for a billion dollars each.  You're playing hot potato with a lit firecracker wick length invisible.\n\n80% of all cryptocoins in your basket will sink 100% of your investment as did Coinbase:WLUNA.  The government is starting to no longer fool-around about the general public tearing their divine right to create debt, burden the general public with the servicing of that debt (Failure = Jail) then issue the buying power of those debts (to them assets) to themselves to continue their divine right to rule.  The SEC, Congress, Fed and everyone are in unanimous agreement (their irritations notwithstanding) that what coinbase is doing here is ONLY allowed briefly and in so far that the Feds are going to run into their server room, Wrap Coinbase like a Burrito, move it to a secret government building for regaining the right to create money and issue it.  Using a 7 nation army to destroy it if it resists.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxxyDMBRu9E&t=609s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxxyDMBRu9E&t=609s)\n\nThat being said,80% of your cryptos will be worth 0.  Of the 20% remaining, one will have risen by a million percent in 20 years (might not be in the top 10 cryptos by marketcap).  The next 2 best performers will increase between 100% and 500%.  The rest will have the same value you put in even after the Fed replaces the US dollar with some other rigged arrangement (after having shed their 700 trillion USD in 40 year debt), it'll be a FedCoin or maybe a basket of crypto some of which are buoyed by real estate or a basket of rights to evict plebians from their homes when you feel like it.  Power is Money.\n\nYou are standing next to a man playing Roulette at a Casino.  Don't put your life savings into it.  Only invest in this machiavellian company what you can stomach losing 100% of. There's no apologies when you lose it all and you will, they get their rake on transaction and will not make you whole on these ponzies.  Nor will their execs go to jail like Bernie Madoff who did the same thing.\n\nIn exchange for your 100% loss of funds on 80% of the arrangements, the good news: there's a 1 in 3 chance of a 1 million percent gain or more.  You're the bitcoin insider in May of 2009 who bought 10 thousand bitcoins for $40 two pizzas delivered.  \n\nNow is a great time to enter crypto relative to the last 12 months, we're nearly at max pain with the old timers here having suffered 90% losses from former highest highs.  Some will hold on, and the thousand and ten thousand percent gains will sooth those wounds.  Again.  Not a game.  This is Pitch and Toss.  Read the religious scriptures your parents gave you, and do what it says in regard to gambling games such as Roulette or Poker where the square root of the players leave with everyone else's money.\n\nYou are all nomads tending your sheep on a mountain slope of Thrace and you can't defend your house from the annual mongol raids and you're mad about it.  What you're looking for is an Alexander the Great to stand on a soap box and say \"Worship me as God\" sling me, and I'll share net gains on godpower gained, plus interest.  [https://youtu.be/RlKJDwViNKs?t=31](https://youtu.be/RlKJDwViNKs?t=31)\n\nProblem is, you can't tell the difference between real mccoy, and honeypots that lead to the barnyard's conveyor that leads to the meat packing factory.  You are Gambling make your time.",

That USDC was converted to USD to trade with on Pro (USD spreads are tighter then USDC on pairs).  Week or so passed made a profit on the trade and decided to test the withdrawal feature since I have heard horror stories from missing withdrawals and accounts getting locked do the AML.\n\nWell requested the ACH back to the same institution it was deposited from, 4 business days later it has not arrived and the financial institution has no record of any incoming ACH deposits.  So I contact support about said missing withdrawal and all the needed information.  Their response was:  \n\n\n*\"After reviewing the information provided, it looks like we are missing  the transaction hash URL, which is vital to viewing transactions on the  blockchain. Our system is unable to process screenshots of the  transaction hash, so please provide it to us by copying and pasting the  transaction hash URL in text form.\"*\n\nSo I had to respond to that to see if they even read the support message or you just have some bot looking for keywords then send some can'd response message.  No wonder everyone is short this stock.  At this rate they can cover at $0",
