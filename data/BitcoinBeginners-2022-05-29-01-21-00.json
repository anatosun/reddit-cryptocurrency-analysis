The answers to most of my more exotic tax questions have been found in  [Koinly's crypto tax questions discussion](https://discuss.koinly.io/c/tax-questions/7).They also have pretty decent and relatively easy to read [crypto tax blogs/guides](https://koinly.io/blog/) that are suitable for anyone encountering crypto tax for the first time. Saved me so much time and reduced my anxiety levels no end.\n\nFor anyone that wants to dive a bit deeper into the rabbit hole, I would recommend [Prof. Gary Gensler's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gensler), 'Blockchain & Money' course from 2018 that is available both via [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63UUkfL0onkxF6MYgVa04Fn), or, with all the slides, readings, study questions and assignments included via [MIT's OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/video_galleries/video-lectures/).\n\nNone of the above is financial advice.
