I used to enjoy Warren when she called out rich assholes publically. Don't enjoy her crypto takes but I'm not surprised. Bitcoin was never designed to give out equal equity. If anything cryptocurrency will further divide rich and poor. I don't think that is specific to cryptocurrency so I don't fault it like Warren does. It's simply a function of capitalism.
