But I think that's not the case, right?  \n\n\nI was wondering is it possible to leave it to your family as you did with other things through your will, is it necessary to go through some legal procedure?  \n\n\nImagine people who have I dunno like Bitcoin, numerous tokens, Unicoins which the invested in some companies or BAYC NFTs, there needs to be a solution to somehow leave as a legacy to your family or to whom you already want, right?  \n\n\nAnd I have another question for you, what do the people in countries where cryptocurrencies are forbidden, and how will their family members deal with legal procedures in that case?  \n\n\nI thought maybe in that case where we have countries that don't accept crypto, it would be necessary to use service exchanges such as Coinbase, cause I guess this service has a way to pass crypto assets to the third party in case of the owner's death.  \n\n\nHave you ever thought about it?",
