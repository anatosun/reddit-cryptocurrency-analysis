Now-a-days there are countless reasons to do this but pulling all my BTC off the exchanges and into my Bitbox02 is a feeling I can't really describe. It's like owning something for real that no one could take away, ever, for the first time \n\nFor the record, I used the BTC only version of Bitbox because honestly, I've heavily gravitated to only buying BTC and this wallet lessens the security risks by only using BTC. It's easy, safe and important. \n\nI will let my alts ride, all with under $200 each in them but I'm climbing towards 0.1 BTC and see myself only buying BTC from here out. \n\nCircle of crypto life I guess, you live and learn!",

And it has no dependencies except for hashlib. The interface is terminal. Just supply private key on std in and it prints the addresses.\n\nThe use case is secure generation of wallet address. The code is so trivial that you can easily examine that it doesn't load any other library than sys and hashlib (or my custom hashwal implementation). So does not have access to anything. It doesn't even generate the private key, so there isn't an issue of it supplying you a badly generated key.\n\nBut honestly, it is just a hobby project and I want to print it on a T-shirt. Nonetheless, it is fully functional. And it is definitely smallest wallet generator out there. It kind of demonstrates that the security of BitCoin can really be put on a single sheet of paper.\n\n[https://ibb.co/album/4n3SC5](https://ibb.co/album/4n3SC5)",
