Essentially, rollup operators should post compressed forms of transaction data on the main chain (Ethereum) so that others (full nodes, light nodes) can check the data availability. \n\nHowever, for the time being, ethereum's scalability is limited, so the space is insufficient to save the data from rollups, resulting in the scalability limitation of rollup networks. However, using rollup networks is costly and slow. Polygon Avail is solely concerned with data availability. Execution layers, such as rollups, can use Avail to dump their transaction data, significantly improving rollup scalability. \n\nIt's only the beginning. There are numerous projects currently underway in Polygon's ecosystem. Rollups alone are insufficient. Polygon Avail will strengthen the entire Polygon ecosystem, including the PoS chain and other scaling solutions that will be introduced. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe Ethereum has ever been scaled in this way. I'd like to hear your thoughts.",

Does anyone have a step by step guide I can follow please to cancel the transaction please? I've tried to follow the myetherwallet guide...\n\n[https://help.myetherwallet.com/en/articles/5461454-canceling-or-replacing-a-transaction-after-it-s-been-sent](https://help.myetherwallet.com/en/articles/5461454-canceling-or-replacing-a-transaction-after-it-s-been-sent)\n\n...however \"Step 4. In the left-side menu, click \u2018Send\u2019, then choose \u2018Send offline\u2019.\", is not possible as 'Send Offline' doesn't actually appear anywhere.\n\nIn the mean time is it possible I can create new ETH transactions, or would the stuck transaction affect/prevent this new transaction also?\n\nThank you",
