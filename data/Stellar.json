Most of the long term holders never sold or made money, and the people with large holding that did sell created critical infrastructure that has made the network one of the only usable network at scale. \n\nTo put this into perspective. Samsung wants to create a tv that can display NFTs off the blockchain.  The way ETH works, you need scan the entire blockchain to determine what nft a wallet holds, and compute cost to constantly scan every block and see if any changes to the users nft collection appears will be huge.  So Samsung may do that for the TV as a service, but that\u2019s literally no different than a Facebook or Instagram feed.  \nWith stellar you could sign a wallet to display your wallet assets that are tagged with specific metadata. Pretty much every other nft capable blockchain like solana and cardano are in beta and likely won\u2019t work, because of the way they approached developing their core system.  You can look into turrets to get a better technical explanation on the benefits of performing compute and transactions on different layers.",

                    "response": "On Stellar (and any other Federated Byzantine Agreement network), the number of validators is not a direct measure of decentralization. By design, anyone who runs a validator chooses which other validators to trust, and those are the only validators they consult when deciding on whether to ratify a transaction set.\n\n\r  \nIf you have a million validators, and they all only trust the same single validator, for instance, the network is not at all decentralized.  If that validator fails, the network halts.  Two years ago, that's more or less how the network was configured: most validators exclusively trusted the SDF validators.  If those validators failed, the network halted.\n\n\r  \nFor the network to be decentralized, validators need to distribute trust across several other validators.  Right now, for instance, the majority of validators include 6 organizations in their circle of trust (aka their quorum set) in addition to SDF.  So 7 total.  Because the consensus protocol has a threshold of 5 out of 7 \u2014 in other words, for a validator to agree to ratify a set, 5 of those 7 organizations need to agree \u2014 it can, generally, tolerate the failure of multiple organizations before it halts.\n\n\r  \nRight now, SDF could turn off its validators, and the network would persist.\n\n  \nThere's a community blog post that raises a key point: \"A key observation is that the Stellar network has evolved towards decentralization by reshaping the nodes and trust decisions in 2019 and 2020.\"\r  \nhttps://medium.com/stellar-community/researching-the-mathematics-behind-the-stellar-consensus-protocol-342e974f97ed\r  \n\r  \nCould it be more decentralized?  Yes.  But it's in pretty good shape and new organizations can (and probably will) be added to the tier one validators.\n\n\r  \nUnlike proof of work and proof of stake networks, there is no financial incentive for running a Stellar validator.  Validators do not earn rewards.\n\n\r  \nThe incentives for running a validator are, essentially:\r  \nTo improve network health and decentralization\r  \nTo align your business with the Stellar brand\r  \nFor issuers, running a validator allows them to make it clear to customers that they will only honor transactions their validator ratifies.\n\n\r  \nAll of those choices are by design.  Unlike PoW and PoS networks, Stellar is designed to connect to the existing financial system, and validators are not anonymous, and they're generally not enthusiastic community members or mercenary organizations that profit off of their network participation.  Rather, validators are companies that offer real financial services built on Stellar, and they self identify, and other validators trust them because they know and trust the organizations that run them.  The network allows known entities to come together to keep a common ledger.",

                    "response": "Stellar is an interesting design in that there is one underlying decentralized platform on top of which somewhat independent/interconnected and more centralized entities can be created.\n\n\nIn a very short ELI5, you can think of XLM like an ocean. XLM connects everything, and anyone can jump in and swim freely (become a validator) if they want to. However, you can only use XLM in the way the platform is designed for it to be used, you have no control over it (i.e. it's decentralized). On top of this ocean it is also possible to create islands. These islands (custom tokens) are both connected to the ocean, but also separate from other islands. Islands can only communicate (trade/exchange) with other islands by sending boats (transactions) over the XLM ocean. The neat thing about islands though is that whoever creates them has total control over their token, including the ability to take them back from people (wallets) that they were given to. The fact that XLM itself is an open and decentralized medium of exchange means that the platform as a whole is decentralized and permission-less, but the ability to create new assets on top of the platform that are totally under your own control means that centralized entities like banks, companies and even yourself can tokenize your assets according to your own needs and without fear that someone might use your tokens in a way you don't approve of.\n\n\nThe most common use-case of Stellar is for banks/financial services to setup what are usually called \"Anchors\" and these typically create a token that is pegged to some fiat, like USDC is a coin pegged to the USD. USDC can be exchanged with other assets on the platform, allowing you to pay for things using that asset, but the issuer of USDC also has the power to take back tokens if you misuse their asset (e.g. stealing tokens, running scams, defrauding clients, etc). Anchors allow banks to easily switch between real USD and virtual USDC with the confidence that they have total control over their financial assets, and this is a very valuable feature for them.\n\n\nMore recent use-cases include rewards tokens (e.g. litemint.io CREDITs) and NFTs (e.g litemint.com NFT store).",

Got no response at all from these two. \n\nThe investments SDF has done over the past years have been made mainly in companies that don't benefit the ecosystem at all. These companies just take the money but they don't give back anything to the community. For example the Ethereum foundation invested in Uniswap, this was huge since it gave eth more use cases. But what has the stellar ecosystem gained with all the money invested lately? \n\nIt's clear by now that stellar has missed the DeFi train, but I still believe they have to invest in companies that can give back to the community and not just ones that are looking so selfishly to get profit.",

                    "response": "Short answer:Tokens are directly issued on the Stellar network from an account whereas the Ethereum network requires a smart contract to create a token. So it's easier and simpler to created a token on Stellar.\n\nMore details about Stellar Smart Contracts (warning incoming wall of text):\n\nStellar Smart Contracts (aka SSCs) combine transactions with various constraints to achieve an end result. Referencing the Stellar.org SSCs guide, the following are examples of constraints that can be combined to create SSCs:\n\nMultisignature \u2014 Multisig requires multiple parties to sign transactions on an account. You can also assign signature weights and thresholds.\n\nBatching / Atomicity \u2014 Batching is the concept of including multiple operations in a single transaction. Atomicity is the guarantee that given a series of operations, if one operation fails they all fail.\n\nSequence \u2014 Sequences are represented on Stellar via sequence numbers. Sequence numbers can be used to manipulate transactions and guarantee that certain transactions do not succeed if an alternative is submitted.\n\nTime bounds \u2014 Time bounds are limitations on the time period that a transaction is valid and can be used to represent time in a Stellar smart contract.\n\nThis short list of constraints means SSCs are limited in scope when compared to Ethereum smart contracts, but you can still come up with some creative use cases such as escrow contracts, joint entity crowdfunding, lightning channels, and more. You can also write them in the programming language of your choice \u2014 limiting the amount of errors and potential attacks.\n\nAnother key difference between SSCs and Ethereum smart contracts is that the conditions and logic of the smart contract are created separately from Stellar then submitted to the network as a transaction when the end conditions are met. As a participant in a Stellar smart contract you are not directly interacting with code on chain, but instead agreeing to the conditions of a transaction.\n\nFor example, say Alice wants to commission Bob for a piece of art. They come to an agreement that if Bob can finish the art piece in 30 days, Alice will pay him $100, but if it takes longer Alice only has to pay $70. Alice could then use a combination of an escrow account, multi-sig, and/or time-bounds to construct a transaction for both end conditions. Control of the escrow account could then be given to a trusted third party. Once the piece of art is finished, the transaction corresponding to the end condition (was it finished in 30 days or not) is submitted to the network by the trusted party. Bob receives his funds and Alice is only charged for the proper end condition.",

In this operating model, the malware is created by the ransomware developer, while the ransomware affiliate is responsible for infecting the target computer system and negotiating the ransom payment with the victim organisation. This new businessmodel has revolutionised ransomware, opening it up to those who do not have the technical capability to create malware, but are willing and able to infiltrate a target organisation.*\n\n...\n\n*Following the money*\n\n*Using Elliptic\u2019s blockchain analytics we can follow the ransom payments and see where the bitcoins are being spent or exchanged. What we find is that the majority of the funds are being sent to cryptoasset exchanges, where they can be swapped for other cryptoassets, or fiat currency.*\n\n*The majority of cryptoasset exchanges comply with anti money laundering regulations. They verify their customers\u2019 identity and report suspicious activity. They also use blockchain analytics tools such as those offered by Elliptic, to check customer deposits for links to illicit activity such as ransomware.*\n\n*However some jurisdictions do not enforce these regulations, and it is to exchanges in these locations that much of the DarkSide ransomware proceeds are being sent. Regulated cryptoasset businesses should perform careful due diligence on the virtual asset service providers (VASPs) that they transact with. Elliptic Discovery provides risk profiles of all major global VASPs - enabling you to to take a risk-based approach to your crypto counterparties.\"*",

                    "response": "Just gonna comment on the DEX piece:\n\nThe DEX is a really powerful tool that I think is often underappreciated. It is a single source of liquidity in the Stellar network, which has the potential to make the blockchain massively capital efficient. On Ethereum, liquidity is highly fragmented between various AMM protocols and DEX protocols. This lack of one central liquidity source results in worse pricing, and more arbitrage transaction spam. To be fair, this is a theoretical comparison; unfortunately, there isn't much liquidity on Stellar's DEX. Hopefully, this will change in the coming months when DeFi lending protocols like [YieldBlox](https://www.script3.io/ybx) and AMM proposals like [CAP-37/38](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0037.md) are implemented.\n\nFurthermore, the DEX is incredibly useful for financial protocols that need to create tradeable assets out of different financial instruments. We use this in our [options protocol](https://docs.optionblox.com/#/whitepaper). There are plenty of other use cases. What if you created an NFT index to solve NFT liquidity issues? You bundle many NFTs together and make them redeemable for an index token with an offer on the DEX. Then people can trade the index token and redeem it for the underlying NFTs at any point by filling the DEX offer. I'm just spitballing here. The bottom line is the DEX can be used pretty creatively for a variety of financial applications\n\nFinally, path payments are incredibly useful. You can read more about them here: [https://developers.stellar.org/docs/start/list-of-operations/#path-payment-strict-send](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/start/list-of-operations/#path-payment-strict-send) This kind of operation is extremely dependant on there being a DEX.",

It\u2019s always good to diversify in my opinion. However, at these levels in the short term Cardano has more risk to take on after the crazy bull run it has had. However if you are long term investing I think they are good hedge against Ethereum, and this goes for Polkadot as well.

That is because Btc has the first-player advantage, it is the \"Altavista/Excite/AOL\" of the year 2000-2002 dotcom era\", while some of the alts are like \"Google\", they are better but they are still unknown. I remember talking to people about Google and they would look at me like \"what?\" and they would rather keep using Yahoo, Aol... but then more and more shift to Google till there was a tipping point and Google quickly passed all the others and left them in the dust.\n\nAs more people get educated and discover the benefits of some of the alts, others will emerge as more useful and efficient than Bitcoin and the market cap will shift significantly towards some of the alts.\n\nHard to guess, but many like Stellar, Cardano, Nano, are well positioned to do what they have been designed for and therefore gain a big share of the market.\n\nAs far as investing, I would stay away from Btc. It is purely speculative at this point. It does very poorly what it was designed to do and is very inefficient. It is bad for climate as it uses a ton of energy and it is just a matter of time before the buzz around Btc bill change into people becoming more educated and open their eyes towards some of the alts.",

You can create a payment in Stellar that will automatically convert your sheep into wheat. It goes through the sheep/wheat orderbook and converts your sheep at the best available rate.\n\n>You can also make more complicated paths of asset conversion. Imagine that the sheep/wheat orderbook has a very large spread or is nonexistent. In this case, you might get a better rate if you first trade your sheep for brick and then sell that brick for wheat. So a potential path would be 2 hops: sheep->brick->wheat. This path would take you through the sheep/brick orderbook and then the brick/wheat orderbook.\n\n>These paths of asset conversion can contain up to 6 hops, but the whole payment is atomic\u2013it will either succeed or fail. The payment sender will never be left holding an unwanted asset.\n\n>This process of finding the best path of a payment is called pathfinding. Pathfinding involves looking at the current orderbooks and finding which series of conversions gives you the best rate. It is handled outside of Stellar Core by something like Horizon.\n\nhttps://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/exchange.html#cross-asset-payments",

                    "response": "Happy to address these, as I know it.  \n\n\n>Stellar Foundation holds ~60% of all XLM in existence, creating a central point of failure and strong degree of centralization risk for the project writ large\n\nI can understand why this is concerning to people, but you can read more about the Stellar mandate [here](https://www.stellar.org/foundation/mandate) on how those XLM will be used.  There is also some comfort (in my opinion) knowing that SDF is organized as a non-profit, so there are no founders/investors entitled to share of profits. \n\n\n>Network contains only ~35 validators which are heavily centralized around SDF nodes creating network-wide vulnerability\n\nActually, the list you link shows closer to 80.  I agree that it could still improve though! And 2019 was great in this regard.  Keep in mind also that unlike POW protocols, which require a lot of validators to decentralize the network, the total number of validators needed on Stellar is significantly lower.  \n\n\nSecond, I wouldn't put too much weight on those other articles, without going in to too much detail... they are just outdated.  As stated, \"the figure shows the structure of the quorum slices on January 22, 2019.\"  However, A LOT has changed over the last year, including major steps in decentralization.  Today, the network has decentralized away from SDF's validators, as recently discussed [here](https://www.stellar.org/blog/a-look-back-and-a-look-forward-for-2020/) by SDF in their year-end blog looking back on 2019 (\"This group of Tier 1 validators is mature enough at this point that we could turn off our nodes and the network would keep going!\") and recently [here] (https://stellar.expert/blog/stellarexpert-validators-quorum-set) by one of those Tier 1 validator operators (\"When the Stellar mainnet was deployed, most of the validators depended on the SDF quorum set, delegating voting power to SDF. Now it is a fully decentralized network.\")\n\n>Small team (~7) control the majority of the development work\n\nSDF is much larger than that... according Denelle's blog, which is linked above, \"SDF has grown fivefold [in 2019]- up from 11 to 56 employees.\"\n\n\n>No financial incentive (like a mining reward in the Bitcoin protocol) to become a node, which could lead to a dearth of nodes and node centralization\n\nIt's comparatively cheap to run a validator b/c of the significantly less energy that's needed, and while its true that there is no direct financial incentive (i.e. mining), there are incentives.  A business building on Stellar has major incentives to help secure the network that its business depends on, and compared to Bitcoin validators (whose only incentive is financial), these validators become much better partners.   Not to disparage the miners on Bitcoin, but the big ones have largely been anything but good partners.  In my opinion, due in full because of how the incentives work on POW protocols.\n\n>Questionable response by the Stellar team to disclose a bug that was discovered (and patched) in 2017\n\nIs this (below) the questionable response you're referring to?  This is what is given as their response in the link you provided.  I guess I fail to see what's questionable about that. \n\n\"We mentioned it twice, in fact, in the notes, and we were very clear the bug had been exploited. From there, we took the additional step of burning Lumens to \u201ctrue up\" the supply, so that current $XLM owners wouldn\u2019t be diluted and our projected total supply would remain accurate. We recognize that Stellar has since become significant financial software, and our disclosure standards have grown to reflect that reality. There\u2019s been no notable bug since, and if there were we would disclose it in full detail as soon as it was patched. As we announced last month in our 2019 Roadmap we have already committed to a full accounting of all of SDF\u2019s Lumens by the end of the year, and more details around this old bug were going to be (and still will be) part of that.\u201d",

I think the biggest thing that people are struggling with is that the SDF is different than Tron or XRP in regards to how they distribute their tokens. There is not any incentive to artificially pump XLM from their perspective, so the amount being held isn\u2019t as big of a deal as others. But keep in mind that they want to distribute the remaining into as many different hands as possible. They have taken steps in giveaways or airdrops to ensure that people aren\u2019t gaining an unfair advantage (Keybase airdrop for example was stopped all together because of that). \nIf you have followed the SDF closely for the past few years you would see that they are very careful with how they handle everything and that is very different than just about every other crypto out there period. They would rather their actions do the talking and that is very rare in this space",

So it's easier and simpler to created a token on Stellar.\n\nMore details about Stellar Smart Contracts (warning incoming wall of text):\n\nStellar Smart Contracts (aka SSCs) combine transactions with various constraints to achieve an end result. Referencing the Stellar.org SSCs guide, the following are examples of constraints that can be combined to create SSCs:\n\nMultisignature \u2014 Multisig requires multiple parties to sign transactions on an account. You can also assign signature weights and thresholds.\n\nBatching / Atomicity \u2014 Batching is the concept of including multiple operations in a single transaction. Atomicity is the guarantee that given a series of operations, if one operation fails they all fail.\n\nSequence \u2014 Sequences are represented on Stellar via sequence numbers. Sequence numbers can be used to manipulate transactions and guarantee that certain transactions do not succeed if an alternative is submitted.\n\nTime bounds \u2014 Time bounds are limitations on the time period that a transaction is valid and can be used to represent time in a Stellar smart contract.\n\nThis short list of constraints means SSCs are limited in scope when compared to Ethereum smart contracts, but you can still come up with some creative use cases such as escrow contracts, joint entity crowdfunding, lightning channels, and more. You can also write them in the programming language of your choice \u2014 limiting the amount of errors and potential attacks.\n\nAnother key difference between SSCs and Ethereum smart contracts is that the conditions and logic of the smart contract are created separately from Stellar then submitted to the network as a transaction when the end conditions are met. As a participant in a Stellar smart contract you are not directly interacting with code on chain, but instead agreeing to the conditions of a transaction.\n\nFor example, say Alice wants to commission Bob for a piece of art. They come to an agreement that if Bob can finish the art piece in 30 days, Alice will pay him $100, but if it takes longer Alice only has to pay $70. Alice could then use a combination of an escrow account, multi-sig, and/or time-bounds to construct a transaction for both end conditions. Control of the escrow account could then be given to a trusted third party. Once the piece of art is finished, the transaction corresponding to the end condition (was it finished in 30 days or not) is submitted to the network by the trusted party. Bob receives his funds and Alice is only charged for the proper end condition.",

How i see it is stellar wants to hit the jackpot of remitances and the global payments markets rather than making marketing campaigns for less significant aspects of the network. I would say its the builders/developers job to market the service built on the network rather than SDF itself. There's probably more to it, but I take the lack of marketing as a good thing since they do alot behind the scenes so its not all bad imo.

Stellars Cofounder, the man who built the consensus engine, is an award winning Stanford Professor with a PhD from MIT and BS from Harvard. Hes also co-director of Stanford Center for Blockchain Research which is sponsored by both Cardano and Ethereum. He should be the face of Stellar, yet hes completely unknown.\n\nGet out there on some platform/podcast and talk about Stellars properties. Talk about its reasoning for not being turing-complete. Talk about its minimally viable approach to enhancements. Talk about the state of blockchain research. Talk about the vision of Stellars next steps. The guy is a genius and extremely articulate.",

If you were to start a bloackchain project from 0 there is no reason to build on stellar unless you are building an anchor (which is a really hard thing to do). It's no accident that avax, solana and terra have gone up dramatically in past weeks. They have the low fees, fast transaction times and smart contracts.",

It can only be changed/deleted by me as I have the Secret Key so the Will can\u2019t be tampered with.\n\nHousing sales. The deeds, freehold documentation, energy certificates, property information etc etc can all be uploaded to a single directory and kept track of all in one file directory. Again no tampering can happen to the documents without the secret key access. Linked with a token you could legally do a house purchase over the Stellar Network with USDC, EURT or other assets enabling fast, legal, verifiable house sales all in one blockchain.\n\nCurrently there is next to no bloat on the network when using this method to upload to the network. As previously discussed in protocol discussions the transactions per second could be increased to allow for bloat if that were to ever happen. As it stands this method works very well without causing issues on the network.\n\nWith more testing and stress trials I believe this method could eventually be used for mp3 files and used like the same as methods above to give artists an immutable NFT of their music with documentation alongside it. \n\nThis is crypto and with any blockchain the initial use cases can differ to how a blockchain is used in the future. Yes stellar works great as financial rails and fast, low fee transactions but, just like when the World Wide Web came to existence, products evolve over time. Maybe this could be an evolution for the Stellar Network.",

Hype is a big mover in crypto, and image is everything. As more banks get into the game, I expect this to change since XLM/XRP really are an enhancement to existing banking infrastructure, but at the same time they do not give those institutions any more power than they already have and in the case of Stellar it does provide an alternative path to managing your money in a decentralized and more self-controlled manner, which makes it a winner for everyone.\n\n(4) Limited \"tokenomics\" for investors. The fact that ETH has moved to PoS makes it attractive for investors because of the ability to \"stake\" tokens. Stellar has no such mechanism, though there are other ways to gain interest on them like crypto banks (BlockFi, Nexo, Ledn, etc).",

I reached out to the dev that created that analytics blog post and he pointed me in the right direction.\n\nThe [https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/network-activity](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/network-activity) site gives an accurate representation of network activity. For the month of Feb, which had the highest txn volume to-date, there were roughly **28M total transactions.** This dashboard was spun up with the help of the stellar foundation, therefore I believe it to be the most accurate snapshot of network activity. \n\nThe other site, [https://www.statista.com/statistics/730838/number-of-daily-cryptocurrency-transactions-by-type/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/730838/number-of-daily-cryptocurrency-transactions-by-type/), which is the site I often see shared, only shows 5.4M transactions for Feb, and 1.3M for Ethereum network.\n\nNow, according to other sources for Ethereum stats, such as this one [https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/on-chain-metrics/ethereum](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/on-chain-metrics/ethereum), the Ethereum txn volume for Feb was actually \\~36M. \n\n**So, although 28M txn's from Stellar is impressive, it is less than Ethereum's volume of 36M.** The daily active addresses for Ethereum was 680k recently while Stellar was only 53k.\n\nAlso note, according to Stellar Expert, that 96% of all Stellar network volume comes from DEXs. And at the time of writing this, [doge-token.com](https://doge-token.com) is doing the most volume. The second DEX? Another doge token DEX. \n\nThe point of this post wasn't to point out Ethereum traffic, I simply wanted to understand how Stellar compared to Ethereum. Hope this was helpful for others too.",

It\u2019s always good to diversify in my opinion. However, at these levels in the short term Cardano has more risk to take on after the crazy bull run it has had. However if you are long term investing I think they are good hedge against Ethereum, and this goes for Polkadot as well. I hold all three, as I think all three will find room in this giant market space. \n\nAlways remember to do your own research.",

The market cap is what is important because that's what determines the % change in value of the coin. If the the market cap increases 50% then your investment in XLM just went up 50%.

Stellar should distribute those uncirculated coins to XLM holders or burn them out of existence.

I went to send it to my hardware wallet and they wanted HALF my bitcoin as a fee to send it! I thought about it and checked to see if that exchange supported XLM, it did!

Instead of a $100+ transaction charge, it would be a fraction of that, with 100% of fees going to those staking Defi tokens on Stellar. Thus, eliminating the excess part of the charge being received by the ETH miners.

You can also swap BTC on Stellar into any other currency without intermediary at the best rate available on the network.

Stellar\u2019s main goal is to basically have every consumer especially in areas that have no access to banks(such as areas of Africa) with the ability to send and receive money anywhere in the world. \n\nTheir network is far far far faster than many blockchain and the transactions are essentially free since the cost of a move is .000001 lumens or something like that. \n\nThe transactions are actually done in lumens which means the token is always being used unlike ripple for example in which banks just use the network but don\u2019t need the token. \n\nThey\u2019re a non-profit who has a world class team so you know that they\u2019re actually trying to bring a product for the world and not just money. \n\nTheir are also applications built on top of their platform such as DSTOQ which is an investment brokerage app built on stellar so that\u2019s more than just moving fiat from one location. \n\nAside from that they have great partnerships with corporations like IBM. \n\nThey\u2019re a far more about them and their network to show why their utility is different but you can research that in places like cointelegraph as a good source :)",

This fee is there to stop everyone from abusing the service, we don't really make money out of it at the moment.\n\n\\- Showing withdrawal fees during deposit process - is a hard thing, you might confuse more people than you help. And eventually it's a wallet responsibility to make it user-friendly. Anchor is there for secure custody of funds.\n\nHowever current SEP6 standard has been deprecated and we will look into switching to interactive flow eventually for both deposits and withdrawals and then we will have more control on what users see when they deposit.",

I think a big part of it is because Stellar has never invested in the type of marketing and hype machine the way some others have. If you compare Stellar and XRP for example, they are very similar and you can argue that Stellar\u2019s future is looking brighter as it\u2019s now working with banks as well as remittance companies. Why hasn\u2019t the market discovered it yet? Why isn\u2019t there an army of Stellar fans on the XRP or BTC subs doing a comparison and questioning all of their limitations, the way they do on the Stellar sub? I honestly feel like some the XRP shilling done here is coordinated if not actually paid. Those kinds of efforts can effect public perception and enthusiasm. Efforts on other social platforms and advertising based marketing could help as well.",

DEX markets only work for fungible assets; an orderbook for houses doesn't make sense as houses are of vastly different values. Or god forbid a market for birth certificates! Markets for things that come in fungible non-fractional quantities, like liters of milk, are fine, but those aren't NFTs; they're indivisible assets. The protocols for indivisible assets shouldn't be the same as for non-fungible assets.\n\n**NFTs on the protocol level:**\n\n* For a protocol level implementation, some of proposed advantages have problems:\n   * Trading on the DEX: same problem as using standard assets.\n   * Guaranteed wallet support could be bad. Different classes of NF assets have vastly different contract, regulatory, and transfer-ability needs; a standard interface won't match across classes.\n   * Horizon queries might not make sense for this; the necessary data points for a particular asset class would need customized queries, which would lead to endpoint bloat. Non-coverage problems could be even worse.\n* A protocol level implementation would not be able to anticipate every class of NFTs and their needs, so issuers would likely need to hack the closest supported asset class to get what they need.\n* Overall, I think this isn't a good investment of protocol development resources, especially as it would require very careful protocol-adjacent work for legal needs, etc. See all the work Smartlands has had to do for tokenized securities, and those are fungible.\n* Just thinking about the host of SDK objects for all the different NFT classes makes me shudder.\n* All that said, a CAP could be designed in a totally different way, so some of these problems could be removed.\n\n**NFTs on the SEP level, and particularly as accounts:**\n\n* The flexibility of the SEP level is a good fit here. NTFs would need an accepted general framework but customization in detail; SEPs do that without the locking-in of features that CAPs require.\n* Accounts are designed for ownership customization via the signer features.\n* Ownership of an NFT should be negotiated off-chain, with the current owners able to lock transfer until, for example, a contract is finalized. Holding of signer private keys gives that functionality.\n* Inability to trade on the DEX is a feature we should want, as above.\n* Off-chain metadata has to be a thing for NTFs regardless of implementation. Where is the house, and what are its characteristics? What is the provenance of the art? What are the legal requirements for ownership of whatever it is? Any number of other data types that I haven't thought of?\n\n&#x200B;",

                    "response": "I'd like to clarify a few things.\n\n**\"Who needs NFTs?\"**\n\nPeople were asking many times about ERC-721 support (more than 20 times as far as I remember). Developers discussed several different approaches, Johan Sten even built a simple framework for NFTs. Some apps have been trying to emulate those tokens. But major wallets do not support those tokens, and they are incompatible with each other. NFT-based games already strive on Ethereum (check the gameplay of \"Gods Unchained\"), Tron even establish a special $100M fund for game developers.I'm personally ok to live without NFTs; I just summed up requests and implementation proposals that have been around for more than a year already.\n\n**There is a huge difference between CAP and SEP process.**\n\n\\- CAP requires significant codebase changes. Everything that is supported on the protocol level requires changing Stellar Core, Horizon, SDKs, documentation, etc. Usually, it's a tremendous amount of work.\n\n\\- SEP is the ecosystem application interopability standard. For example, company A issues new NFT tokens, and they are already compatible with wallet B, and exchange C. SDF does not have to modify a single line of code in Stellar Core to make it work. It's up to application developers to implement it or not. As I mentioned, most wallets do not fully support SEP-0001 (stellar.toml file), and still can safely operate without it.\n\n**Lastly, about the prioritization and implementation.**\n\nI'll prepare all the required documentation and bring this topic to the mailing list and protocol discussion (if the community votes for it). In the case of SEP proposal, the standard may be accepted after a few iterations of discussions on the mailing list and a protocol meeting, so potentially we may have it ready in a month or two.\n\nIn case of CAP, final implementation will likely take more than a year, as there are many high-priority features around.\n\nAs Johan Sten said, not everything has to be initiated by SDF. The community may decide whether some features are important or not. That's the whole point of decentralization.",

Obviously, one of the first places to look is at the [GitHub](https://github.com/stellar) activity. On [Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/stellar.public), active stellar-core development discussion occurs daily in the #core channel and it's been encouraging to see the recent growth in activity across the platform in general. More [clusters](https://www.stellar.org/community/clusters/) are popping up all over and upcoming cluster events will be shared in the newsletter next week (if you're interested in organizing a Cluster, [use this form](https://stellarform.typeform.com/to/g2Ah9P)).

Some information has already been updated on the website [here](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe've also updated team and governance pages and have a fancy new little [nonprofit status page](https://stellar.org/about/nonprofit-status) that will have a permanent home in the future. Jed [mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/akup8k/sdf_update/) in the comments of [his last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/akup8k/sdf_update/ef8bljl), that he plans to start having AMAs. We're currently working on getting a cadence for that set up and I personally think that engagement will be really beneficial. Reddit is a large community hub but it definitely misses helping inform people using other channels. Expanding the visibility of these AMAs is also important.\n\nOutside of this, there's new resources and guides coming this year that we know will help bridge that gap between STELLAR OVERVIEW and DOCUMENTATION.  We also want to highlight the work that's happening in the ecosystem. Stellar is the whole of people using it! The big goal is making sure we can direct people to the right places for the right information. So while we're setting up the framework now, the end result will be having consistent communication to help people all over find the answers to the questions they're looking for.\n\n&#x200B;",

One of the things I hope comes from the upcoming community fund are commissioned technical one pagers and road maps for accomplishing these types of STOs in different regulatory environments to promote the types of micro and macro economies you talk about here. To know the hoops smartlands have gone through would huge. There needs to be no ambiguity or obscurity for people to feel comfortable doing things like this, and I would think it should be straight forward. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly I hope most of the community fund can go to smoothing out the potholes and PR since the road you've laid out here has a pretty clear with a super exciting finish line.

Simply put, it\u2019s too easy to use. Without some nominal barrier or cost, the ledger could become filled with spam or nonsense, or used as a kind of arbitrary database system. These outcomes would defeat the intent behind Stellar: to be a fast, efficient payments system.  \n>  \n>To solve this, we needed to introduce just the slightest bit of friction to deter bad or frivolous actors. Imposing a minimum balance on each account and a very small per-transaction fee were chosen as these deterrent costs. Right now, the minimum balance is 1 lumen and the minimum per-transaction fee is 0.00001 lumen. These are small enough to keep Stellar widely accessible, but big enough to discourage large-scale bad behavior.  \n>  \n>Since Stellar is a universal system for digital money, we could\u2019ve allowed people to pay these costs in dollars, pesos, yuan or anything else. But we felt none of these were appropriate. First, we didn\u2019t want the network to \u201cprefer\u201d any particular national currency\u2014if Stellar used dollars, say, then network prices would stay fixed for Americans but float for everyone else. And, even more, we wanted to create a digital-first asset that embraces the openness of the internet and is independent of economic and political factors.  \n>  \n>So we gave the network its own currency, intended solely for denominating network requirements. That currency is \u201cthe lumen.\u201d As you can see below, there are now 4.3 million Stellar accounts (insertion: currently 6.8 million per stellar.expert), and each of them uses lumens to meet minimum balance requirements and pay transactions fees.  \n>  \n>A natural, pleasant, byproduct of having a network token is that it eases the movement of money between users. Because everyone has and needs lumens, lumens can always be a medium of exchange between otherwise illiquid assets.",

The network went offline, the codebase was thrown out, the consensus was thrown out and Jed, David, and others, built an entirely new chain from the ground up.\n\nWhat's even more funny is that many of the chains built today (almost all of them) are literal forks of the EVM and existing consensus mechanisms, yet none are forever called forks.\n\nStellar is legitimately one of the few blockchains that created its own consensus and codebase from the ground-up.\n\n[End rant]",

Since, she has appeared multiple times speaking with Treasury officials and they have echoed each other when speaking.\n\n-XLM aims to bring finance to the unbanked. This aligns with governmental interests. Also, the SDF is not for profit. Their chief competitor, Ripple, is for profit and is currently being sued by the government whom has framed Ripple as a greedy organization\n\n-The US Government does not do business with entities that the SEC sued. \n\n-XLM is faster, less expensive, and has more features than its competitors and is ISO20022 compliant. Also, presently, Stellar performs more L1 transactions than every other crypto combined. \n\n-XLM runs IBM\u2019s Worldwire\n\n-XLM\u2019s grab back feature is one of a kind and has been described a \u201ca must have\u201d for a digital dollar by lawmakers. \n\n-Stellar tests their integrity every year in a \u201chackathon.\u201d \n\n-XLM is truely decentralized. Last year, during the hackathon, North American nodes all dropped for several hours. The network stayed up. Afterwards, a patch was created and protocol implemented within days with a unanimous vote. \n\n-XLM is an American invention",

If SDF does not plan to market to end users and are only focusing on organizations that are building project using stellar then why does SDF directly sell XLM on exchanges?  Speculators buy these tokens on exchanges and what can they do with XLM in their real life for now? \n\nAs one of the members posted on the daily chat yesterday \n\n\"They created XLM, a thing with value, out of nothing. It therefore represents debt which it sells to people to fund the SDF, but it is bought with the idea that it is an investment. You can't say \"who knows why people buy it,\" but then go selling to fund operations and think you don't owe anyone anything. I support the mission, the tech, the ideals of SDF, but it's not a charity.\r  \nI do believe use will create value, but anything unnecessary that hurts price, or anything else that can grow the net worth of the project and therefore grow interest, awareness, etc should be pursued as well.\n\nAlso selling millions of tokens and keeping price down, or doing other things that negatively impact the value, works against their mandate of supporting the growth and development of the network. Hindering those intangible things you get with a valuable network sets Stellar further and further behind an ever more competitive market.\"\n\nI know SDF members cannot and should not talk about price and other speculation but we would really like insights into the exchange sells .\n\nAlso am not sure if we can request more info on what happened with existing acquisitions like chain? and so many other investments made by SDF in lot of businesses?  Are they working? what is the roadmap ?",

This question also gets asked almost every other week so I think having this post up and answered in detail would help search engines. \n\nWe were the second subreddit to trial the \"community points\" project spearheaded by Reddit throughout 2019 (it started at the end of 2018). The moderator b1tcc took the initiative to help create the application that would be used for the community points project on r/Stellar (b1tcc was not shy from making projects for the community, as he previously took the initiative to create the first free inflation pool service [Lumenaut pool] in the community, which was a huge success given how small the project started; he even was the first one who coined the name 'Lumenaut'). \n\nIf you don't know what community points is, it's basically a points system devoted to subreddits which enable the community to earn points, be interactive with them, create polls with weighted points (meaning the more points the more your voting power matters), and even govern the subreddit in its entirety. \n\nWhat many people are not aware of (or maybe they're not supposed to know), is that Reddit was actually trying to trial the blockchains to see which one was the best suit for their application case. Having faster transactions and low fees is huge for a utility case like this, however, in the end the numbers make sense and if you actually look at the numbers what you see is almost 10 ethereum developers for every 1 stellar developer. If a team of developers pick one blockchain, they're not going to stop halfway just to pick another one (unless they work for the Kin Foundation).\n\nThe decision to use Ethereum didn't suit well for r/Stellar as r/Stellar can't necessarily start using the Ethereum blockchain, for obvious reasons. The pressure to continue the project for the Stellar community was mounting for b1tcc as there wasn't really anyone 'supporting' b1tcc in the end, everyone just expected him to work for free. \n\nThis is just me speculating here but I believe b1tcc saw a huge potential opportunity for Stellar to be used by Reddit and tried their best to get Reddit to use Stellar, but in the end the decision was made in favor of Ethereum. After almost spending 3 years on the subreddit I don't believe b1tcc's leave was 'abrupt'. Obviously they deleted their Reddit account and they didn't a make a \"good bye post\", but it was very clear that the moderator was trying to leave their post as a mod months beforehand (less activity etc), as it was almost 3 years of unpaid volunteer work and what I would describe as a phenomenal act of civil service which will never be forgotten by thousands of Lumenauts they inspired.\n\nThere could be many factors as to why it stopped but to keep the speculation realistic, the end reason was building on the Ethereum blockchain as it was was more lucrative (for every Stellar fan, you have 10 Ethereum fans), and not many people knew Stellar before they already knew Ethereum.\n\nIf you were a developer and you had to pick one project to build on, would you pick the one which has faster transactions and lower fees? Or the one that has 10x more people/money?",

And what if I uploaded files there and your site disappeared, the files would still be stored 'forever' but I'd no longer be able to figure out how to download them. How about making this an Open Source project instead with a command line tool?",

But the way the tool is built I can't see a lot of people using it. It's a proprietary, centralized piece that may disappear any time (you forget to pay your Godaddy bill, you suddenly think it's no longer worth maintaining because nobody uses it etc) so instead just make it an open, distributed tool that people can use offline, on their own machines and see what happens.",

It can only be changed/deleted by me as I have the Secret Key so the Will can\u2019t be tampered with.\n\nHousing sales. The deeds, freehold documentation, energy certificates, property information etc etc can all be uploaded to a single directory and kept track of all in one file directory. Again no tampering can happen to the documents without the secret key access. Linked with a token you could legally do a house purchase over the Stellar Network with USDC, EURT or other assets enabling fast, legal, verifiable house sales all in one blockchain.\n\nCurrently there is next to no bloat on the network when using this method to upload to the network. As previously discussed in protocol discussions the transactions per second could be increased to allow for bloat if that were to ever happen. As it stands this method works very well without causing issues on the network.\n\nWith more testing and stress trials I believe this method could eventually be used for mp3 files and used like the same as methods above to give artists an immutable NFT of their music with documentation alongside it. \n\nThis is crypto and with any blockchain the initial use cases can differ to how a blockchain is used in the future. Yes stellar works great as financial rails and fast, low fee transactions but, just like when the World Wide Web came to existence, products evolve over time. Maybe this could be an evolution for the Stellar Network.",

It is easy to integrate as well on your website and you can just show them the QR code when they pay you. Do remind them of the MEMO when they pay you lumens.\n\nThey have an in-built tax tool too to track your taxes.\n\nIf you want a Stellar wallet mainly for accepting lumens, use Lobstr. You can then convert your XLM to USDC on the app (to avoid extreme price fluctuations) or keep it in XLM for future appreciation :)",

                    "response": "One barrier here for the use case you mention is that you can't directly exchange for another crypto, rather you're exchanging for an asset that has been tokenized onto the stellar network. You then need a third party off ramp (anchor) that you trust to exchange that tokenized asset for the real asset, and vice versa to get fiat onto the network for example. Another barrier is liquidity, without enough volume being exchanged on the SDEX you get a widened spread between bid and ask - so even though the cost of the transaction is negligible the spread may mean you can't buy or sell at the current market price. \n\nIn terms of major cryptocurrencies being added it just needs issuers issuing tokens representing those cryptocurrencies and creating some liquidity around them, note quite a few of the major ones are already on there: BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP. Imo getting some lesser known cryptocurrencies that are pushing to get onto more exchanges could be good a way to expose people to the SDEX - for example I was looking for a quick and easy way to obtain banano recently, if it was tokenized on stellar I would definitely have been using that.\n\nI reckon in the future we will see heavier use of DEXs, just need the anchors and liquidity. Last thing I didn't really mention was marketability and ease of use, everyone knows of Coinbase and if someone is looking for exchanging their bitcoin to ether for example they're not going to be thinking of using something that heavily mentions another crypto (e.g. stellarx). I'd imagine we'd see at some point a company that looks like an exchange but is a pretty UI on top of a DEX + a bunch of anchors",

By now it has not been possible for me to take them out of Solar Wallet using the out of the box functionalities without recurring to an exchange. I got stuck after the KYC procedure requested by eurt anchor during the withdrawal phase, i passed the verification step but nothing happened, probably some redirect did not work as planned or the anchor I chose is not active anymore.\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll try again with another wallet like lobstr later on today.",

Shortly after the initial fork, it was decided that too much needed to be changed to create the network that Jed envisioned(i.e. how he had hoped that the ripple network would turn out), and so the early XRP fork was migrated to a brand new blockchain and consensus protocol, the stellar blockchain and the stellar consensus protocol, federated byzantine agreement.

It is their \"Current Supply\" measurement, which they define as the sum of all units visible on the ledger. Specifically, that does include \"burned\" units, at least in all cases I am familiar with. We have discussed adding adjusted supply metrics here. It's something we're considering and I believe such a metric would reflect the impact of the XLM event you referenced in your email.\"",

I've spent some time to inform myself as good and as independently as I can about the SEC case, and I believe and hope, for the sake of all crypto, that XRP will not be a security.

XLM went to .24 during the same pump (from .08) and is now at .125xx which is still a bit under a 2x increase in value over a 2 mo. period. not sure why 90% of posts on this sub became whiny \"xrp vs xlm, this sucks, xlm won't go up\" type posts, but it's super frustrating - esp. when people inaccurately state xlm's performance as if they weren't even in this space 2 months ago when xlm was worth < .09 cents. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot saying your comment is as bad as a lot of the whining is, but just dropping my 2 cents here. I regularly comment on these types of posts to point out the current price relation to price just a month or two ago (much higher, despite the pullback and XRP FUD). These posts are always upvoted a bunch, and then, after pointing out the inaccuracies of the whiny posts, other users chime in to affirm my refuting of the facts regarding price movement, both for XLM in isolation, and w/ respect to XRP. IMO XRP related talk should just end, as it's not productive, we're not a security, the tech is different, and it just perpetuates confusion and a continuing cycle of \"XRP is dragging us down\" type comments\n\n&#x200B;\n\ndo with you the best in all of your trading, etc. don't take this comment personally",

The Stellar Development Foundation is a non-profit and the price point of their native token actually has little bearing on the success of the project overall. All that said, I am holding XLM because I find the arguments compelling regarding widespread adoption and eventual price gains. Stellar is well on its way to fulfilling the mission of being the global payment standard. It's working well and closely with governments, international finance orgs, etc. It has the right tech, the right approach to regulation, and most importantly (to me) an ethical commitment to providing low-cost and easy access to financial services with an open-source, decentralized solution. \n\nIt's looking like a slow burn, but as adoption increases so will price and those who decided to speculate on XLM are going to be happy they did so, IMHO.",

I\u00b4m scared as well but I just look at the way it is. If there is no trading for Xrp on the biggest exchanges there is no competitor for Stellar. Stellar is already used way more than Xrp. Lots of people used Xrp for going fast from one exchange to another, now there is just Stellar. When I read stuff like \"leave the sinking ship\" I just think leave the crypto which is most used out of all 2000+ currencies? So just keep calm and think about it.",

Thus allowing partners to immediately dump on the market.\n* Ripple avoids visibility into the above practices.\n\nCompare to SDF:\n\n* No ICO, but has a large printed supply in escrow to fund their organization.\n* Spending funds to developing the network utilization projects/enhance the network. Everything developed leads to token utilization on the network/requires token to utilize.\n* Lack of large scale payouts to the founders\n* SDF does not talk about price and price of token doesn't matter to them. People get angry that they don't talk about price/pump it but it's for a very good reason.\n* SDF provides monetary grants to secure utilization/future network development, but typically in escrowed accounts.\n* SDF provides full accounting visibility to their respective wallets.\n\nTL;DR: SDF has the large printed supply in escrow being used to fund their organization which is a potential vulnerability for regulation, but the XRP lawsuit is a very specific targetted lawsuit towards ripple due to a pattern of sketchy behavior. The main difference i'd highlight is using proceeds from the token to develop solutions that don't require the token, and then making profits from selling those solutions. There is also an aspect that ripple knowingly did the above practices for years after knowing about the potential SEC oriented ramifications.",

That quote out of WB says it all. The allegation paper clearly maps out how the markets are grossly manipulated when they can be and I would be very surprised if Ripple doesn't eventually implode over this. ?Coinbase has almost no choice but to delist XRP to move their IPO forward. We have seen how, but for unknown reasons, that XLM tokens are priced in a tether like fashion to Ripple tokens. What will happen when XRP finally blows up? I give that a probability about 95%, but these things die slowly. Does anyone know who the  \"Market Maker\" is in the complaint?\n\nTime to decouple.\n\nOver the years, the Stellar Development Foundation keeps pointing the ship and has done a fantastic job in the choppy waters. Now the ship is about to cross a use case tipping point just as another lead boat broke a mast. More uncertain choppy water ahead, unfortunately, but I have confidence this is a very positive Christmas present 2020.\n\nHappy Holidays!",

If individuals purchased XRP \u201cto engage in speculative investment trading\u201d or if Ripple employees promoted XRP as potentially increasing in price, the Legal Memos warned that Ripple would face an increased risk that XRP units would be considered investment contracts (and thus securities).**\n\n\nStellar is not Ripple",

The altcoin show began 3-5 months later when BTC was going to double the previous ATH. XLM had a run from 0.001 to 0.06 USD and XRP from 0.006 to 0.06 and a few weeks later from 0.06 to 0.45 USD. I know history does not have to be an indicator what is going to happen, but it can be. But it is really obvious that BTC did the same move like the last two halvings. It\u00b4s funny that BTC at 24000 USD is still under the radar for mainstream media while in 2017 it was hype everywhere. We have to wait until it hits 30-50K and the mainstream media starts to bring in the retail investors again.",

BTC is fueled by USDT printing, USDT is not backed by USD but backed by BTC for the most part. Print USDT to buy BTC therefore increasing their reserves allowing for more USDT to be printed and still give the illusion that USDT is backed. Just ask yourself what happens when there is a rush to cash out by selling your BTC knowing that USDT also needs to sell BTC for you to be able to redeem in USD. This is a terrifying cycle and regulations need to come. BTC current price is not a reflection of the market but a reflection of fraud and manipulation. I don\u2019t know what the future will hold but something needs to be done so that real utility can shine.",

As you can imagine, it\u2019s already this SEC FUD traveled around Japanese crypto markets.\nXRP has already been the markets in Japan for a long time but XLM has just become known in Japan, and there is little information in Japanese. Because of this, it\u2019s easy to relate this XRP issue to XLM for them. I really wish there was a Japanese official information site where they could go to clearly find out the difference between XLM and XRP on this issue for them. \n\n\n\n\nAnd let me end here with a positive news for XLM:\n\n\nGMO Coin (a crypto exchange in Japan) announced that it will start the \"Tsumitate Cryptocurrency Assets\" service. What does it mean is that roughly speaking, you can automatically purchase a fixed amount of crypto assets on a fixed day every month. The service starts on 2021-01-10 and XLM is also supported on the first day.\n\n\n** A little detail: \nWith this monthly auto reserve purchase plan, you can set from a minimum of 1000 JPY to a maximum of 50,000 JPY. So, you can think, super roughly, $10 to $500 range in USD.\n\n\n\u201cTumitate\u201d is definately good for long term investors. (..hopefully)\n\n\nLive Long and Prosper Lumenauts\ud83d\udd96",

Had plans to take some into BTC or USD if we moved further up into solid mid .20's\n\nNot going to add to the slew of other comments expressing FUD, disappointment, and unrealized losses, b/c that's not my prerogative\n\nWon't try to predict the future but would be pleased, and not totally surprised if we saw some sort of bounce soon. If this wen't under .10 I'd transfer more fiat.\n\nWhat was stupid was throwing some additional chunks of fiat in around .17 despite my very low average cost, feeling that XLM was in fact undervalued within the context of coinbase XLM cash back, likely paypal support, and its general utility, usec ase, and legitimate partnerships.\n\n**In short, if you're new to crypto / alt coins and hopped on XLM recently for one reason or another (be it a well-informed choice or attempting to make quick gains on \"XRP\" #2 - which XLM couldn't be further from actually being - I'd recommend sitting on your hands for a few days instead of selling at a loss and getting potentially left in the dust.**\n\n**There's a lot of forces at play currently in the market, and a greater (localized) # of reasons to be optimistic about XLM.**\n\nHell, even as a basic mechanism of exchange, the speed with which I transferred the bulk of my XLM to a hardware wallet (compared to BTC and even LTC, which I feel is a solid and practically useful crypto - compared to BTC - cannot be beat)\n\nI'm still a few K in the green, so not losing any sleep\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust my 2 cents, good luck all and try to not let emotion and unrealized losses distort your ability to reason and hold out for the *medium* term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit: final thought, looking at the CBpro orderbook scroll right now, can't help but feel sort of bad for those who are still unloading sums > 10K xlm in sells, doesn't seem like a prudent time (after a whole day of rapid dumping) to do so but hopefully I don't eat these words**",

Don't be that \"Jack\". The algorithms are programmed to separate you from your stack.\n\nDo your own research, think for yourself, buy something that has real-world application, and hold that bitch until it peaks in 2022. At times, XLM may not seem like it's going up as much as the others, but it will outperform most of the 1000's of other vaporware being promoted. Be patient and you will be nicely rewarded.

They all seem kinda fishy to me too except for AnchorUSD which is based in the USA.\n\nRight now I am only using AnchorUSD (USD is 7.83% interest) .. Abra offers 10% interest along with the others and they offer higher XLM interest compared to anchorUSD\u2019s 2.79% XLM interest but I just think AnchorUSD is the most trusted of the 4 and I\u2019m only using them.

Abra *earns* interest daily but pays it out weekly. \n\n* AnchorUSD doesn't require moving funds from a trading account to an interest earning account. You just turn on the interest earning option. Abra requires you to move your money into the interest earning account and states that it can take days to move out if you're looking to make a trade. \n\n* Both have a spread when buying/selling. In my experience, AnchorUSD tends to be cheaper. AnchorUSDs spread is almost always around 1.5%, Abras tends to fluctuate above 2%\n\n* Abra provides a bit higher interest (as mentioned) for both US stablecoins and crypto.\n\n* Abra has much higher adoption and is used by many more people. The biggest risk for applications/ business that borrow and lend customer funds is a \"run on the bank\". This essentially happens if too many people try to withdraw funds at the same time and the 'bank' doesn't have enough liquid deposits to fund the orders. This risk is reduced by number of customers/deposits. Abra would have far less risk in this sense.\n\n* Both provide FDIC insurance up to $250k of **non**-interest bear deposits and both offer private insurance on the interest-bearing deposits. The insurance only covers 'hacks' against the companies, if someone hacks your individual account that's on you.",

If this is the case, you can enter any memo such as \"1234\" with the address and it will work.  AnchorUSD XLM deposit addresses are unique to your account.",

                    "response": "I just tested it out. Solar and Lobstr Wallet read muxed addresses. But TrustWallet does not. TrustWallet is a terrible wallet for XLM. It doesn't even read federation addresses. But theoretically the same could be accomplished with federation addresses. Wirex for example gives you a federation address which auto locks memo. (I only recently found out, I never knew this  was even possible before Wirex...) But most other exchanges have not bothered (must be too much of a mystery and a chore). Anyway, I know that I could easily set up a system based on muxed addresses for a small business. It's really only a few extra lines of programming than the standard memo operation and you don't need a domain. Basically anyone can do it. That's why I can see this taking off, since it's much more intuitive.\n\nBut yes, these things are all just preparing Stellar for mass adoption. Having payments go wrong because of some wrongly filled in memo slows everything down. People will think XLM sucks because they always need to fill an extra field as opposed to other coins. It should be one scan and go. All this will depend on good wallets as well. Rabet (close ties with Lumenswap) is making a new mobile wallet. They already made the best web extension wallet for Stellar. I have high hopes for this team. I hope it will be something like Natrium for Nano. I honestly have no idea why the Stellar Foundation hasn't tried to make their own wallet. Maybe they thought LOBSTR was good enough... First of all, LOBSTR stores your key on server. That's already a red flag. A personal wallet should never upload your keys, no matter how secure they claim to be.",

I always liked the cartoon rocket, and the old stellar website had a friendly feel to it.\n\nThe new logo turned out great, though. It also reminds me of the first image of a black hole, which iirc happened around the same time, and I've wondered if that was a coincidence or somewhat intentional. \n\nAnother thing I've been curious about was the stellar.org redesign. The old theme matched the cartoon rocket, was briefly replaced with a more modern theme, and then suddenly that also was replaced with the awesome space-based theme we have today.\n\nIn any case, thanks for these, /u/spintax_. It's interesting to think about how far Stellar has come and where it's going in the future. I always felt Stellar and the SDF had a real shot at changing the world.",

From what I can see online Celsius does not charge fees on transfers.  \nYour tax question will depend on where you live. Generally taxes are paid on income and on some purchases. Theoretically your income is not reduced every time you spend money, so paying a fee is not technically a loss. Conversely, the collection of fees constitutes income generated by a financial institution, who would pay a business income tax on the aggregate sum they collect. You should only need to pay taxes on your crypto when you sell your crypto into a national currency and this sale generates either a gain or a loss of income.",

Stellarport is just an interface to the stellar exchange WHICH IS BUILT INTO STELLAR.\n\nYou're literally posting about something you clearly know NOTHING about.\nAs for the OP:Your private key was clearly stolen. My guess is you used the wrong fake website which took your private key(this is how most private keys are stollen from Stellar users). If not then some other means were used to take your key. \n\nTo anyone incapable of checking what websites they use: SET UP TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION.\nI would suggest setting that up in any case. Everyone should be doing it. \nUse Stellar Guard(supporter by Lobster Vault and even StellarPort) or Stellar Vault. That way even if your private key is stolen they can't do anything with it.\n\nAs for halfwits posting about exchanges and lobstr...lobstr uses the same exchange as StellarPort as it is ALSO just an interface. And unlike StellarPort if you've created an account with them 2+ years ago, they actually have your private key...encrypted..on THEIR SERVERS. \nSo advocating for a different UI instead of advocating for some personal responsibility when handling private keys is pretty much stupid. You're still putting trust into someone else when in reality you need to bump up your security by requiring a third party service to additionally sign a your transactions.\nEven if you use Lobstr(I use and trust them as well). You never know when any of these services and interfaces might be hacked and compromised.",

Paypal has a special merchant account that costs actual money and they take a cut of every transaction. I've heard stories of people trying to run business through personal accounts and having their accounts locked until they sign up for merchant accounts. And if that merchant wants to receive a USD stablecoin without all the fees, they have only a few options.\n\nFocusing on the convenience you already enjoy via Venmo and whatever emphasizes that maybe you aren't the target demographic at this time. You might as well say you don't understand the purpose of crutches because you have functioning legs. (Not a dig, just a silly, extreme example). Stellar has a purpose, but it's just not one you need with your present circumstances.\n\nBut as for physical locations, yes, they are lacking.  At this time, they are trying to support and enhance existing infrastructure and provide the tools for startups to enter the space...not necessarily build their own infrastructure yet or even interface directly to customers like you and me.  So at this time, it looks like stablecoins that interface with ACH/wire with traditional banks...but there are movements for more user-facing products...such as the leaked info about the possible Moneygram acquisition...or Velo Labs potentially using 7/11s as an on/off-ramp. I believe Tempo has physical locations, too, in Europe.\n\nEdit: Also, with regards to your Mexico example\n\n[https://www.stellar.org/case-studies/saldo](https://www.stellar.org/case-studies/saldo)\n\n>Using Saldo\u2019s interface, a sender selects a recipient\u2019s utility provider and account, chooses the amount they want to pay, and hits send  \n>  \n>With a click of the button on the app, people can instantly pay their utilities bills. Family members no longer have to take the extra step of going to a remittance provider in-person to receive the money for their bills.  \n\n\n[https://saldo.mx/index\\_en.html](https://saldo.mx/index_en.html)",

While not the spirit of crypto, if you use a mainstream-enough exchange and don't think you'll be doing anything suspicious, it's probably the safest thing for most crypto noobies.\n\nCreate paper wallets. Using a clean device, generate a new public/private key pair (preferably using an offline version of the site or whatever). Send your stuff to it. Use a blockchain explorer to confirm it arrived safely at the public address. And if you ever enter the private key on any site, consider it compromised and create a new paper wallet. You can create as many copies as you like and keep them in multiple safe locations. You can even do some kind of secret sharing technique that requires M of N paper wallets (e.g. 3 of 5) to construct the key.\n\nSome kind of metal doohicky to record your key (like cryptosteel or cryptotag or others). Either via tiles or imprints/etching, basically a fire/water-resistant version of a paper wallet. Usually these are used in conjunction with a hardware wallet.\n\nHardware wallets. Ledger and Trezor are the main big names, but there are probably others. I own both a Ledger and a Trezor. I prefer the hardware of the Trezor Model T, but the software integration of the Ledger...overall, the hardware of the Trezor is my preference. Get it straight from the manufacturer and create a new seed from new phrase words at start up and go through the motions of resetting and recovering your wallet. Even if you have a hardware wallet, though, you should still have a physical solution to backup your secret phrase (e.g. paper/metal doohicky).\n\nSince you're new, I'll emphasize that blockchain assets are never *in* a device/wallet. They exist digitally on the blockchain and the hardware device/secret key just give you permission to control the assets. The benefit of the hardware wallet is that the secret key never leaves the device (unlike with a paper wallet where you still have to physically type a secret key into a website)...the hardware wallet just tells your computer yes/no you can access the assets for which the hardware wallet is set to. If you lose/destroy your hardware wallet, you can get a new hardware wallet, use your secret phrase you recorded to recover access, and all will be well. You can even have a dozen hardware wallets at a time and if you program each of them with the same secret phrase, they'll all have the ability to manipulate the exact same assets. (Edit: do not attempt to store your secret phrase on a computer or in the cloud or whatever as text/image. If you must, use really good encryption and bury it in a previous revision of a cooking recipe or something. But I still advise to not try being \"clever\" and just keep that stuff offline).\n\nA single hardware wallet can access coins on many different blockchains. That single wallet has a single secret phrase.\n\nIf you went the paper wallet route, you'd have to keep multiple paper wallets for each blockchain.",

It isn't as exciting when the price goes down because I am not spending any money on it, but there is zero stress when the price drops as well. They also pay interest on your USD balance, that is up by $100 in only a few weeks, so if it drops any more, I might consider turning the profits into lumens. So much easier also set a target price, which we would definitely need to jump over ATH to reach.",

                    "response": "Just gonna comment on the DEX piece:\n\nThe DEX is a really powerful tool that I think is often underappreciated. It is a single source of liquidity in the Stellar network, which has the potential to make the blockchain massively capital efficient. On Ethereum, liquidity is highly fragmented between various AMM protocols and DEX protocols. This lack of one central liquidity source results in worse pricing, and more arbitrage transaction spam. To be fair, this is a theoretical comparison; unfortunately, there isn't much liquidity on Stellar's DEX. Hopefully, this will change in the coming months when DeFi lending protocols like [YieldBlox](https://www.script3.io/ybx) and AMM proposals like [CAP-37/38](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0037.md) are implemented.\n\nFurthermore, the DEX is incredibly useful for financial protocols that need to create tradeable assets out of different financial instruments. We use this in our [options protocol](https://docs.optionblox.com/#/whitepaper). There are plenty of other use cases. What if you created an NFT index to solve NFT liquidity issues? You bundle many NFTs together and make them redeemable for an index token with an offer on the DEX. Then people can trade the index token and redeem it for the underlying NFTs at any point by filling the DEX offer. I'm just spitballing here. The bottom line is the DEX can be used pretty creatively for a variety of financial applications\n\nFinally, path payments are incredibly useful. You can read more about them here: [https://developers.stellar.org/docs/start/list-of-operations/#path-payment-strict-send](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/start/list-of-operations/#path-payment-strict-send) This kind of operation is extremely dependant on there being a DEX.",

Monero is a rare exception with the level of privacy it provides. Some other coins have optional privacy, but because it's not the default and the private transaction volume is relatively low, it's typically not hard to figure out who sent something \"privately.\"\n\nI don't think something like Monero's privacy is on the roadmap. There's Starlight, which is a payment channel thing akin to Lightning, but it only makes activity private against outside observers...the two parties transacting can still view payments between each other.\n\nEdit: I hold no Monero, though I have admired it from afar for years.",

                            "response": "First of all it's an actual use-case for XLM. As part of the #stellarfamily, we are also using coinqvest, a payment processor built on Stellar that settles payments on Stellar. Showing to new users that you can send keep and trade other (anchored) cryptocurrencies on the Stellar DEX.\n\nAfter release of the game, players will be able to trade in-game items as assets on the Stellar DEX with each other or cash out to FIAT. This means that you can theoretically pay with resources you gathered in the game wherever XLM or other Stellar based tokens are accepted. This in my opinion is huge for Stellar when other gamedevs realize that they can run a whole game-economy on Stellar by tapping into the already existing DEX infrastructure without the need to develop their own trading-engine. In a lot of cases, Stellar is better suited for in-game items than other, people just overlook it due to the ethereum dominance.\n\nDirect benefit for XLM the coin? Maybe the minimum and trustline balances being locked up we'll have to provide for active players. How do other coins directly benefit from a project? I don't know any project that gives a direct benefit for ETH except by using the ethereum blockchain and providing exposure that way.\n\nI think the biggest benefit will be that we will be able to show a lot of people the real powers of the Network, especially to people new to crypto as a whole. Players don't need to own or know anything about crypto to start playing. The first DLT project they learn about will be the Stellar Network. No metamask, no balance for transactions. This zero-barrier approach should show others to take a closer look at Stellar and its features like the SDEX and path payments.\n\nI could go on but I hope this answers your question, if you have more specific questions, feel free to ask :)",

They have value also because they can be used as a universal currency on the network or as a bridge currency in the path payments feature.\n\nIf the price goes up too much and the fees would become too high, validators can vote to lower them. The transaction fee is 0.000001 XLM, so even at $100 per XLM it's still less than a cent per transaction. The minimum balance to keep your wallet active is 1 XLM and you need to hold 0.5 XLM per trustline (approval that your wallet can hold another asset issued on Stellar).

Thus, a 1,000 dollar investment on either will become 2,000 dollars. \n\nAs for supply yes you would be correct that Stellar will never reach 50,000 or even close to that its unreasonable to believe that. But, its not unreasonable to think that it could possibly reach 1 dollar or maybe even 5 dollars which would still provide an insane return.",

The Stellar Dev Foundation is working on a lot of major connections, laying groundwork, working with countries around the world, so if they're successful at that the market cap could probably 10x in a decade (just a guess). I see XLM as a long term hold for that reason.",

AnchorUSD for example. They use your held funds to make loans, process transaction on the network etc. all of those little gas fees or \u201cloan interest payments\u201d go back into the ecosystem that keeps it running, IE the holder. \n\nThis is probably the easy way I can explain it although I\u2019m sure someone could do a better job at it.",
