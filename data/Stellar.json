Most of the long term holders never sold or made money, and the people with large holding that did sell created critical infrastructure that has made the network one of the only usable network at scale. \n\nTo put this into perspective. Samsung wants to create a tv that can display NFTs off the blockchain.  The way ETH works, you need scan the entire blockchain to determine what nft a wallet holds, and compute cost to constantly scan every block and see if any changes to the users nft collection appears will be huge.  So Samsung may do that for the TV as a service, but that\u2019s literally no different than a Facebook or Instagram feed.  \nWith stellar you could sign a wallet to display your wallet assets that are tagged with specific metadata. Pretty much every other nft capable blockchain like solana and cardano are in beta and likely won\u2019t work, because of the way they approached developing their core system.  You can look into turrets to get a better technical explanation on the benefits of performing compute and transactions on different layers.",

By design, anyone who runs a validator chooses which other validators to trust, and those are the only validators they consult when deciding on whether to ratify a transaction set.\n\n\r  \nIf you have a million validators, and they all only trust the same single validator, for instance, the network is not at all decentralized.  If that validator fails, the network halts.  Two years ago, that's more or less how the network was configured: most validators exclusively trusted the SDF validators.  If those validators failed, the network halted.\n\n\r  \nFor the network to be decentralized, validators need to distribute trust across several other validators.  Right now, for instance, the majority of validators include 6 organizations in their circle of trust (aka their quorum set) in addition to SDF.  So 7 total.  Because the consensus protocol has a threshold of 5 out of 7 \u2014 in other words, for a validator to agree to ratify a set, 5 of those 7 organizations need to agree \u2014 it can, generally, tolerate the failure of multiple organizations before it halts.\n\n\r  \nRight now, SDF could turn off its validators, and the network would persist.\n\n  \nThere's a community blog post that raises a key point: \"A key observation is that the Stellar network has evolved towards decentralization by reshaping the nodes and trust decisions in 2019 and 2020.\"\r  \nhttps://medium.com/stellar-community/researching-the-mathematics-behind-the-stellar-consensus-protocol-342e974f97ed\r  \n\r  \nCould it be more decentralized?  Yes.  But it's in pretty good shape and new organizations can (and probably will) be added to the tier one validators.\n\n\r  \nUnlike proof of work and proof of stake networks, there is no financial incentive for running a Stellar validator.  Validators do not earn rewards.\n\n\r  \nThe incentives for running a validator are, essentially:\r  \nTo improve network health and decentralization\r  \nTo align your business with the Stellar brand\r  \nFor issuers, running a validator allows them to make it clear to customers that they will only honor transactions their validator ratifies.\n\n\r  \nAll of those choices are by design.  Unlike PoW and PoS networks, Stellar is designed to connect to the existing financial system, and validators are not anonymous, and they're generally not enthusiastic community members or mercenary organizations that profit off of their network participation.  Rather, validators are companies that offer real financial services built on Stellar, and they self identify, and other validators trust them because they know and trust the organizations that run them.  The network allows known entities to come together to keep a common ledger.",

                    "response": "Stellar is an interesting design in that there is one underlying decentralized platform on top of which somewhat independent/interconnected and more centralized entities can be created.\n\n\nIn a very short ELI5, you can think of XLM like an ocean. XLM connects everything, and anyone can jump in and swim freely (become a validator) if they want to. However, you can only use XLM in the way the platform is designed for it to be used, you have no control over it (i.e. it's decentralized). On top of this ocean it is also possible to create islands. These islands (custom tokens) are both connected to the ocean, but also separate from other islands. Islands can only communicate (trade/exchange) with other islands by sending boats (transactions) over the XLM ocean. The neat thing about islands though is that whoever creates them has total control over their token, including the ability to take them back from people (wallets) that they were given to. The fact that XLM itself is an open and decentralized medium of exchange means that the platform as a whole is decentralized and permission-less, but the ability to create new assets on top of the platform that are totally under your own control means that centralized entities like banks, companies and even yourself can tokenize your assets according to your own needs and without fear that someone might use your tokens in a way you don't approve of.\n\n\nThe most common use-case of Stellar is for banks/financial services to setup what are usually called \"Anchors\" and these typically create a token that is pegged to some fiat, like USDC is a coin pegged to the USD. USDC can be exchanged with other assets on the platform, allowing you to pay for things using that asset, but the issuer of USDC also has the power to take back tokens if you misuse their asset (e.g. stealing tokens, running scams, defrauding clients, etc). Anchors allow banks to easily switch between real USD and virtual USDC with the confidence that they have total control over their financial assets, and this is a very valuable feature for them.\n\n\nMore recent use-cases include rewards tokens (e.g. litemint.io CREDITs) and NFTs (e.g litemint.com NFT store).",

Got no response at all from these two. \n\nThe investments SDF has done over the past years have been made mainly in companies that don't benefit the ecosystem at all. These companies just take the money but they don't give back anything to the community. For example the Ethereum foundation invested in Uniswap, this was huge since it gave eth more use cases. But what has the stellar ecosystem gained with all the money invested lately? \n\nIt's clear by now that stellar has missed the DeFi train, but I still believe they have to invest in companies that can give back to the community and not just ones that are looking so selfishly to get profit.",

This is of course, not professional or financial advice.\n\n- It doesn't appear to be tracked on Coinmarketcap, which is pretty weird honestly.

Assuming even only 50% of those people are paying attention and get their free coins, that's still a 300% increase to the circulating supply a month from now.\n\n- 22.5% is locked for 3 years.  I suppose it's good that it's locked but in about 33 months, there will be a wild and massive -60% crash again.\n\n- Throughout this entire time, 50% will be rewarded to those providing liquidity.

                    "response": "u/Turbulent_Chef_9570 Good post, but you made a few mistakes. Here is my take:\n\nFirst, Bitcoin's value proposition trumps any other altcoin. Bitcoin is the TRUE innovator and the ONLY coin that is in its own asset class, there is no other to compete with it. It can be equated to digital energy, digital gold or even a store of time/effort. This has never happened before in modern history. Selling Bitcoin for any other altcoin is like swapping gold in exchange for copper. The fact that Bitcoin NEEDS to be mined with energy is what gives it VALUE. You then transfer BTC and sell it for energy and you just moved any amount of energy instantly anywhere in the world for $2. This is unprecedented.\n\nHence, bitcoin is a store of value, the best one we have at this time in the world. So any \"profits\" have to be moved INTO Bitcoin if you want to keep them and increase them on the long term. The same cannot be said about XLM which is very successful at what it sets out to do, but that is certainly NOT being a store of value.\n\nSecond, XLM excellent design is also its shortcoming for anyone expecting returns like with Bitcoin. XLM has nearly FREE transaction costs, it is NOT mined like Bitcoin and it is instant. This makes for an excellent network to transact on and provide liquidity. Can this increase the price of XLM? Not really, unless it becomes the world exchange medium for transactions.\n\nThird, I disagree that XLM and SDF are not doing a good job at innovating. Them upgrading XLM network with protocol 19 and enabling automated market makers is a statement that SDF is not really useless. On the contrary, the AQUA airdrops and rewards are SDF giving BACK to the community in a way, this is real value, CASH in your pocket.\n\nForth, you made a mistake to think XLM excellent network capabilities will give value to its token. This happens to a certain degree, but nowhere near to Bitcoin which requires real energy to create! XLM is a highly centralized and efficient network. But that is a poor choice if you are after a high return on your investment in XLM tokens.\n\nFifth, XLM is excellent for developers to build on top of it. But it did not innovate to the level ETH smart contracts did, that currently locks over $160 bil in value on the ETH network. This includes Uniswap liquidity and DAI stabecoin among others. XLM tried to provide similar services at almost no gas fees, but the first mover advantage is with ETH, just like BTC is king and in its own class. By comparison, XLM AMM has a total locked value of $60 mil right now. Not too bad for a month since release, but VERY late to this party.\n\nSixth, XLM incentives to use the network were very poor for very long, until now. Yes, the network is fast and almost free to use. So what actually happened was, people sold BTC for XLM, moved XLM instantly and nearly free say to another exchange and then sold XLM back for Bitcoin. What is the added value of XLM besides its instant/free network? Not many reasons to HODL XLM. What is the incentive? The current AQUA rewards is a great start in fixing this. With more incentives and network growth XLM can increase in value too.\n\nSeventh, XLM is highly centralized with less than 50 nodes. If SDF bails and other key nodes stop working, XLM is dead. This will never happen with Bitcoin as it is decentralized and will ALWAYS have incentives to mine it due to its rewards structure. XLM has no such structure, it used to have inflation, but that hardly compares to Bitcoin's innovation which includes proof of work. In this sense, Bitcoin REMAINS superiors to all other altcoins. Proof of stake coins or similar are inferior if you are after \"store of value\". BTC also has huge network value now...\n\nYou blame SDF for doing their job and selling XLM, but XLM was hardly the best choice for long term HODL strategy and store of value. Yes, XLM is an excellent network, great fundamentals, but that does NOT translate in its token increasing in value, at least not currently. That was your mistake. Once crypto goes mainstream, XLM will stand out due to its fundamentals. The token will benefit from it and increase in price, but remember, a high priced XLM token makes its network LESS efficient, cost wise... look at ETH. When ETH was new, gas fees were almost 0 too. Now it is a HUGE problem and it can't scale properly, this again is NOT a problem for Bitcoin, because Bitcoin scales in it's VALUE or price to compensate and it keeps things SIMPLE. Worked great for over 10 years so far.\n\nWhile most look for the next hottest altcoin to buy, they don't see that the true innovation was and remains Bitcoin. The BTC price is proof of that. Remember BTC started with a price of $0.01. It reached $66k this year or almost a 7 million fold increase in price. 1 cent in 2009 is worth $50k today. XLM did not fare that bad either with at 3,000x increase since launch, but hardly a match compared to BTC.\n\nAt the end of the day, feels like you bought XLM at the top or near the top and you barely doubled you cash. :P XLM is not a bad coin really, but perhaps you always wanted to buy Bitcoin and did not know why you should do that instead.",

Also, Stellar\u2019s network is gaining infrastructure, has many projects built upon it, can hold and trade fiats, has a lot more features (like grab back), and is introducing AMMs soon. Lightning isn\u2019t there, can\u2019t get there, and does not have the project behind it to be anything major. \n\nMany crypto investors think that crypto is going to get around governments and institutions. There is no chance that happens. Just as we saw this morning in China, the government buried the crypto market with enforcement plans. If the US and Euros outlaw Bitcoin, it\u2019s value will get crushed. That won\u2019t happen to Stellar because they embrace the governments. They actually operate Ukraine\u2019s fiat money! \n\nStellar is a long term hold, y\u2019all. But things should start to shake loose here by the end of year. If the US Treasury builds the Dollar on Stellar, it\u2019s absolutely massive. That might happen. I think it should happen.",

                    "response": "Short answer:Tokens are directly issued on the Stellar network from an account whereas the Ethereum network requires a smart contract to create a token. So it's easier and simpler to created a token on Stellar.\n\nMore details about Stellar Smart Contracts (warning incoming wall of text):\n\nStellar Smart Contracts (aka SSCs) combine transactions with various constraints to achieve an end result. Referencing the Stellar.org SSCs guide, the following are examples of constraints that can be combined to create SSCs:\n\nMultisignature \u2014 Multisig requires multiple parties to sign transactions on an account. You can also assign signature weights and thresholds.\n\nBatching / Atomicity \u2014 Batching is the concept of including multiple operations in a single transaction. Atomicity is the guarantee that given a series of operations, if one operation fails they all fail.\n\nSequence \u2014 Sequences are represented on Stellar via sequence numbers. Sequence numbers can be used to manipulate transactions and guarantee that certain transactions do not succeed if an alternative is submitted.\n\nTime bounds \u2014 Time bounds are limitations on the time period that a transaction is valid and can be used to represent time in a Stellar smart contract.\n\nThis short list of constraints means SSCs are limited in scope when compared to Ethereum smart contracts, but you can still come up with some creative use cases such as escrow contracts, joint entity crowdfunding, lightning channels, and more. You can also write them in the programming language of your choice \u2014 limiting the amount of errors and potential attacks.\n\nAnother key difference between SSCs and Ethereum smart contracts is that the conditions and logic of the smart contract are created separately from Stellar then submitted to the network as a transaction when the end conditions are met. As a participant in a Stellar smart contract you are not directly interacting with code on chain, but instead agreeing to the conditions of a transaction.\n\nFor example, say Alice wants to commission Bob for a piece of art. They come to an agreement that if Bob can finish the art piece in 30 days, Alice will pay him $100, but if it takes longer Alice only has to pay $70. Alice could then use a combination of an escrow account, multi-sig, and/or time-bounds to construct a transaction for both end conditions. Control of the escrow account could then be given to a trusted third party. Once the piece of art is finished, the transaction corresponding to the end condition (was it finished in 30 days or not) is submitted to the network by the trusted party. Bob receives his funds and Alice is only charged for the proper end condition.",

In this operating model, the malware is created by the ransomware developer, while the ransomware affiliate is responsible for infecting the target computer system and negotiating the ransom payment with the victim organisation. This new businessmodel has revolutionised ransomware, opening it up to those who do not have the technical capability to create malware, but are willing and able to infiltrate a target organisation.*\n\n...\n\n*Following the money*\n\n*Using Elliptic\u2019s blockchain analytics we can follow the ransom payments and see where the bitcoins are being spent or exchanged. What we find is that the majority of the funds are being sent to cryptoasset exchanges, where they can be swapped for other cryptoassets, or fiat currency.*\n\n*The majority of cryptoasset exchanges comply with anti money laundering regulations. They verify their customers\u2019 identity and report suspicious activity. They also use blockchain analytics tools such as those offered by Elliptic, to check customer deposits for links to illicit activity such as ransomware.*\n\n*However some jurisdictions do not enforce these regulations, and it is to exchanges in these locations that much of the DarkSide ransomware proceeds are being sent. Regulated cryptoasset businesses should perform careful due diligence on the virtual asset service providers (VASPs) that they transact with.

                    "response": "Just gonna comment on the DEX piece:\n\nThe DEX is a really powerful tool that I think is often underappreciated. It is a single source of liquidity in the Stellar network, which has the potential to make the blockchain massively capital efficient. On Ethereum, liquidity is highly fragmented between various AMM protocols and DEX protocols. This lack of one central liquidity source results in worse pricing, and more arbitrage transaction spam. To be fair, this is a theoretical comparison; unfortunately, there isn't much liquidity on Stellar's DEX. Hopefully, this will change in the coming months when DeFi lending protocols like [YieldBlox](https://www.script3.io/ybx) and AMM proposals like [CAP-37/38](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0037.md) are implemented.\n\nFurthermore, the DEX is incredibly useful for financial protocols that need to create tradeable assets out of different financial instruments. We use this in our [options protocol](https://docs.optionblox.com/#/whitepaper). There are plenty of other use cases. What if you created an NFT index to solve NFT liquidity issues? You bundle many NFTs together and make them redeemable for an index token with an offer on the DEX. Then people can trade the index token and redeem it for the underlying NFTs at any point by filling the DEX offer. I'm just spitballing here. The bottom line is the DEX can be used pretty creatively for a variety of financial applications\n\nFinally, path payments are incredibly useful. You can read more about them here: [https://developers.stellar.org/docs/start/list-of-operations/#path-payment-strict-send](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/start/list-of-operations/#path-payment-strict-send) This kind of operation is extremely dependant on there being a DEX.",

In terms of the bid and ask, it's not only the issuers who will be offering bids and asks + if a spread becomes too large then people will avoid it, so it's in the issuer's best interest to maintain liquidity of their token on the dex if they want wide usage of their token",

The rates of some of the issuers is something that these companies decide on. That's not a network feature. The binance or coinbase fees are also not a feature or bug of the internet. Competition will drive down these fees.\n\n3. You give examples where you explain that kyc information is not \"decentralized\" in your opinion. What is important to understand is that the network is a decentralized network that centralized companies can connect to. Coinbase, binance, your regular bank, exchange office, they all require some amount of kyc. On and offramps will always have that. Once you hold the assets, you are free to exchange them over the sdex though. If you don't want kyc or higher fees you can use xlm ofcourse. \n\n4.

We hope to prosper from the value of XLM rising compared to the US dollar. Ideally, in the future I can use XLM to pay for my life and not USD or taxes on using a US CBDC. \n\nEssentially, we hope to profit on XLM through arbitrage.

I also felt this way when I jumped in to crypto in 2017.\n\nAs I have learned more about what it (and more specifically Blockchain) can do, I have come to the realization that anyone dropping any amount of money in to it right now can only win. It\u2019s really just a matter of whether you have the patience to be able to sit and watch while it all unfolds or not. People bouncing around between coins don\u2019t have the patience, which is why they are trying to rush their gains forward. They\u2019ll be alright though as long as they see the signs early enough to dump out of nothingburgers and scoop up projects with solid fundamentals that are making big waves.\n\nI think the main reason people feel like they are late, or have missed out entirely is because of BTC\u2019s story. The fact that you could set up an old PC to mine it essentially for free in the beginning, AND actually come out with a decent quantity. AND now for it to have gone from almost zero value to being worth 50 grand a piece....it hurts. It does make you feel like you missed out.

The Fed is already studying the issue.\n\nMuch like Venmo or Paypal, a digital dollar and related payment system would provide \u201cfaster, safer and cheaper\u201d method of exchanging money, especially for people without bank accounts and the like.\n\n\u201cToo many Americans don\u2019t really have access to easy payment systems,\u201d Yellen said.\n\nConsider the recent federal stimulus checks. The establishment of a digital dollar could have allowed the government to send every American a check directly to their mobile phone or personal account in a blink of an eye.\n\nInstead, some payments took weeks to reach recipients through snail mail or bank deposits. And others who were eligible never got their money at all.",

It's really the only coin i've seen that has the appearance and organizational attitude of distributing as a real digital currency. (And the performance/simplicity to do it.)",

There is going to be a time where Bitcoin will slide down from #2 in market cap.\nMaybe Ether will first take #1 spot or even Ltc, but that doee not matter. When that will start happening, valid alts will start going up a lot (again in market cap, not necessarily price).\n\nRight now it is still very unbalanced with Btc having more than 60% of the total 1.6T market. That is because Btc has the first-player advantage, it is the \"Altavista/Excite/AOL\" of the year 2000-2002 dotcom era\", while some of the alts are like \"Google\", they are better but they are still unknown. I remember talking to people about Google and they would look at me like \"what?\" and they would rather keep using Yahoo, Aol... but then more and more shift to Google till there was a tipping point and Google quickly passed all the others and left them in the dust.\n\nAs more people get educated and discover the benefits of some of the alts, others will emerge as more useful and efficient than Bitcoin and the market cap will shift significantly towards some of the alts.\n\nHard to guess, but many like Stellar, Cardano, Nano, are well positioned to do what they have been designed for and therefore gain a big share of the market.\n\nAs far as investing, I would stay away from Btc. It is purely speculative at this point. It does very poorly what it was designed to do and is very inefficient. It is bad for climate as it uses a ton of energy and it is just a matter of time before the buzz around Btc bill change into people becoming more educated and open their eyes towards some of the alts.",

I mean it works in my favor I guess as it helps me earn more but this also happening happening I buy. I placed a buy order for some dogecoin the other day at like .040 cents and the thing ended up dropping to like .375 and it still didn't buy. I always end up having to do market orders because if you use \"standard order\" it seems to rip you off and charge some price way higher than its currently trading for.",

I believe the cause is that the size of your order is too large, and there isn\u2019t enough on the other side.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges are all separate, not like a stock market. When you place a limit order on AnchorUSD, it\u2019s placed as a \u201cfill or kill\u201d in stock trading terms, not \u201cpartial fill,\u201d and I believe local to the AnchorUSD exchange. Obviously, people around the world are transferring assets in and out of different wallets and exchanges, but AnchorUSD generally has lower volume compared to the larger platforms like Coinbase or Binance.\n\nSo, I would either try to lower the number of shares, set multiple buy/sell walls with different prices, or just have eyeballs glued to the screen and do a market sell at the price you are happy with, and just take a little bit less.\n\nRegarding the \u201crip you off\u201d aspect, yeah, I\u2019ve also noticed that AnchorUSD has either slower action or the market order has a larger spread. My assumption is that they are making money off the spread as well.\n\nTo counteract this issue, I recommend using AnchorUSD for assets that you plan to buy and hold and collect interest on, and for your crypto assets that you want to actively trade, just go with Coinbase Pro. Coinbase Pro allows partial fills and charges a fee, but you\u2019re more likely to get the orders filled for specific price targets.",

I figured that my limit orders were only going towards other Anchor users but I wasn't 100% certain and would definitely explain why they just sit there. Have you ever used Kraken? I recently got verified there and thought about sending out my crypto currencies that I bought in Anchor to Kraken for anything I'm actively trading. Do you think Anchor is secure enough to let some stuff sit and gather interest as opposed to storing it in a wallet? I'm still new to all of this and trying to learn the ropes. I downloaded \"The Crypto App\" and set alerts for specific price points as a way to offset Anchors limit order problems. When it goes off I just open it up and do a quick market buy / sell.",

Nexo is based in Switzerland, and while the idea of having a \u201cSwiss bank account\u201d is kind of cool, I\u2019m not personally wealthy enough to consider something like that, yet, as I don\u2019t have the mental bandwidth to research the risks of Nexo.\n\nAnchorUSD is made in the USA and headquartered in the USA, and I prefer it because I am a US citizen.\n\nWhile governments aren\u2019t perfect, I feel that if the company is able to figure out how to set up and operate legally in the US, that already speaks a lot with respect to the ability of the team to navigate the system.\n\nSecond, the higher rewards for Nexo coins are not available to US citizens, so if you\u2019re a US citizen, you\u2019d only be eligible for the lower rate, not the higher one.\n\nThird, I generally don\u2019t like companies that spend a lot on advertising, because I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a good business model. I\u2019d prefer a company/service that largely devotes their resources to making a better product and providing better service, rather than one that spends a lot on marketing. Maybe Nexo has a bigger team, but all of those expenses will also proportionally increase as the service grows. My impression is that the AnchorUSD team is more heads down focused on building.\n\nFourth, AnchorUSD pays out interest daily. I LOVE getting that push notification every day seeing the interest added to my account. I think Nexo might have something similar. I think Nexo is nice, but they just have a lot of products and the ability to borrow against your crypto, etc, which is pretty complicated. I have some XLM in Nexo, mostly just to try it out. I prefer AnchorUSD for the simplicity of the UI.\n\nBonus: you didn\u2019t ask about it, but another service that is similar is Abra. Between AnchorUSD and Abra, I prefer AnchorUSD because Abra pays out interest weekly. Also, the UI appears uglier to me.",

What isn't mentioned is that Anchor also has a small slide (sometimes 1%) on the price of the crypto, obviously in their favor. I use Webull to see the actual price. For example when  btc was 18,990 I put an market order in anchor. It processed at 19,050. It may have fluctuated in the time to purchase but I doubt it. This is easy to counter by putting in limit orders where you set the price. Regarding the comment on \"pending transactions ID\" it depends on the crypto (ltc, bch, xlm, xrp are fast) (btc is super slow) and how much you are sending. The larger the amount the higher priority for the blockchain. Ie if you tried sending $10 btc, it could take months if it even ever gets processed.",

Real risk, and dangerous for the whole crypto sphere, to use highly volatile crypto collateral at its USD value in lending. The Alice in the example must be a gambler with her life savings or otherwise have very high risk tolerance (or have tens of millions stashed away somewhere less risky).",

The banks can still make money through traditional means like fees etc., but transactions will be settled on the network. So essentially, the banks can charge whatever they want for whatever services, but now their transactions (if they transact on Stellar), will be significantly cheaper for the banks. And recent regulations now allow them to just do that. So there's little reason why they wouldn't, other than maybe privacy.",

I\u2019m surprised you don\u2019t mention Algorand.    Their model, team and connections are certainly worth noting as competition.   I see Algo as highly performant and they are also clearly aiming to be the winner in this space.    \n\nIf you research the brain trust at MIT and the Fed\u2019s Boston branch office where much work is being conducted on requirements for a Digital Dollar, you\u2019ll find that there are some connections to Algorand.   I suspect that Silvio Micali has good line of site on the requirements and has a good chance of positioning Algorand favorably for meeting those requirements (as they evolve and come into clarity).\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to think about and exciting on both sides.   I hold both XLM and Algo, but am leaning more toward Algorand at this point in time.\n\nDumb?   Why Stellar over Algorand?   \n\nThanks for a great post!",

You can create a payment in Stellar that will automatically convert your sheep into wheat. It goes through the sheep/wheat orderbook and converts your sheep at the best available rate.\n\n>You can also make more complicated paths of asset conversion. Imagine that the sheep/wheat orderbook has a very large spread or is nonexistent. In this case, you might get a better rate if you first trade your sheep for brick and then sell that brick for wheat. So a potential path would be 2 hops: sheep->brick->wheat. This path would take you through the sheep/brick orderbook and then the brick/wheat orderbook.\n\n>These paths of asset conversion can contain up to 6 hops, but the whole payment is atomic\u2013it will either succeed or fail. The payment sender will never be left holding an unwanted asset.\n\n>This process of finding the best path of a payment is called pathfinding. Pathfinding involves looking at the current orderbooks and finding which series of conversions gives you the best rate. It is handled outside of Stellar Core by something like Horizon.\n\nhttps://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/exchange.html#cross-asset-payments",

There is also some comfort (in my opinion) knowing that SDF is organized as a non-profit, so there are no founders/investors entitled to share of profits. \n\n\n>Network contains only ~35 validators which are heavily centralized around SDF nodes creating network-wide vulnerability\n\nActually, the list you link shows closer to 80.  I agree that it could still improve though! And 2019 was great in this regard.  Keep in mind also that unlike POW protocols, which require a lot of validators to decentralize the network, the total number of validators needed on Stellar is significantly lower.  \n\n\nSecond, I wouldn't put too much weight on those other articles, without going in to too much detail... they are just outdated.  As stated, \"the figure shows the structure of the quorum slices on January 22, 2019.\"  However, A LOT has changed over the last year, including major steps in decentralization.  Today, the network has decentralized away from SDF's validators, as recently discussed [here](https://www.stellar.org/blog/a-look-back-and-a-look-forward-for-2020/) by SDF in their year-end blog looking back on 2019 (\"This group of Tier 1 validators is mature enough at this point that we could turn off our nodes and the network would keep going!\") and recently [here] (https://stellar.expert/blog/stellarexpert-validators-quorum-set) by one of those Tier 1 validator operators (\"When the Stellar mainnet was deployed, most of the validators depended on the SDF quorum set, delegating voting power to SDF. Now it is a fully decentralized network.\")\n\n>Small team (~7) control the majority of the development work\n\nSDF is much larger than that... according Denelle's blog, which is linked above, \"SDF has grown fivefold [in 2019]- up from 11 to 56 employees.\"\n\n\n>No financial incentive (like a mining reward in the Bitcoin protocol) to become a node, which could lead to a dearth of nodes and node centralization\n\nIt's comparatively cheap to run a validator b/c of the significantly less energy that's needed, and while its true that there is no direct financial incentive (i.e. mining), there are incentives.  A business building on Stellar has major incentives to help secure the network that its business depends on, and compared to Bitcoin validators (whose only incentive is financial), these validators become much better partners.   Not to disparage the miners on Bitcoin, but the big ones have largely been anything but good partners.  In my opinion, due in full because of how the incentives work on POW protocols.\n\n>Questionable response by the Stellar team to disclose a bug that was discovered (and patched) in 2017\n\nIs this (below) the questionable response you're referring to?  This is what is given as their response in the link you provided.  I guess I fail to see what's questionable about that. \n\n\"We mentioned it twice, in fact, in the notes, and we were very clear the bug had been exploited. From there, we took the additional step of burning Lumens to \u201ctrue up\" the supply, so that current $XLM owners wouldn\u2019t be diluted and our projected total supply would remain accurate. We recognize that Stellar has since become significant financial software, and our disclosure standards have grown to reflect that reality. There\u2019s been no notable bug since, and if there were we would disclose it in full detail as soon as it was patched. As we announced last month in our 2019 Roadmap we have already committed to a full accounting of all of SDF\u2019s Lumens by the end of the year, and more details around this old bug were going to be (and still will be) part of that.\u201d",

I think the biggest thing that people are struggling with is that the SDF is different than Tron or XRP in regards to how they distribute their tokens. There is not any incentive to artificially pump XLM from their perspective, so the amount being held isn\u2019t as big of a deal as others. But keep in mind that they want to distribute the remaining into as many different hands as possible. They have taken steps in giveaways or airdrops to ensure that people aren\u2019t gaining an unfair advantage (Keybase airdrop for example was stopped all together because of that). \nIf you have followed the SDF closely for the past few years you would see that they are very careful with how they handle everything and that is very different than just about every other crypto out there period. They would rather their actions do the talking and that is very rare in this space",

But allow me to push back on a couple now....\n\n1. \"I can understand why this is concerning to people, but you can read more about the Stellar mandate [here](https://www.stellar.org/foundation/mandate) on how those XLM will be used.\"  - Seems like you understand my thought process so no need to really harp on it but the fact that there IS a mandate from a central authority is the issue. Having a company dictate your money supply is no different/worse than government. Plus, that mandate is irrelevant now because their prior plans didn't include destroying half the money supply but they did that anyway. Without asking, telling, or engaging the communty. So that mandate isn't worth a damn IMO.\n2. \"Actually, the list you link shows closer to 80... Keep in mind also that unlike POW protocols, which require a lot of validators to decentralize the network, the total number of validators needed on Stellar is significantly lower.\"  - Close to 80 validators but 36 full validators. And can you expound on why the number of validators would need to be lower in Stellar? I'm familiar with SCP but maybe missing a crucial detail.\n3. \"SDF is much larger than that... according Denelle's blog, which is linked above, \"SDF has grown fivefold \\[in 2019\\]- up from 11 to 56 employees.\"    - I'm sure the SDF is growing. Non-profits, like governments, tend only to grow, not shrink. But that doesn't mean all those people are writing code. The Stellar [Github](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/graphs/contributors?from=2019-07-26&to=2020-01-19&type=c) paints a different story and supports my claim of around 6-7 people maintaining Stellar core.\n4. \"... and while its true that there is no direct financial incentive (i.e. mining), there are incentives. A business building on Stellar has major incentives to help secure the network that its business depends on, and compared to Bitcoin validators (whose only incentive is financial), these validators become much better partners.\"   - This is the common rebuttal I hear most but I do not think it's valid. Sure, there's a tangential/2nd order benefit from helping the network but it's not material enough to create a robust set of validators. Because it without a real financial incentive, new participants become apathetic or lazy thinking, \"well I guess the current people are doing a good enough job. I'll just let them handle it.\" Bitcoin's mining competition/market is brutal. That's true. But I believe it makes it MORE anti-fragile rather than a small group of companies agreeing to play nice with each other.... for now.\n5.   \"Is this (below) the questionable response you're referring to? This is what is given as their response in the link you provided. I guess I fail to see what's questionable about that.\"   - As someone else stated, it's not in SDF best interest to announce the bug in real time but I believe they addressed it [buried](https://www.stellar.org/developers/stellar-core/software/security-protocol-release-notes.html) in their website, sandwiched between technical stuff that no one reads. It happened in 2017 and it took mainstream media over a year to really catch on. So, dont think the SDF was really forthcoming about it. Regardless, this is the least important thing to me but to me it seems like they were doing the bare minimum to bring it to light during the epic bull run of 2017. \n\nMy last comment is that several of the things you linked to were from the SDF themself. I do not put much stock in self-promotional material. I mean, every project and website, is going to spin things in a positive light to make their project look the best. I mean, do I even need to link to Ripple or Tron's sites? So, as you can see with those examples, you have to take information from the team (that has a vested interest in the price) with a grain of salt.",

Despite your comparison to a government central authority (which in my opinion is not a very good one), once all the XLM has been distributed, that's it.  You can't make more, unlike governments.  This is just a temporary problem, and the most you can ask for is a fair, transparent, and equitable way for the XLM to be distributed, which also furthers the specific purpose of growing the network.  The mandate is on that track, but if someone still has issues with it then it's their decision to make, and they can wait until all/more of the XLM has been distributed, I guess.  \n\nAs a side note... ALL cryptocurrencies struggle with centralized and/or disproportionate distribution of the supply.  For example, many POW coins were almost exclusively mined by the founders for months or years before it became what it is today, or even today a vast % of the mining is dominated by a small number of people.  This is far more harmful than a non-profit distributing XLM over a 10 year period.\n\n>Plus, that mandate is irrelevant now because their prior plans didn't include destroying half the money supply but they did that anyway. Without asking, telling, or engaging the communty. So that mandate isn't worth a damn IMO.\n\nSorry, but that's just dead wrong.  Throughout 2018 and 2019 the most frequent criticism/request/complaint by the community to SDF was (1) to remove the inflation mechanism and (2) to reduce the total uncirculated supply.  These topics were discussed so much, it was obnoxious.  To suggest that there was no engagement or involvement from the community, is just echoing lazy and uninformed comments you've read online and it couldn't be more removed from the facts. \n\n\n>And can you expound on why the number of validators would need to be lower in Stellar.\n\nThey don't \"need to be lower\", what I said was that the number of validators needed to reach consensus is lower.   The SCP can reach decentralization with significantly fewer validators than a POW blockchain can (for example).  This is due to the difference between how a quorum intersects with other quorums on SCP vs. pure hash rate from miners on a POW blockchain.  This is visually represented here https://stellarbeat.io/quorum-monitor/.   Another benefit to this form of reaching consensus (compared to mining) is that once this process is started and builds momentum, it creates an irreversible decentralized network.  That's much tougher to achieve with mining (in the long term) because losing a handful of top miners can give significantly more power to the remaining top miners.  \n\n>The Stellar Github paints a different story and supports my claim of around 6-7 people maintaining Stellar core.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure how many people at SDF are writing code vs. other business functions.  I'm sure it's more, but I can't answer that's specifically. \n\n\nHopefully, this address any outstanding questions.  I don't think an answer is needed on the final two points, and any discussion would be much broader then the purpose of the initial thread.",

However, if you want to ensure your CAP is implemented in a timely manner, it is likely best for you to attempt to implement it yourself.\n\nOnce a CAP is implemented, a PR should be submitted to update its status to **Implementation Review**, along with the protocol version it was released in if applicable.\n\nFrom here the proposal is brought up again before the protocol group for additional comment, where it is possible that the proposal is rejected based on the issues that arise from its implementation. If no issues arise, it will move to **Implemented** by a CAP team member.\n\n### CAP Finalization\n\nOnce an implemented CAP has been released in a specified version, the CAP should be updated with the protocol version that the implementation targets. From there, once a majority of validators on the network have accepted the implementation, it will move to **Final**.",

Currently you can deposit BTC, ETH, XLM, ADA, DOT USDC, USDT, BUSD, of course also BNB and our CityStates token CSM as well as some others from BSC into the Dashboard. In the Dashboard you can swap these to other currencies but withdrawal to Stellar only supports XLM, USDC and CSM. (on a side note you can also deposit native tokens like ADA, DOT, DOGE etcpp from several other chains to the Dashboard for several months already)\n\nWe applied for a grant in the most recent SCF (Stellar Community Fund) and were not voted for by the Community - and no money means no additional extensive development.\n\nSo yeah, if the community had wanted this, there would be \\~20 other coins anchored and tradeable on Stellar already.\n\n**Before I have to defend this again in the comments:**\n\nWe're obviously not a charity and can throw money at something without knowing what the pay-off will be. I mean... we could but were not willing to take that risk. In my opinion this is exactly something the SCF is for, to open new ventures that can then sustain themselves after initial funding has been made. The proposal was to be able to hire more developers specifically to integrate Stellar deeper into the Dashboard. The current workforce simply doesn't allow for experiments like these as it would take time from projects that actually do make money.\n\nWhile we continue developing on Stellar and still plan to bring more coins as anchors to Stellar, this development is much slower than it would've been possible by winning a grant in the SCF.",

Trading your XLM for yXLM and vice versa, however, would trigger taxable events and any gains would be capital gains, not income.

So it's easier and simpler to created a token on Stellar.\n\nMore details about Stellar Smart Contracts (warning incoming wall of text):\n\nStellar Smart Contracts (aka SSCs) combine transactions with various constraints to achieve an end result. Referencing the Stellar.org SSCs guide, the following are examples of constraints that can be combined to create SSCs:\n\nMultisignature \u2014 Multisig requires multiple parties to sign transactions on an account. You can also assign signature weights and thresholds.\n\nBatching / Atomicity \u2014 Batching is the concept of including multiple operations in a single transaction. Atomicity is the guarantee that given a series of operations, if one operation fails they all fail.\n\nSequence \u2014 Sequences are represented on Stellar via sequence numbers. Sequence numbers can be used to manipulate transactions and guarantee that certain transactions do not succeed if an alternative is submitted.\n\nTime bounds \u2014 Time bounds are limitations on the time period that a transaction is valid and can be used to represent time in a Stellar smart contract.\n\nThis short list of constraints means SSCs are limited in scope when compared to Ethereum smart contracts, but you can still come up with some creative use cases such as escrow contracts, joint entity crowdfunding, lightning channels, and more. You can also write them in the programming language of your choice \u2014 limiting the amount of errors and potential attacks.\n\nAnother key difference between SSCs and Ethereum smart contracts is that the conditions and logic of the smart contract are created separately from Stellar then submitted to the network as a transaction when the end conditions are met. As a participant in a Stellar smart contract you are not directly interacting with code on chain, but instead agreeing to the conditions of a transaction.\n\nFor example, say Alice wants to commission Bob for a piece of art. They come to an agreement that if Bob can finish the art piece in 30 days, Alice will pay him $100, but if it takes longer Alice only has to pay $70. Alice could then use a combination of an escrow account, multi-sig, and/or time-bounds to construct a transaction for both end conditions. Control of the escrow account could then be given to a trusted third party. Once the piece of art is finished, the transaction corresponding to the end condition (was it finished in 30 days or not) is submitted to the network by the trusted party. Bob receives his funds and Alice is only charged for the proper end condition.",

Quantity by comparison is a useless metric here because the consensus algorithms are different. Ethereum uses a Proof of Work algorithm and Stellar uses the Stellar Consensus Protocol. Our first piece of homework is understanding how both of these blockchains reach consensus on the network, then we can better understand that SCP requires significantly fewer nodes than any Proof of Work network, to reach consensus.  There\u2019s other underlying factors such as incentives, scaling operations, and a PoW hashing difficulty that scales according to network hashing power (which doesn\u2019t exist on Stellar).  \n\nNow the second, decentralization. Without understanding the difference between SCP and Ethereum\u2019s PoW consensus algorithms, then there\u2019s no way to understand if a network is truly decentralized. SCP will never be truly decentralized because of how it reaches consensus, no matter the quantity or distribution of validation nodes. Ethereum\u2019s PoW can be decentralized given the percentage of nodes owned by a single entity. Though, ask yourself WHY should it be decentralized and what impact it really has? The most common reason I\u2019ve read is a 51% attack on the network but this is non-sense. We\u2019ve already crossed a point where 51% attacks are irrelevant and don\u2019t have any impact. This is only relevant when a blockchain is young.  \n\nI\u2019m always a student. Please feel free to criticize and debate. I\u2019m all for healthy discussions and I\u2019d love to learn more if I\u2019m wrong on my analysis. If you\u2019d like to chat more reach out.",

Stellar is an infastructure similar to HTTP or the internet protocol which isn't something that is marketer towards us, rather its marketed towards builders/developers as seen with the many partnerships ranging from small businesses to an entire country piloting their CBDC's on the stellar network. How i see it is stellar wants to hit the jackpot of remitances and the global payments markets rather than making marketing campaigns for less significant aspects of the network. I would say its the builders/developers job to market the service built on the network rather than SDF itself. There's probably more to it, but I take the lack of marketing as a good thing since they do alot behind the scenes so its not all bad imo. Since SDF are not for profit, i think it exacerbates the lack of marketing since price performance is not the goal of the project.",

If you have a cryptopunk or an ape means you have the money to spend on them and the fees become irrelevant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I could not find a single example how to programmatically send a Cardano transaction.

Why does Stellar have the 22nd largest market cap, instead of #3 like Cardano, or #7 like Dogecoin? Because those other cryptos have a more effective marketing department.\n\nIMO because there is no community around stellar, there's not much you can do with it, not much you can build around it. If you were to start a bloackchain project from 0 there is no reason to build on stellar unless you are building an anchor (which is a really hard thing to do). It's no accident that avax, solana and terra have gone up dramatically in past weeks. They have the low fees, fast transaction times and smart contracts.",

What's the ETA for mainnet release?\n\nI understand the incentive for LP's, which is earning fees/LP tokens, but what is the incentive for a retail trader to use the AMM instead of the Stellar DEX? Liquidity? As I understand it, the AMM would have to have a 0.3% better spread & slippage (to make up for the fees) to make it a better choice than an equivalent market on the Stellar DEX for a trader. But it seems like if such a difference existed, arbitrage bots would remove it anyway.",

(I'm part of the TangoSwap team) It'll depend on the feedback we get from the beta release.\n\nThe product will have a strong focus on Latin American markets that struggle with currency exchange (such as Argentina and Venezuela), for which we need to redo the informational site and add some very concise information on how to operate in the network, we hope to launch ASAP to be honest!\n\nIndeed trading on the Stellar DEX directly could be better at times, for which I highly recommend [lumenswap.io](https://lumenswap.io), but the comment by /u/sxonz below explains well why this would still be a viable alternative.\n\nIf you look at the volumes of assets in the DEX they are very, very low for a network as strong as Stellar; we hope to change that by giving incentives to liquidity providers.\n\nThank you for your comment!",

                    "response": "> Is such a system possible on Stellar in a trustless way?\n\nI'm not really qualified to answer that but I think this might be more challenging than you expect due to the way the consensus protocol works in Stellar. While you can control what nodes are allowed to join the quorum of validators that validate your token, and make this publicly joinable, you cannot control the quorums of other token issuers. The consequence of this is that you may not be able to form \"trustlines\" between your quorum and the quorums of tokens you'd like to exchange with.\n\nStellar is a hybrid of centralized and decentralized. You are free to create your own decentralized token (allowing public nodes to participate in validation), however, you cannot transact with other tokens whose quorums won't allow it. This mechanism is called a [trustline](https://medium.com/stellar-community/a-guide-to-trustlines-on-stellar-8bc46091a86f) and it introduces some level of centralized authority by giving anchors the ability to trust or exclude participants in their token network. This is quite different from ETH where any token minted is implicitly allowed to transact with any other token, assuming gas fees are paid. Gas fees are important to ETH's architecture as this is how bad behaviour is discouraged when tokens transact with each other, and it's more expensive as more transactions are made because if it wasn't then bad behaviour would be easy/cheap. For example, without gas fees, it would be trivial to create a token that transacts with your token and eats up all your liquidity as it grows larger or more popular than yours.\n\nStellar is cheap to transact mainly because it forgoes this fully decentralized mechanism in order to give token creators more control and authority over the transaction paths allowed. This is why Stellar is \"all about\" these things called \"anchors\" who are essentially trusted entities who act to bring real-world assets onto the network as tokens, and then form trust-lines with each other in order to create cheap transaction paths between each other. For example, I can create an anchor that allows me to tokenize expensive cars, then form trustlines with car dealers around the world to sell those cars at their anchors, but no one else is allowed to sell my cars because I don't allow them to create a trustline with my quorum. This gives me a cheap and trusted way to \"send\" my cars, as tokens, to other parts of the world without all the paper work and disorganization of paper contracts, insecure databases and untrustworthy transaction partners. All I have to do is wait for a token to be sold by a dealer (anchor), package the car and ship it to the dealer (anchor) who then handles the leg work of delivery. If a dealer decides to play dirty with me, steals a car or sells it somewhere that I don't want the car to be sold, then I have the power to cut the trustline with that dealer and they will never again be able to sell my cars.\n\nIn a nutshell, if you want your dPoS idea to work, it will need to either exist in its own network and not care about exchanging with anyone else, or it will need to establish trustlines with other tokens and this can be work to manage.",

With further improvement on UI and API this can be used as a very useful tool on the network.\n\nToken address = https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/asset/GrandCanyon-GDI4PZZ4RE7V23AKWHE2DALYWXEC4BTCUGLUGNJBIR3LZYD2UTNZ7H4D\n\nDirectory Address = https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/account/GDI4PZZ4RE7V23AKWHE2DALYWXEC4BTCUGLUGNJBIR3LZYD2UTNZ7H4D\n\nNFT Address = https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/account/GANVLMYJSQVGPC5JH7I3AL4PPFNP4HIKDVM7LEUQUFXCO54NHKJSZXMD\n\nLegal document address = https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/account/GCVOZCYSGKNXPERX7YNV3M4PQUMMWSK5KRCXRA66ZIR2QTFSJ56YYYXT\n\nAll together this cost less than 2 lumens due to 1.5 being locked into the directory address but you could add multiple NFTs & legal documents to an address so the cost to issue all this only increases by the transaction fees needed. Or to keep it cleaner 1.5 lumens isn\u2019t a bad sacrifice to keep NFTs separate and easier to sort.",

Whether it\u2019s NFTs, transactions from large entities or any other transactions on the chain the validators will always need to upgraded their storage drives all time.\n\nEven AWS have to expand their storage as more people use them. Why would it make a difference if Stellar was able to take a niche of this industry to help increase the networks usefulness. If the stellar validators aren\u2019t taking on these consumers then centralised entities like AWS will take them instead. The network can do it and I\u2019ve provided use cases in another comment.\n\nEvolve with the times. We don\u2019t want to be that network that didn\u2019t look towards the future. Why be like the current banks that aren\u2019t moving forward with blockchain technology and are stuck in their old ways. We don\u2019t want to be left behind while the rest of the industry progresses without us.",

It can only be changed/deleted by me as I have the Secret Key so the Will can\u2019t be tampered with.\n\nHousing sales. The deeds, freehold documentation, energy certificates, property information etc etc can all be uploaded to a single directory and kept track of all in one file directory. Again no tampering can happen to the documents without the secret key access. Linked with a token you could legally do a house purchase over the Stellar Network with USDC, EURT or other assets enabling fast, legal, verifiable house sales all in one blockchain.\n\nCurrently there is next to no bloat on the network when using this method to upload to the network. As previously discussed in protocol discussions the transactions per second could be increased to allow for bloat if that were to ever happen. As it stands this method works very well without causing issues on the network.\n\nWith more testing and stress trials I believe this method could eventually be used for mp3 files and used like the same as methods above to give artists an immutable NFT of their music with documentation alongside it. \n\nThis is crypto and with any blockchain the initial use cases can differ to how a blockchain is used in the future. Yes stellar works great as financial rails and fast, low fee transactions but, just like when the World Wide Web came to existence, products evolve over time. Maybe this could be an evolution for the Stellar Network.",

The blockchain is already extremely bloated (more than 2 tb) and the bloating will continue with introduction of AMMs. You don't need fully synced blockchain to run validator and only large business run (can effort to run) full validators with entire history and in that case few gb more or less won't change anything.

It seems like your version of censorship, based on your post, is that no one can tamper with the files once uploaded. That's more along the lines of security, not censorship. Someone being able to see the contents of the file and determine that it's not in line with their ToS based on subjectivity, that's censorship. Not only would I want secure files but I'd also want censorship resistance. No one can see the file contents except me or who I want to see it. Doesn't seem like this is how your service operates.

Hype is a big mover in crypto, and image is everything. As more banks get into the game, I expect this to change since XLM/XRP really are an enhancement to existing banking infrastructure, but at the same time they do not give those institutions any more power than they already have and in the case of Stellar it does provide an alternative path to managing your money in a decentralized and more self-controlled manner, which makes it a winner for everyone.\n\n(4) Limited \"tokenomics\" for investors. The fact that ETH has moved to PoS makes it attractive for investors because of the ability to \"stake\" tokens. Stellar has no such mechanism, though there are other ways to gain interest on them like crypto banks (BlockFi, Nexo, Ledn, etc).",

I don't know of many coins that have had meetings with either the IMF or Federal Reserve. However it isn't the price I'm concerned with; SDF needs to market to the people if it is to be a coin/currency for the people. You can be the best of the best but if no one knows you exist what are you going to achieve? Nothing. For the last 10+ years crypto has gone in cycles of short bull and long bear markets; We are currently in a bull market which is going to wrap up in a few months and the bear market will last for the next couple years. It would be counter intuitive for SDF to not market at this time; This is the time people are looking and reading about crypto and which coins align with their interests. Admittedly most are looking for the quick profits. I guess imo I would rather SDF public promote Stellar more because I want people to see and understand what this token is and does; If people could just understand that compared to other coins when the time comes and the Federal Reserve (which is losing trust daily) and/or IMF decides to issue a currency on top of stellar; the people will support and trust it already because they've known about it for years.",

                    "response": "Hi all. I finally found my answer. I reached out to the dev that created that analytics blog post and he pointed me in the right direction.\n\nThe [https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/network-activity](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/network-activity) site gives an accurate representation of network activity. For the month of Feb, which had the highest txn volume to-date, there were roughly **28M total transactions.** This dashboard was spun up with the help of the stellar foundation, therefore I believe it to be the most accurate snapshot of network activity. \n\nThe other site, [https://www.statista.com/statistics/730838/number-of-daily-cryptocurrency-transactions-by-type/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/730838/number-of-daily-cryptocurrency-transactions-by-type/), which is the site I often see shared, only shows 5.4M transactions for Feb, and 1.3M for Ethereum network.\n\nNow, according to other sources for Ethereum stats, such as this one [https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/on-chain-metrics/ethereum](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/on-chain-metrics/ethereum), the Ethereum txn volume for Feb was actually \\~36M. \n\n**So, although 28M txn's from Stellar is impressive, it is less than Ethereum's volume of 36M.** The daily active addresses for Ethereum was 680k recently while Stellar was only 53k.\n\nAlso note, according to Stellar Expert, that 96% of all Stellar network volume comes from DEXs. And at the time of writing this, [doge-token.com](https://doge-token.com) is doing the most volume. The second DEX? Another doge token DEX. \n\nThe point of this post wasn't to point out Ethereum traffic, I simply wanted to understand how Stellar compared to Ethereum. Hope this was helpful for others too.",

However, generally and to my knowledge, holding currencies for diversification isn't an considered an investment subject to the same king of regulations as buying stocks, securities, and derivatives. Further, it isn't taxed the same. You can spend currencies in their native region and not realize tax on it. XLM is the same way. We hope to prosper from the value of XLM rising compared to the US dollar. Ideally, in the future I can use XLM to pay for my life and not USD or taxes on using a US CBDC. \n\nEssentially, we hope to profit on XLM through arbitrage. The language matters, as they affect the taxes we pay. \n\nYou right though, the opportunity cost of HODLing XLM is an investment. The dollars converted to XLM, not so much.",

I also felt this way when I jumped in to crypto in 2017.\n\nAs I have learned more about what it (and more specifically Blockchain) can do, I have come to the realization that anyone dropping any amount of money in to it right now can only win. It\u2019s really just a matter of whether you have the patience to be able to sit and watch while it all unfolds or not. People bouncing around between coins don\u2019t have the patience, which is why they are trying to rush their gains forward. They\u2019ll be alright though as long as they see the signs early enough to dump out of nothingburgers and scoop up projects with solid fundamentals that are making big waves.\n\nI think the main reason people feel like they are late, or have missed out entirely is because of BTC\u2019s story. The fact that you could set up an old PC to mine it essentially for free in the beginning, AND actually come out with a decent quantity. AND now for it to have gone from almost zero value to being worth 50 grand a piece....it hurts. It does make you feel like you missed out.

                    "response": "By investing in XLM now, you're essentially getting in on the ground level with early adopters before developers release apps to the retail market bringing in the early majority.\n\nStellar is like windows, MacOS and (possibly more so) Linux which developers are building out an open-source, next-generation decentralized financial ecosystem by seamlessly connecting traditional finance to the global digital network.\n\nTraditional financial systems are in serious need of an upgrade. For example, US legacy banking systems rely on National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) to process bank-to-bank transfers which generally settle within 3 to 4 business days. Current US securities clearing relies on Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) which settles transactions in \u201cT+2\u201d or up to two business days. International money transfers handled by SWIFT are settled within 1 to 5 business days.\n\nStellar can complete those transactions in less than 5 seconds for less than $0.01. Stellar is a fast, efficient network for trading, saving, and spending digital money available to anyone with internet access.\n\nMinimum wallet and trustline balances are 1 XLM and minimum per-transaction fee is 0.00001 XLM. That keeps XLM universally accessible and discourages bad behavior.\n\nAs Stellar's next-generation financial ecosystem grows, XLM locked in wallets and trustlines will grow, as well as XLM used for spending and general transactions. Supply of XLM is fixed at about 50 billion, so as demand for Stellar network increases, so will the price of XLM.\n\nExciting recent developments include:\n\n1. Stellar US Dollar Coin (USDC)\n\nPart of Centre's (Circle and Coinbase) multi-chain USDC framework: it coexists and interoperates with various USDC tokens on other chains, including the original Ethereum USDC token. Transactions for Visa recently began settling using USDC.\n\n2. CP Group, Moneygram and Siam Commerical Bank investing in Lightnet, Bitazza and Velo Protocol (All built on Stellar)\n\nThis is a quiet, yet major disruption in Southeast Asia's remittance market.\n\n3. Ukraine CBDC Agreement with Stellar Development Foundation\n\nThis could immediately increase wallets, trustlines and transactions through spending which would increase demand (supply fixed at about 50 billion).\n\n4. Samsung Stellar SDK\n\nEncourages further development on AndroidOS.\n\n5. Coinbase Reward Card (4% XLM back)\n\nIncreases wallets, trustlines, awareness.\n\n6. DSTOQ\n\nOffering 24/7 stock trading on Stellar. Every new stock, bond, tradable asset added will have 1 XLM minimum requirement.\n\n7. NFTs through Litemint\n\nOpening up a network for artists to trade their work on Stellar and opens a new opportunity for interoperable gaming assets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are all kinds of other developments going on behind the scenes. Stellar Development Foundation is known for not hyping XLM, especially to individual retail investors.\n\nExpect volatility since Stellar is an early network in development. That should stabilize as the network growth and utilization progresses.\n\nHope this helps.",

Use [COINQVEST.](https://coinqvest.com)\n\nIt is a product built on Stellar made solely for businesses and individuals to accept crypto payments. \n\nYou can accept XLM, XRP, BTC, and ETH with their service. It is easy to integrate as well on your website and you can just show them the QR code when they pay you. Do remind them of the MEMO when they pay you lumens.\n\nThey have an in-built tax tool too to track your taxes.\n\nIf you want a Stellar wallet mainly for accepting lumens, use Lobstr. You can then convert your XLM to USDC on the app (to avoid extreme price fluctuations) or keep it in XLM for future appreciation :)",

There is a circulating supply of 22 Billion XLM, so there is the potential for the market to be flooded with XLM at some point, crashing the price. Stellar should distribute those uncirculated coins to XLM holders or burn them out of existence. Then we would see some fireworks in the price. \n\nI recently came back to an exchange wallet i had forgot about. It had about $50 worth of bitcoin in it. I went to send it to my hardware wallet and they wanted HALF my bitcoin as a fee to send it! I thought about it and checked to see if that exchange supported XLM, it did! So I promptly converted the BTC to XLM and then sent that to my hardware wallet almost for free!",

What went down was the public API (called Horizons) which means any organization relying strictly on the *public* service (free to use because SDF provides it) were screwed. However, organizations can run their own Horizons servers, and those who do were unaffected yesterday because the Horizon services are fully decentralized. My Horizons server going down doesn't affect yours.\n\nWhat we witnessed yesterday was that perhaps the SDF should not be offering a free service at all. I think the idea was to help drive adoption by providing it. It is actually not very expensive to run your own Horizons servers though and if you're going to build a business on the Stellar Network, it's in your best interests to run your own.",

Although, there is still room for improvement.\n\nI think if mores nodes were added and the network suffered no impact if a similar event happened; coupled with the burning or distribution of the billions of lumens held by the SDF. People would have less reservations about the stellar network. The SDF is openly working towards these goals. The only issue is how fast they can get there.",

For example, SushiSwap creates a node on Stellar and offers Defi purchases/swaps/staking on the Stellar Dex. Instead of a $100+ transaction charge, it would be a fraction of that, with 100% of fees going to those staking Defi tokens on Stellar. Thus, eliminating the excess part of the charge being received by the ETH miners. You'd also have the option to go to SushiSwap's webpage and convert your Stellar-based Defi tokens to ETH-based. \n\nWith Stellars upcoming Smart Contract capability will this be possible?",

I\u2019m surprised you don\u2019t mention Algorand.    Their model, team and connections are certainly worth noting as competition.   I see Algo as highly performant and they are also clearly aiming to be the winner in this space.    \n\nIf you research the brain trust at MIT and the Fed\u2019s Boston branch office where much work is being conducted on requirements for a Digital Dollar, you\u2019ll find that there are some connections to Algorand.   I suspect that Silvio Micali has good line of site on the requirements and has a good chance of positioning Algorand favorably for meeting those requirements (as they evolve and come into clarity).\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to think about and exciting on both sides.   I hold both XLM and Algo, but am leaning more toward Algorand at this point in time.\n\nDumb?   Why Stellar over Algorand?   \n\nThanks for a great post!",

Here's a TLDR:   \n\n\n>A major focus of that work was expanding SDF\u2019s capacity to host virtual events, which resulted in a total of 20 events (16 in English, 4 in Spanish) throughout the quarter, ranging from webinars, workshops, roundtables, and engineering talks   \n  \n>  \n>SDF also participated in industry events, most notably:   \n>  \n>\u25cf Stellar at Consensus: Distributed   \n>  \n>\u25cf Jed McCaleb at Consensus: Distributed   \n>  \n>\u25cf BlockDown Fireside Chat with Jed McCaleb, moderated by Jay Cassano   \n>  \n>\u25cf BlockDown 2.0 Keynote on Key Management by Denelle Dixon   \n>  \n>\u25cf BlockDown 2.0 Mastermind Panel on Interoperability with Jed McCaleb   \n>  \n>\u25cf Denelle Dixon at Road to TiECon June 2020   \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>In addition to its aggressive efforts on the communications front, SDF executed a series of paid marketing initiatives to further awareness and understanding of the Stellar network. Two speaking appearances at Coindesk\u2019s Consensus Distributed conference were complemented by sponsorship activation within the virtual conference, as well as within Coindesk\u2019s podcast series. Additionally, SDF advertised on the Unchained podcast, hosted by Laura Shin, and has also begun testing the effectiveness of online search and display media. \n\nVibrant is in a small, open Beta. It is not ready for mass advertisement, but when it is, it will be advertised to the target markets. In fact, we are actively seeking out a [Community Evangelist](https://jobs.lever.co/stellar/f45b9f5f-dea6-4242-8d53-e7061218014b) that is boots on the ground in Argentina.",

Stellar\u2019s main goal is to basically have every consumer especially in areas that have no access to banks(such as areas of Africa) with the ability to send and receive money anywhere in the world. \n\nTheir network is far far far faster than many blockchain and the transactions are essentially free since the cost of a move is .000001 lumens or something like that. \n\nThe transactions are actually done in lumens which means the token is always being used unlike ripple for example in which banks just use the network but don\u2019t need the token. \n\nThey\u2019re a non-profit who has a world class team so you know that they\u2019re actually trying to bring a product for the world and not just money. \n\nTheir are also applications built on top of their platform such as DSTOQ which is an investment brokerage app built on stellar so that\u2019s more than just moving fiat from one location. \n\nAside from that they have great partnerships with corporations like IBM. \n\nThey\u2019re a far more about them and their network to show why their utility is different but you can research that in places like cointelegraph as a good source :)",

Erc20 is a smart contract and is still in the process of stabilising and inking out any security loopholes which is inherent with any codes changes made. All these are unnecessary risks baggage that a stablecoin does not need.\n\nAnd lastly, from the past 2 cycles, we know that when prices rises, eth network will slow and fees will increase in fiat terms. These will render stablecoin usage unstable. For stellar, we can safely say that it will remain fairly constant.",

Important additions to the protocol are happening this year, including changes to make it simpler for the sender to add trustlines which is going to have a big impact. Surge pricing was just enabled wallets are finally implementing it. IBM is the frontrunner in launching big services, and has certainly attracted attention to Stellar by doing son.\n\nLast time I sent an erc-20 stablecoin, the minimum fee I could use was 30 cents. I tried lower but it would give me an error because that was the lowest fee possible. Even high surge pricing on Stellar is likely to be fractions of a penny, and full confirmation times should be 5-10 seconds. \n\nThere also is no need to be Stellar Exclusive. Stablecoins can and will be issued on multiple different blockchains and the people will see the differences, and the differences will be big and obvious.",

Also, a lot of these stable coins are a bit weird, where they are often not directly backed by fiat. That does not feel very good. Dai for example has a mechanism that makes it follow the price of a dollar, but it's not backed by real dollars. This mechanism needs smart contracts to function. ",

(They are called Rue, and our blog posts are the first place you can preview any info on that! Pretty rad.)\n\nYou'll also be able to use lots of different cryptos to interact with the game including /r/Stellar Photons. Now you might be thinking \"What? But, we can't get those out of Reddit anymore!\" to which all I can say is \"I can't give everything away in the first blog post!\"\n\nIf you are interested, I hope you follow along with the progress. If you aren't interested, well, that's ok too!\n\nI hope the community at least gets involved in helping us decide on great memes, tropes and cliches of crypto to make fun at along the way :)\n\nThanks for reading!",

DEX markets only work for fungible assets; an orderbook for houses doesn't make sense as houses are of vastly different values. Or god forbid a market for birth certificates! Markets for things that come in fungible non-fractional quantities, like liters of milk, are fine, but those aren't NFTs; they're indivisible assets. The protocols for indivisible assets shouldn't be the same as for non-fungible assets.\n\n**NFTs on the protocol level:**\n\n* For a protocol level implementation, some of proposed advantages have problems:\n   * Trading on the DEX: same problem as using standard assets.\n   * Guaranteed wallet support could be bad. Different classes of NF assets have vastly different contract, regulatory, and transfer-ability needs; a standard interface won't match across classes.\n   * Horizon queries might not make sense for this; the necessary data points for a particular asset class would need customized queries, which would lead to endpoint bloat. Non-coverage problems could be even worse.\n* A protocol level implementation would not be able to anticipate every class of NFTs and their needs, so issuers would likely need to hack the closest supported asset class to get what they need.\n* Overall, I think this isn't a good investment of protocol development resources, especially as it would require very careful protocol-adjacent work for legal needs, etc. See all the work Smartlands has had to do for tokenized securities, and those are fungible.\n* Just thinking about the host of SDK objects for all the different NFT classes makes me shudder.\n* All that said, a CAP could be designed in a totally different way, so some of these problems could be removed.\n\n**NFTs on the SEP level, and particularly as accounts:**\n\n* The flexibility of the SEP level is a good fit here. NTFs would need an accepted general framework but customization in detail; SEPs do that without the locking-in of features that CAPs require.\n* Accounts are designed for ownership customization via the signer features.\n* Ownership of an NFT should be negotiated off-chain, with the current owners able to lock transfer until, for example, a contract is finalized. Holding of signer private keys gives that functionality.\n* Inability to trade on the DEX is a feature we should want, as above.\n* Off-chain metadata has to be a thing for NTFs regardless of implementation. Where is the house, and what are its characteristics? What is the provenance of the art? What are the legal requirements for ownership of whatever it is? Any number of other data types that I haven't thought of?\n\n&#x200B;",

Developers discussed several different approaches, Johan Sten even built a simple framework for NFTs. Some apps have been trying to emulate those tokens. But major wallets do not support those tokens, and they are incompatible with each other. NFT-based games already strive on Ethereum (check the gameplay of \"Gods Unchained\"), Tron even establish a special $100M fund for game developers.I'm personally ok to live without NFTs; I just summed up requests and implementation proposals that have been around for more than a year already.\n\n**There is a huge difference between CAP and SEP process.**\n\n\\- CAP requires significant codebase changes. Everything that is supported on the protocol level requires changing Stellar Core, Horizon, SDKs, documentation, etc. Usually, it's a tremendous amount of work.\n\n\\- SEP is the ecosystem application interopability standard. For example, company A issues new NFT tokens, and they are already compatible with wallet B, and exchange C. SDF does not have to modify a single line of code in Stellar Core to make it work. It's up to application developers to implement it or not. As I mentioned, most wallets do not fully support SEP-0001 (stellar.toml file), and still can safely operate without it.\n\n**Lastly, about the prioritization and implementation.**\n\nI'll prepare all the required documentation and bring this topic to the mailing list and protocol discussion (if the community votes for it). In the case of SEP proposal, the standard may be accepted after a few iterations of discussions on the mailing list and a protocol meeting, so potentially we may have it ready in a month or two.\n\nIn case of CAP, final implementation will likely take more than a year, as there are many high-priority features around.\n\nAs Johan Sten said, not everything has to be initiated by SDF. The community may decide whether some features are important or not. That's the whole point of decentralization.",

My company has been working on a proof of concept NFT collectibles game on stellar for a few months and we\u2019ve been using stellar account as NFTs. They do have the problem of not being able to trade directly on the ledger, lack of wallet support and metadata being meaningless outside the app using it, but we believe with enough popularity of the first product, more devs will follow suit and eventually we can create a standard for stellar NFTs if they publish their games/web apps etc. in our environment.\n\nI'm glad there's been more interest and discussions on NFT's built on stellar as we believe they can become a very integral part of the stellar ecosystem. Aside from a currency/remittance platform, the Stellar ledger is actually capable of so much more in terms of an open and immutable database. One main application which we are tackling now is gaming. Non-fungible Virtual assets and digital collectibles and even game data/progress can have much more intrinsic value when they are provably scarce and players have distributed ownership(can trade/transfer freely), and cross-platform play-ability will allow us to create a universe of previously individually contained games, where players can have full custody of their data. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is not to say that there aren't a few challenges ahead and we're working to solve them and provide a great product that showcases the possibilities of the Stellar ledger. We firmly believe popularizing Stellar NFT's or Stellar Non-Fungible Digital Assets (SNFDA) as we call it, will add even more value to the Stellar ecosystem, and prove XLM's usefulness not just as the native asset of a financial ledger, but also a basic cost standard for decentralized data validation/storage!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks again for bringing this up in the community, I look forward to our future interactions and exchanging some more great ideas!",

That's the beauty of open source. Seems like a good candidate for an SDF grant too? I would still consider very carefully if there is demand for NFTs though. Definitely nice to have but probably low priority.",

It is great getting the story out there, but before doing so there needs to be the right story to tell. Stellar will be the currency of the future and the story needs to portray that. That said it also needs to portray the history of money as well.\n\nStellar reminds me of mid century modern architecture. It holds that sci fi mood that is felt in films such as Gattaca and Minority Report. Classical futurisic presence. This is what needs to be felt when people hear the word Stellar.\n",

I was trying to educate him about the network and how there is an opportunity to build an Anchor in Rwanda and add liquidity to the East African region. \n\nAs far as marketing, communication and business development is concerned. Jed himself has been amazing, as he has always replied the couple of times we have reached out to him. With regards to Interstellar and the SDF. I\u2019m afraid the experience hasn\u2019t been that great. It\u2019s kinda understandable, seeing as we are 12 time zones away, but some response would have been great. \n\nWe\u2019re building on Stellar regardless, as it\u2019s the best technical solution to one of the  problems we want to solve. Pooled collateral for the unbanked. It\u2019s brilliant! \n\nIf Stellar can get their marketing strategy right, there is no doubt XLM will go to de Mars. ",

It's no secret we're [hiring right now](https://jobs.lever.co/stellar) and we're doing so **aggressively**. Obviously adoption of Stellar around the world is our major focus. All our upcoming goals are to further the mission and mandate.\n\nThat being said, even since the comment you referenced, a lot of the content on the website has been updated to be up-to-date with more to find a living home after the new website arrives. To quote some of my [last big reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/ajmmm6/rstellar_daily_chat_friday_january_25_2019/eeykg2z/?context=3):\n\n>If you're interested in what's happening on the development front there are a few places you can follow. Obviously, one of the first places to look is at the [GitHub](https://github.com/stellar) activity. On [Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/stellar.public), active stellar-core development discussion occurs daily in the #core channel and it's been encouraging to see the recent growth in activity across the platform in general. More [clusters](https://www.stellar.org/community/clusters/) are popping up all over and upcoming cluster events will be shared in the newsletter next week (if you're interested in organizing a Cluster, [use this form](https://stellarform.typeform.com/to/g2Ah9P)). Additional information regarding some of the new programs announced in December (stickied above) will also be dropping in the next couple of weeks. Some information has already been updated on the website [here](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe've also updated team and governance pages and have a fancy new little [nonprofit status page](https://stellar.org/about/nonprofit-status) that will have a permanent home in the future. Jed [mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/akup8k/sdf_update/) in the comments of [his last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/akup8k/sdf_update/ef8bljl), that he plans to start having AMAs. We're currently working on getting a cadence for that set up and I personally think that engagement will be really beneficial. Reddit is a large community hub but it definitely misses helping inform people using other channels. Expanding the visibility of these AMAs is also important.\n\nOutside of this, there's new resources and guides coming this year that we know will help bridge that gap between STELLAR OVERVIEW and DOCUMENTATION.  We also want to highlight the work that's happening in the ecosystem. Stellar is the whole of people using it! The big goal is making sure we can direct people to the right places for the right information. So while we're setting up the framework now, the end result will be having consistent communication to help people all over find the answers to the questions they're looking for.\n\n&#x200B;",

The demo page is a super demo, as you didn't care to spend an hour or two to add at least basic content and styles. Ah, and if someone eventually will manage to log into your cool toolbox (Twitter OAuth doesn't work either), he won't be able to buy tokens, as \"Buy\" button **doesn't work**.\n\nEverything looks like a 12-year boy crafted it over the weekend. Do you really want to sell this to someone?\n\n>We have developers all over the world (Germany, Belgium, Wales, U.S. and more) who can help developing individual needs.\n\nThen how about gathering all of them and making a demo that actually works?",

One of the things I hope comes from the upcoming community fund are commissioned technical one pagers and road maps for accomplishing these types of STOs in different regulatory environments to promote the types of micro and macro economies you talk about here. To know the hoops smartlands have gone through would huge. There needs to be no ambiguity or obscurity for people to feel comfortable doing things like this, and I would think it should be straight forward. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly I hope most of the community fund can go to smoothing out the potholes and PR since the road you've laid out here has a pretty clear with a super exciting finish line.

Simply put, it\u2019s too easy to use. Without some nominal barrier or cost, the ledger could become filled with spam or nonsense, or used as a kind of arbitrary database system. These outcomes would defeat the intent behind Stellar: to be a fast, efficient payments system.  \n>  \n>To solve this, we needed to introduce just the slightest bit of friction to deter bad or frivolous actors. Imposing a minimum balance on each account and a very small per-transaction fee were chosen as these deterrent costs. Right now, the minimum balance is 1 lumen and the minimum per-transaction fee is 0.00001 lumen. These are small enough to keep Stellar widely accessible, but big enough to discourage large-scale bad behavior.  \n>  \n>Since Stellar is a universal system for digital money, we could\u2019ve allowed people to pay these costs in dollars, pesos, yuan or anything else. But we felt none of these were appropriate. First, we didn\u2019t want the network to \u201cprefer\u201d any particular national currency\u2014if Stellar used dollars, say, then network prices would stay fixed for Americans but float for everyone else. And, even more, we wanted to create a digital-first asset that embraces the openness of the internet and is independent of economic and political factors.  \n>  \n>So we gave the network its own currency, intended solely for denominating network requirements. That currency is \u201cthe lumen.\u201d As you can see below, there are now 4.3 million Stellar accounts (insertion: currently 6.8 million per stellar.expert), and each of them uses lumens to meet minimum balance requirements and pay transactions fees.  \n>  \n>A natural, pleasant, byproduct of having a network token is that it eases the movement of money between users. Because everyone has and needs lumens, lumens can always be a medium of exchange between otherwise illiquid assets.",

XLM supply was halved a couple of years ago and that could happen again in the future if it\u2019s voted upon. This presumes that they also have identical demand, however.",

It must be a tiny/slow bank if they're limiting it to $2k per customer per day. That's just stupid. Do a little bit of research and find a better closer bank or credit union. I do believe that they'd do research on the deposit. It is a red flag that you did a mobile deposit for a large amount and are immediately withdrawing it. The teller might not have access to the mobile deposited check and would want to verify it. However, 35 minutes is ridiculous. That branch should've also remembered you the second time you came in. Assuming it's not a crazy busy branch.        \nAlso that three days for the check to become available must be over the weekend otherwise that bank is in violation of reg cc and you should report them.",

Easily done.\n\nIf confidence in Lumens was to decrease the central authority would need to sell off the USD or USDC and buy up Lumens. Eventually it would become clear that the authority would be be on the verge of running out of USD and this would lead to a sell frenzy. The authority would have to accept depegging, returning the Lumen to a price determined by supply and demand.\n\nThe only guaranteed way to be completely safe is to have every coin backed by a dollar in reserves.

                    "response": "I believe that Stellar has the highest probability of all cryptos to host the US Dollar. While I will not go through my entire reasoning, here are some bullet points. \n\n-Denelle Dixon, CEO of SDF, travelled with a treasury head and one of the head officers of MasterCard to the IMF conference in 2020. Since, she has appeared multiple times speaking with Treasury officials and they have echoed each other when speaking.\n\n-XLM aims to bring finance to the unbanked. This aligns with governmental interests. Also, the SDF is not for profit. Their chief competitor, Ripple, is for profit and is currently being sued by the government whom has framed Ripple as a greedy organization\n\n-The US Government does not do business with entities that the SEC sued. \n\n-XLM is faster, less expensive, and has more features than its competitors and is ISO20022 compliant. Also, presently, Stellar performs more L1 transactions than every other crypto combined. \n\n-XLM runs IBM\u2019s Worldwire\n\n-XLM\u2019s grab back feature is one of a kind and has been described a \u201ca must have\u201d for a digital dollar by lawmakers. \n\n-Stellar tests their integrity every year in a \u201chackathon.\u201d \n\n-XLM is truely decentralized. Last year, during the hackathon, North American nodes all dropped for several hours. The network stayed up. Afterwards, a patch was created and protocol implemented within days with a unanimous vote. \n\n-XLM is an American invention",

It therefore represents debt which it sells to people to fund the SDF, but it is bought with the idea that it is an investment. You can't say \"who knows why people buy it,\" but then go selling to fund operations and think you don't owe anyone anything. I support the mission, the tech, the ideals of SDF, but it's not a charity.\r  \nI do believe use will create value, but anything unnecessary that hurts price, or anything else that can grow the net worth of the project and therefore grow interest, awareness, etc should be pursued as well.\n\nAlso selling millions of tokens and keeping price down, or doing other things that negatively impact the value, works against their mandate of supporting the growth and development of the network. Hindering those intangible things you get with a valuable network sets Stellar further and further behind an ever more competitive market.\"\n\nI know SDF members cannot and should not talk about price and other speculation but we would really like insights into the exchange sells .\n\nAlso am not sure if we can request more info on what happened with existing acquisitions like chain? and so many other investments made by SDF in lot of businesses?  Are they working? what is the roadmap ?",

                    "response": "Since I was here for the beginning (and the end) of the program I can confirm most of your points. This question also gets asked almost every other week so I think having this post up and answered in detail would help search engines. \n\nWe were the second subreddit to trial the \"community points\" project spearheaded by Reddit throughout 2019 (it started at the end of 2018). The moderator b1tcc took the initiative to help create the application that would be used for the community points project on r/Stellar (b1tcc was not shy from making projects for the community, as he previously took the initiative to create the first free inflation pool service [Lumenaut pool] in the community, which was a huge success given how small the project started; he even was the first one who coined the name 'Lumenaut'). \n\nIf you don't know what community points is, it's basically a points system devoted to subreddits which enable the community to earn points, be interactive with them, create polls with weighted points (meaning the more points the more your voting power matters), and even govern the subreddit in its entirety. \n\nWhat many people are not aware of (or maybe they're not supposed to know), is that Reddit was actually trying to trial the blockchains to see which one was the best suit for their application case. Having faster transactions and low fees is huge for a utility case like this, however, in the end the numbers make sense and if you actually look at the numbers what you see is almost 10 ethereum developers for every 1 stellar developer. If a team of developers pick one blockchain, they're not going to stop halfway just to pick another one (unless they work for the Kin Foundation).\n\nThe decision to use Ethereum didn't suit well for r/Stellar as r/Stellar can't necessarily start using the Ethereum blockchain, for obvious reasons. The pressure to continue the project for the Stellar community was mounting for b1tcc as there wasn't really anyone 'supporting' b1tcc in the end, everyone just expected him to work for free. \n\nThis is just me speculating here but I believe b1tcc saw a huge potential opportunity for Stellar to be used by Reddit and tried their best to get Reddit to use Stellar, but in the end the decision was made in favor of Ethereum. After almost spending 3 years on the subreddit I don't believe b1tcc's leave was 'abrupt'. Obviously they deleted their Reddit account and they didn't a make a \"good bye post\", but it was very clear that the moderator was trying to leave their post as a mod months beforehand (less activity etc), as it was almost 3 years of unpaid volunteer work and what I would describe as a phenomenal act of civil service which will never be forgotten by thousands of Lumenauts they inspired.\n\nThere could be many factors as to why it stopped but to keep the speculation realistic, the end reason was building on the Ethereum blockchain as it was was more lucrative (for every Stellar fan, you have 10 Ethereum fans), and not many people knew Stellar before they already knew Ethereum.\n\nIf you were a developer and you had to pick one project to build on, would you pick the one which has faster transactions and lower fees? Or the one that has 10x more people/money?",

With further improvement on UI and API this can be used as a very useful tool on the network.\n\nToken address = https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/asset/GrandCanyon-GDI4PZZ4RE7V23AKWHE2DALYWXEC4BTCUGLUGNJBIR3LZYD2UTNZ7H4D\n\nDirectory Address = https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/account/GDI4PZZ4RE7V23AKWHE2DALYWXEC4BTCUGLUGNJBIR3LZYD2UTNZ7H4D\n\nNFT Address = https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/account/GANVLMYJSQVGPC5JH7I3AL4PPFNP4HIKDVM7LEUQUFXCO54NHKJSZXMD\n\nLegal document address = https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/account/GCVOZCYSGKNXPERX7YNV3M4PQUMMWSK5KRCXRA66ZIR2QTFSJ56YYYXT\n\nAll together this cost less than 2 lumens due to 1.5 being locked into the directory address but you could add multiple NFTs & legal documents to an address so the cost to issue all this only increases by the transaction fees needed. Or to keep it cleaner 1.5 lumens isn\u2019t a bad sacrifice to keep NFTs separate and easier to sort.",

It can only be changed/deleted by me as I have the Secret Key so the Will can\u2019t be tampered with.\n\nHousing sales. The deeds, freehold documentation, energy certificates, property information etc etc can all be uploaded to a single directory and kept track of all in one file directory. Again no tampering can happen to the documents without the secret key access. Linked with a token you could legally do a house purchase over the Stellar Network with USDC, EURT or other assets enabling fast, legal, verifiable house sales all in one blockchain.\n\nCurrently there is next to no bloat on the network when using this method to upload to the network. As previously discussed in protocol discussions the transactions per second could be increased to allow for bloat if that were to ever happen. As it stands this method works very well without causing issues on the network.\n\nWith more testing and stress trials I believe this method could eventually be used for mp3 files and used like the same as methods above to give artists an immutable NFT of their music with documentation alongside it. \n\nThis is crypto and with any blockchain the initial use cases can differ to how a blockchain is used in the future. Yes stellar works great as financial rails and fast, low fee transactions but, just like when the World Wide Web came to existence, products evolve over time. Maybe this could be an evolution for the Stellar Network.",

The blockchain is already extremely bloated (more than 2 tb) and the bloating will continue with introduction of AMMs. You don't need fully synced blockchain to run validator and only large business run (can effort to run) full validators with entire history and in that case few gb more or less won't change anything.

If the site goes down or the site locks me out, then I can't access anything and the files would just sit there forever inaccessible by anyone. That just seems like a waste of space if that happened.\n\n> The following types of content, or links to this type of content, are not allowed: Pornography, obscenity, racism, violence, pirated programs, or any other illegal activity.\n\nThis greatly contradicts the third point in your post:\n\n> There is no censorship on the blockchain.\n\nApparently there is if I can't upload what I want. It seems like your version of censorship, based on your post, is that no one can tamper with the files once uploaded. That's more along the lines of security, not censorship. Someone being able to see the contents of the file and determine that it's not in line with their ToS based on subjectivity, that's censorship. Not only would I want secure files but I'd also want censorship resistance. No one can see the file contents except me or who I want to see it. Doesn't seem like this is how your service operates.

You can skip the first several minutes while they introduce everyone and cover really basic stuff.\n\nVideo description\n\nBeyond the media hype, the digitization of money is transforming cross border money flows, sovereign monetary authority and the global financial system as we know it. The student-led Strategic Studies Group (SSG) convened a panel with leaders in this space to discuss current developments and explore implications for the future. The webinar was a moderated discussion and included Q&A from the audience. \n\nSpeakers:\n\u2022 Jim Cunha, Senior Vice President of Secure Payments and FinTech, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston; and  head of the U.S. Federal Reserve CBDC project with MIT\n\n\u2022 Denelle Dixon, CEO and Executive Director, Stellar Development Foundation\n\n\u2022 Josh Lipsky, Director, Atlantic Council GeoEconomics Center\n\nModerators:\n\n\u2022 Victor Shih, Ho Miu Lam Chair in China and Pacific Relations, UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy\n\n\u2022 Michael Poor, 2021 MAS-IA Candidate, UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy",

Use [COINQVEST.](https://coinqvest.com)\n\nIt is a product built on Stellar made solely for businesses and individuals to accept crypto payments. \n\nYou can accept XLM, XRP, BTC, and ETH with their service. It is easy to integrate as well on your website and you can just show them the QR code when they pay you. Do remind them of the MEMO when they pay you lumens.\n\nThey have an in-built tax tool too to track your taxes.\n\nIf you want a Stellar wallet mainly for accepting lumens, use Lobstr. You can then convert your XLM to USDC on the app (to avoid extreme price fluctuations) or keep it in XLM for future appreciation :)",

There is a circulating supply of 22 Billion XLM, so there is the potential for the market to be flooded with XLM at some point, crashing the price. Stellar should distribute those uncirculated coins to XLM holders or burn them out of existence. Then we would see some fireworks in the price. \n\nI recently came back to an exchange wallet i had forgot about. It had about $50 worth of bitcoin in it. I went to send it to my hardware wallet and they wanted HALF my bitcoin as a fee to send it! I thought about it and checked to see if that exchange supported XLM, it did! So I promptly converted the BTC to XLM and then sent that to my hardware wallet almost for free!",

What went down was the public API (called Horizons) which means any organization relying strictly on the *public* service (free to use because SDF provides it) were screwed.

My Horizons server going down doesn't affect yours.\n\nWhat we witnessed yesterday was that perhaps the SDF should not be offering a free service at all. I think the idea was to help drive adoption by providing it. It is actually not very expensive to run your own Horizons servers though and if you're going to build a business on the Stellar Network, it's in your best interests to run your own.",

Although, there is still room for improvement.\n\nI think if mores nodes were added and the network suffered no impact if a similar event happened; coupled with the burning or distribution of the billions of lumens held by the SDF. People would have less reservations about the stellar network. The SDF is openly working towards these goals. The only issue is how fast they can get there.",

You then need a third party off ramp (anchor) that you trust to exchange that tokenized asset for the real asset, and vice versa to get fiat onto the network for example. Another barrier is liquidity, without enough volume being exchanged on the SDEX you get a widened spread between bid and ask - so even though the cost of the transaction is negligible the spread may mean you can't buy or sell at the current market price. \n\nIn terms of major cryptocurrencies being added it just needs issuers issuing tokens representing those cryptocurrencies and creating some liquidity around them, note quite a few of the major ones are already on there: BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP. Imo getting some lesser known cryptocurrencies that are pushing to get onto more exchanges could be good a way to expose people to the SDEX - for example I was looking for a quick and easy way to obtain banano recently, if it was tokenized on stellar I would definitely have been using that.\n\nI reckon in the future we will see heavier use of DEXs, just need the anchors and liquidity. Last thing I didn't really mention was marketability and ease of use, everyone knows of Coinbase and if someone is looking for exchanging their bitcoin to ether for example they're not going to be thinking of using something that heavily mentions another crypto (e.g. stellarx). I'd imagine we'd see at some point a company that looks like an exchange but is a pretty UI on top of a DEX + a bunch of anchors",

Here are the problems with the current ecosystem that I have found:\n\n* No on-ramp/off-ramp for mayor currencies (ie Anchors)\n* Low liquidity on the stellar network\n\nMy home country currency has a stablecoin on the stellar network, but the demand for the token is so low that its not even worth considering it to send remittances in it's current state. I literally made money a couple of weeks ago during the spike in prices just because the price for xlm on the  stellar DEX was around $0.2 for that specific pair.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I found that there was no good tutorial for doing the very thing that Stellar is made for\n\nI think you are confusing things, stellar and the stellar network are made for companies, not for individuals. There are plenty of resources on the stellar website to setup a node, create an account, interact with the network, create a token, etc. because thats the target audience.\n\nThe companies who operate on the stellar network are the one that should make the tutorials, infographs, etc about their product (ie sending remittances and payments).\n\nLastly, the volume on the stellar dex is so low that it can't compete yet against transferwise on EUR/USD transactions, for example.\n\nI love stellar, I think it's a great project with TONS of potential.

By doing that they are creating a network around Nano and strong community support.\n\nI am Stellar #1 fan, and I love the work SDF had been doing. However, I have been complaining since 2018 that they should sponsor more community projects for increasing awareness. Additionally, for years only Stellar Desktop wallet was the only serious app you could use. Then Lobstr stepped up and became much better and has been filling that void on mobile (also Trust, which is mostly ethereum, has added also support for XLM, and I personally love Trust and I wish SDF had actually hired devs to build an open source wallet similar to that).\n\nSo I think SDF, while doing great work wstablishing partnerships in different countries and with sifferent organizations, they are dropping the ball aeound marketing, community support, have an amazing wallet app that is the Official app and is built flawless so to gain the best reviews (like Trust).",

Apple and Google pay, while growing fast, are still used nowhere near as much as traditional card payments - and that\u2019s even taking into account that they\u2019re easily interested into existing POS systems. Crypto really needs to find an NFC and/or QR code solution that is cheap and easy for shops to integrate. Not to mention there\u2019s the shop and customer fiat<->crypto on/off ramp hassle and fees (which needs to happen before crypto becomes the standard and makes those redundant). The whole process needs to be cheaper, quicker, and easier than the current card payment systems or it\u2019ll never overtake them. That\u2019s probably why so many cryptos are looking into unbanked regions community as they don\u2019t have to displace existing technology.",

It is their \"Current Supply\" measurement, which they define as the sum of all units visible on the ledger. Specifically, that does include \"burned\" units, at least in all cases I am familiar with. We have discussed adding adjusted supply metrics here. It's something we're considering and I believe such a metric would reflect the impact of the XLM event you referenced in your email.\"",

I\u2019m surprised you don\u2019t mention Algorand.    Their model, team and connections are certainly worth noting as competition.   I see Algo as highly performant and they are also clearly aiming to be the winner in this space.    \n\nIf you research the brain trust at MIT and the Fed\u2019s Boston branch office where much work is being conducted on requirements for a Digital Dollar, you\u2019ll find that there are some connections to Algorand.   I suspect that Silvio Micali has good line of site on the requirements and has a good chance of positioning Algorand favorably for meeting those requirements (as they evolve and come into clarity).\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to think about and exciting on both sides.   I hold both XLM and Algo, but am leaning more toward Algorand at this point in time.\n\nDumb?   Why Stellar over Algorand?   \n\nThanks for a great post!",

I have a feeling this upgraded USDC which already has a market cap in the billions and is growing rapidly will eventually be running large sums of value on the network.",

XLM went to .24 during the same pump (from .08) and is now at .125xx which is still a bit under a 2x increase in value over a 2 mo. period. not sure why 90% of posts on this sub became whiny \"xrp vs xlm, this sucks, xlm won't go up\" type posts, but it's super frustrating - esp. when people inaccurately state xlm's performance as if they weren't even in this space 2 months ago when xlm was worth < .09 cents. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot saying your comment is as bad as a lot of the whining is, but just dropping my 2 cents here. I regularly comment on these types of posts to point out the current price relation to price just a month or two ago (much higher, despite the pullback and XRP FUD). These posts are always upvoted a bunch, and then, after pointing out the inaccuracies of the whiny posts, other users chime in to affirm my refuting of the facts regarding price movement, both for XLM in isolation, and w/ respect to XRP. IMO XRP related talk should just end, as it's not productive, we're not a security, the tech is different, and it just perpetuates confusion and a continuing cycle of \"XRP is dragging us down\" type comments\n\n&#x200B;\n\ndo with you the best in all of your trading, etc. don't take this comment personally",

The problem I believe is...they are all based on nano's seeds words.",

Yeah sure a lot of risk here given what happend to our ugly cousin. Is a high risk high return game. \n\nHoping to see some legit US entity issued fiat or security on the network.

It's working well and closely with governments, international finance orgs, etc. It has the right tech, the right approach to regulation, and most importantly (to me) an ethical commitment to providing low-cost and easy access to financial services with an open-source, decentralized solution. \n\nIt's looking like a slow burn, but as adoption increases so will price and those who decided to speculate on XLM are going to be happy they did so, IMHO.",

I\u00b4m scared as well but I just look at the way it is. If there is no trading for Xrp on the biggest exchanges there is no competitor for Stellar. Stellar is already used way more than Xrp. Lots of people used Xrp for going fast from one exchange to another, now there is just Stellar. When I read stuff like \"leave the sinking ship\" I just think leave the crypto which is most used out of all 2000+ currencies? So just keep calm and think about it.",

Thus allowing partners to immediately dump on the market.\n* Ripple avoids visibility into the above practices.\n\nCompare to SDF:\n\n* No ICO, but has a large printed supply in escrow to fund their organization.\n* Spending funds to developing the network utilization projects/enhance the network. Everything developed leads to token utilization on the network/requires token to utilize.\n* Lack of large scale payouts to the founders\n* SDF does not talk about price and price of token doesn't matter to them. People get angry that they don't talk about price/pump it but it's for a very good reason.\n* SDF provides monetary grants to secure utilization/future network development, but typically in escrowed accounts.\n* SDF provides full accounting visibility to their respective wallets.\n\nTL;DR: SDF has the large printed supply in escrow being used to fund their organization which is a potential vulnerability for regulation, but the XRP lawsuit is a very specific targetted lawsuit towards ripple due to a pattern of sketchy behavior. The main difference i'd highlight is using proceeds from the token to develop solutions that don't require the token, and then making profits from selling those solutions. There is also an aspect that ripple knowingly did the above practices for years after knowing about the potential SEC oriented ramifications.",

The allegation paper clearly maps out how the markets are grossly manipulated when they can be and I would be very surprised if Ripple doesn't eventually implode over this. ?Coinbase has almost no choice but to delist XRP to move their IPO forward. We have seen how, but for unknown reasons, that XLM tokens are priced in a tether like fashion to Ripple tokens. What will happen when XRP finally blows up? I give that a probability about 95%, but these things die slowly. Does anyone know who the  \"Market Maker\" is in the complaint?\n\nTime to decouple.\n\nOver the years, the Stellar Development Foundation keeps pointing the ship and has done a fantastic job in the choppy waters. Now the ship is about to cross a use case tipping point just as another lead boat broke a mast. More uncertain choppy water ahead, unfortunately, but I have confidence this is a very positive Christmas present 2020.\n\nHappy Holidays!",

Nevertheless, I was hopeful about Ripple for a while, until they did the paid speech with Bill Clinton. That created the perception that they were trying to bribe their way out of regulatory oversight or something of that nature. If they were willing to engage in that type of stuff, I knew it was bound to get hit with regulatory issues. Since then, I knew Stellar would eventually take over. Now, I'm absolutely certain over it.  \n\n\nIn defense of Ripple, I do think the SEC is overstepping here and that they simply don't understand how harmful this could be to the industry.

And my comment above is definitely not mean that the FSA of Japan is opposed to the SEC's judgment on XRP. This is just all about \u201cthe definition of securities\u201d in Japan and in the USA are by no means synonymous. \n\nOn top of that, the biggest criterion for whether XRP is considered a security or not may not just be \"sell something to rise capital\" but \"Is the value of XRP linked to the performance of Ripple Inc?\" That makes more sense for me to understand. If all that\u2019s said is \"sell something to raise capital\", a cryptocurrency involved in this securities controversy will extend not only to XRP but also to many cryptocurrencies and crypto industry as a whole, and it may become a tsunami of prosecution after prosecution after setting a precedent for defeating Ripple Inc by the SEC.\n\nIf the value of XRP and the performance of Ripple were linked, then the buyer of XRP was considered to be buying XRP for the purpose of profit from Ripple Inc, and this looks like Ripple Inc. was issuing a \u201cStock Certificate\u201d called XRP. This is exactly one example of a security, in addition to it, the SEC points out that XRP may also violate \u201cInvestment Contract\u201d rules. I\u2019m not familiar with the rules at all but I think the SEC has a wide range of securities concepts than the FSA of Japan in a sense.\n\nHow about in Japan? No, XRP is not a security but just one of cryptocurrencies. Mr. Kitao, CEO of SBI Holdings and director of Ripple in Japan said in his interacting with the FSA, they had stated that they would not consider XRP as a security.\n\nSo, again, that\u2019s why it\u2019s sad that countries have different views on a particular cryptocurrency. This is not really good for the future crypto space we are excited about. And that\u2019s why I would like XRP (I mean the Ripple Inc.) to do its best in this regard against the SEC.",

I think if the SDF takes a wait-and-see approach to the SEC enforcement, that will be a huge mistake. If they win over Ripple (either via lawsuit or a significant settlement), SDF the next obvious target. The biggest issue SDF has is the centralization concern by owning the majority of XLM tokens. They need to reduce this quickly without selling them for profit (which would only make things worse). They need to either burn or airdrop (in 1:1 ratio to current non-SDF wallets) enough XLM so they are much lower than majority control. Ideally, they should get it below 25%. Otherwise, it will cost them a lot more in SEC action and investors in XLM in price depreciation. Thoughts?",

Nothing has come out of it.\n\n- In one of those lawsuits they offered ripple to pay a fine to let SEC go away, they refused, because that would admit guilt and they don\u2019t want that.\n\n-XRP and XLM are global and and US SEC would have a hard time banning it globally if it really get to that point (highly unlikely) other countries like Japan already called XRP not a security.\n\n-Crypto markets are big on manipulation, XRP + Wall Street(banks, hedge funds) + SEC= billions of dollars of possible manipulation?

The altcoin show began 3-5 months later when BTC was going to double the previous ATH. XLM had a run from 0.001 to 0.06 USD and XRP from 0.006 to 0.06 and a few weeks later from 0.06 to 0.45 USD. I know history does not have to be an indicator what is going to happen, but it can be. But it is really obvious that BTC did the same move like the last two halvings. It\u00b4s funny that BTC at 24000 USD is still under the radar for mainstream media while in 2017 it was hype everywhere. We have to wait until it hits 30-50K and the mainstream media starts to bring in the retail investors again.",

It is growing with every year. New use chases like usdc are just around the corner starting in Jan 2021. Stellar is already approved by  New York Financial Regulators and I think they did everything right when it comes to regulations.

Am I correct in saying that if a similar situation occurred on Stellar, the transaction would fail and nothing would happen because the recipient is not accepting (i.e. does not have a trustline for) the token? (Or some sort of path payment might occur, depending on the interface?)\n\nA couple weeks ago, I also saw another guy offering a $10k bounty or something if someone could help him recover $50k of LINK because he accidentally sent it to a smart contract that didn't support it.\n\nAnd these are the people who are supposed to be *good* at crypto--not laypeople!",

BTC is fueled by USDT printing, USDT is not backed by USD but backed by BTC for the most part. Print USDT to buy BTC therefore increasing their reserves allowing for more USDT to be printed and still give the illusion that USDT is backed. Just ask yourself what happens when there is a rush to cash out by selling your BTC knowing that USDT also needs to sell BTC for you to be able to redeem in USD. This is a terrifying cycle and regulations need to come. BTC current price is not a reflection of the market but a reflection of fraud and manipulation.

This is worse! \nI cut my losses and I am telling you! Do it as well and never touch again XRP. \nI completely switched to XLM (i have been invested in XLM before but now, I put the money from XRP in XLM as well).\n\nFOR ALL: Stop dreaming. Take the time and read the SEC-file. I did. You should too! \nIt's not just about that security thing. Topics are that lies regarding use cases and partnerships, selling a shit ton of XRP on the heads of retail investors for their private wealth. \n\nHope at least Garlinghouse, Larsen and his Wife going to jail. At the end of the day we havr to admit, that this was a big fraud! \nRESCUE YOUR MONEY!",

Some hold both, which I did until two days ago. I looked more deeply into the origins of the companies and the missions of both. I think that the mission of XLM seems to reflect the dispositions of those who HODL it. Likewise, some, not all, seem to reflect a different disposition that feels more consistent with the attitudes of the principal owners.  Am I off here? With Jed\u2019s vision for the unbanked and underbanked, providing a way for everyone to have, hold, and exchange income, has that humanitarian aspect of the general cryptoverse. Hoskinson said he didn\u2019t feel the same unifying vibe from Brad and Chris that has brought the origins of cryptocurrency into existence- make the world better. At least that is what I am taking from my further reading and gleaning. I am new to this space, and I am glad I have found it. Yes, I sold my bags of XRP when the bad news hit. Some would say I bailed and only the strong hands will survive. But I have no regrets. The Lumenauts have a disposition that is more in line with my own. I agree that we welcome the new XRP community into the Stellar community with open arms. At least I hope I am picking up in this vibe accurately among XLM hodlers.",

As you can imagine, it\u2019s already this SEC FUD traveled around Japanese crypto markets.\nXRP has already been the markets in Japan for a long time but XLM has just become known in Japan, and there is little information in Japanese. Because of this, it\u2019s easy to relate this XRP issue to XLM for them. I really wish there was a Japanese official information site where they could go to clearly find out the difference between XLM and XRP on this issue for them. \n\n\n\n\nAnd let me end here with a positive news for XLM:\n\n\nGMO Coin (a crypto exchange in Japan) announced that it will start the \"Tsumitate Cryptocurrency Assets\" service. What does it mean is that roughly speaking, you can automatically purchase a fixed amount of crypto assets on a fixed day every month. The service starts on 2021-01-10 and XLM is also supported on the first day.\n\n\n** A little detail: \nWith this monthly auto reserve purchase plan, you can set from a minimum of 1000 JPY to a maximum of 50,000 JPY. So, you can think, super roughly, $10 to $500 range in USD.\n\n\n\u201cTumitate\u201d is definately good for long term investors. (..hopefully)\n\n\nLive Long and Prosper Lumenauts\ud83d\udd96",

I think an article about that will really help with the FUD that is going on in the space as a direct result of the Ripple suit by SEC. I know that you (SDF) normally don't like to talk about the price of XLM and I am not asking you to do that, but rather just  make it clear for people who do not know this stuff in the crypto space. Ripple doesn't need to be mentioned. Just an article that clarifies the situation for Stellar would really help right about now because let's face it: Price Does Matter!",

Ability for ICO\u2019s, Stable Coins, Simplified Smart Contracts, and on and on. Companies who join can choose the other 5 companies they trust which leads to Consensus. Quorum Slices Stellar calls it. Jed- I tip my hat to you for your ability to see ahead. Happy Hollidays everyone. We took one step back but Stellar will bounce two steps forward very soon. I do feel like XRP holders are gonna see XLM has less risk and will flip. Hodl on everyone. Good luck",

Felt really good but wasn't going to trade despite expecting a pullback to .17/.165 or even .15 area.\n\nKeep thinking sellers are exhausted here and can't help but think this dump is misaligned with reality / usecase, etc.\n\nNot one for FUD but do feel kind of silly being scared of taxes and not taking profits closer to .19 after a basically 2x + rise in such a short time. Had plans to take some into BTC or USD if we moved further up into solid mid .20's\n\nNot going to add to the slew of other comments expressing FUD, disappointment, and unrealized losses, b/c that's not my prerogative\n\nWon't try to predict the future but would be pleased, and not totally surprised if we saw some sort of bounce soon. If this wen't under .10 I'd transfer more fiat.\n\nWhat was stupid was throwing some additional chunks of fiat in around .17 despite my very low average cost, feeling that XLM was in fact undervalued within the context of coinbase XLM cash back, likely paypal support, and its general utility, usec ase, and legitimate partnerships.\n\n**In short, if you're new to crypto / alt coins and hopped on XLM recently for one reason or another (be it a well-informed choice or attempting to make quick gains on \"XRP\" #2 - which XLM couldn't be further from actually being - I'd recommend sitting on your hands for a few days instead of selling at a loss and getting potentially left in the dust.**\n\n**There's a lot of forces at play currently in the market, and a greater (localized) # of reasons to be optimistic about XLM.**\n\nHell, even as a basic mechanism of exchange, the speed with which I transferred the bulk of my XLM to a hardware wallet (compared to BTC and even LTC, which I feel is a solid and practically useful crypto - compared to BTC - cannot be beat)\n\nI'm still a few K in the green, so not losing any sleep\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust my 2 cents, good luck all and try to not let emotion and unrealized losses distort your ability to reason and hold out for the *medium* term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit: final thought, looking at the CBpro orderbook scroll right now, can't help but feel sort of bad for those who are still unloading sums > 10K xlm in sells, doesn't seem like a prudent time (after a whole day of rapid dumping) to do so but hopefully I don't eat these words**",

Honestly its so annoying how many ppl think XLM is a fork of XRP or some shit but its understandable as they are so closely correlated. I think thats all we're seeing right now. People who aren't aware of the fundamental difference between the two w XLM being non profit. That being said, there is going to be a huge void to fill as I don't think xrp ever recovers and XLM does pretty much the same thing just better. I purchased at 10c, 15c, and 20c. If I had the money to do it now I'd buy the dip w confidence.  Hopefully I get stimulated before ppl figure it out and XLM goes nuts",

What's probably important to remember is that we just had a double digit correction in the context of a macro bull market. As others said, it's entirely possible that this selloff continues, but I wouldn't place bets that way on the longer timeframe.\n\nLook at the macro. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/MEuIWDzO/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/MEuIWDzO/)\n\nThis pullback represented a 78.6% retracement of the prior move up. The fact that buyers stepped in and defended that support level is bullish, especially if we can get some closes at higher timeframes (1 day or 1 week candles) above it. If you look closely (I'm using 3 day candles), you can also see that this pullback returns to a prior resistance (now support) level we tested in August, then broke through in November. From a technical analysis (TA) point of view, we've got some confluence between 2 major support levels and other indicators like RSI suggesting XLM is oversold on intraday (4hr) timeframes.\n\nPeople will condemn applying TA to alts, but from a TA perspective, it reads like a buy. I say this as someone who has analyzed XLMUSD and XLMBTC pairs for 3 years. I've been wrong before and I'll be wrong again. These are just my thoughts since you asked.",

Jed McCaleb, although not named, is almost certainly the individual referenced as \"co-founder.\" I dont know much about the circumstances around when he left, but on page 9-10 of the lawsuit, it appears to be at least partially due to the fact that he became aware (as of Oct. 2012) that XRP may legally be treated as a security. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, maybe not - just wondering what everyone's thoughts are on that item \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd this will hurt the wallet for a bit, hopefully not for years, but at least you'll qualify for long-term cap gains rates when you cash in right?",

What this means also depends on your own risk assessment.\n\nAre you someone who wanted to hide your crypto holdings? Are you someone who is trying to protect your identity? Well now they technically know where you live and so that information can be constantly re-pasted on the web multiple times making that information public and open to attack potentially *forever*... until the information becomes useless or is incorrect when you move to a new postal address / change your phone number / make a new email address etc.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's information and the main thing that can be done is using it to do more socially engineering attacks on you. They can come tomorrow, they can come next week, they can come next year. They can come for you or a family / friend. It can be very sophisticated or you might catch the first spelling mistake instantly. There is no telling what can happen but the best thing you can right do now is:\n\n>First, never give your 24 secret word key, recovery or secret passphrase to anyone. Never enter it into any app or website and this passphrase should only be inputted into the Ledger device.\n\n>Go onto https://haveibeenpwned.com/ immediately and check if your email was exposed due to the Ledger.com data breach.\n\n>If you receive any postal mail, SMS text-message, emails or even phone calls about your Ledger device, do not act upon it or follow any instructions. Instead, contact Ledger support to confirm if the information you received is a scam. \n\nThere has been multiple accounts of people reporting extortion attempts but all of these are simply scare tactics to take your money. \n\nFinally, don't forget to stay calm and understand that the likelihood of someone actually trying to come to your address is almost zero as that person can't even go outside due to COVID restrictions, as well as who is really going to gamble on trying to go an address to steal their crypto because of information they saw online? When it comes to opportunity cost, there are cheaper and less riskier ways to steal than trying to B&E someone's home on the hopes that you can 'steal their crypto' and everything in the leak is genuine information that hasn't changed.",

However, if you apply critical thinking and do your own research, chances are your crypto will remain in your possession.\n\nAlso, never ever share your private key, and if you have your lumens on an exchange, make sure that exchange account is properly secured with a good password and 2FA. Ideally, get a hardware wallet and store your crypto there. Only then will they truly be yours.",

IMO these should automatically have insurance from the get go. They all seem kinda fishy to me too except for AnchorUSD which is based in the USA.\n\nRight now I am only using AnchorUSD (USD is 7.83% interest) .. Abra offers 10% interest along with the others and they offer higher XLM interest compared to anchorUSD\u2019s 2.79% XLM interest but I just think AnchorUSD is the most trusted of the 4 and I\u2019m only using them. However I am looking into the other 3 and learning more, but not liking the horror stories of accounts compromised and users losing all funds such as on abra",

Abra *earns* interest daily but pays it out weekly. \n\n* AnchorUSD doesn't require moving funds from a trading account to an interest earning account. You just turn on the interest earning option. Abra requires you to move your money into the interest earning account and states that it can take days to move out if you're looking to make a trade. \n\n* Both have a spread when buying/selling. In my experience, AnchorUSD tends to be cheaper. AnchorUSDs spread is almost always around 1.5%, Abras tends to fluctuate above 2%\n\n* Abra provides a bit higher interest (as mentioned) for both US stablecoins and crypto.\n\n* Abra has much higher adoption and is used by many more people. The biggest risk for applications/ business that borrow and lend customer funds is a \"run on the bank\". This essentially happens if too many people try to withdraw funds at the same time and the 'bank' doesn't have enough liquid deposits to fund the orders. This risk is reduced by number of customers/deposits. Abra would have far less risk in this sense.\n\n* Both provide FDIC insurance up to $250k of **non**-interest bear deposits and both offer private insurance on the interest-bearing deposits. The insurance only covers 'hacks' against the companies, if someone hacks your individual account that's on you.",

If that's the case, we will not see below 10 cents again this cycle. We will prob drop a little bit and consolidate for 2-3 months. Prob close to when the USDC goes live, then boom. I do think what I'm seeing could be a bigger picture of that time frame, so consolidation and the next really really big leg up might take a little longer. I could be kidding myself though. \nI shouldn't just post about the charts as we are actually seeing real world use cases being built on stellar now and our future looks good. But the new announcements for the future are aligning with what I think I see.\nAnyone else have thoughts on that? I'm always all ears as I know I could be absolutely wrong here.",

One of the most prominent scams in today's world is the 'phishing' scam (sounds like 'fishing' because the scammer is hoping to catch someone with their 'bait' that they've sent to thousands of people).\n\nPhishing scams can range from being **poorly written messages and copy/pasted websites** to **socially engineered attacks on employees** of companies or individuals of a community. It can be an automated bot trying to target thousands of people or manually done to target an individual. Always be wary.\n\nPhishing scams **work** because of multiple factors, but generally it consists of these main points:\n\n1) **garnering trust** by deception or impersonation\n\n2) **they have directions for you to follow** and do something, like go to this link or **CLICK HERE** or please tell me the \"code\" that comes to your phone\n\n3) **making you act before you have time to think** (the goal of every scam is to get you to **CLICK HERE** as soon as possible)\n \n4) **trying to use your emotions** to have you irrationally act (usually before you think and realize it's a scam)\n\n5) RESPONDING TO UNSOLICITED MESSAGES (don't respond to messages you never intended on getting. Keep in mind, this won't stop a scammer from pretending to be a 'friend' that needs 'help but doesn't have their phone to contact you', nor will your email provider put it in the spam folder automatically).\n\nIndividually they may sound easy to catch, but when you receive an email that utilizes all these points at once, it can almost be impossible to detect it as a scam without taking your time and looking into the details.\n\n6) Another key thing is they already have **your email address, phone number, even name**. In today's world, there's a good chance your information is already sold on the internet due to countless harvesting bots out there. (if you're going to make a personal address, don't put it on your social media or github; make a work address and differentiate it from your personal address, or even make a throwaway address while you're at it)!\n\nThis is also important to understand because there are companies who take your data and then end up losing it to scammers, who end up selling it to darknet markets. **One of the biggest hacks this year** has been the Ledger company where their database full of emails from people subscribing to their website was stolen. To this day, there are people still getting phishing emails from that stolen database.\n\nThough you may be aware of these tips, it's always good to refresh yourself and others with them: https://stellarscam.report/tips\n\nIf there's anything you can take from this post, it's that you should always **verify before acting**. As long as you do that, you should almost never fall into a scam before fully verifying that the service/person you are dealing with is real and before transferring any significant amount. Stay vigilant and be safe!",

If this is the case, you can enter any memo such as \"1234\" with the address and it will work.  AnchorUSD XLM deposit addresses are unique to your account.",

Simply put, it\u2019s too easy to use. Without some nominal barrier or cost, the ledger could become filled with spam or nonsense, or used as a kind of arbitrary database system. These outcomes would defeat the intent behind Stellar: to be a fast, efficient payments system.  \n>  \n>To solve this, we needed to introduce just the slightest bit of friction to deter bad or frivolous actors. Imposing a minimum balance on each account and a very small per-transaction fee were chosen as these deterrent costs. Right now, the minimum balance is 1 lumen and the minimum per-transaction fee is 0.00001 lumen. These are small enough to keep Stellar widely accessible, but big enough to discourage large-scale bad behavior.  \n>  \n>Since Stellar is a universal system for digital money, we could\u2019ve allowed people to pay these costs in dollars, pesos, yuan or anything else. But we felt none of these were appropriate. First, we didn\u2019t want the network to \u201cprefer\u201d any particular national currency\u2014if Stellar used dollars, say, then network prices would stay fixed for Americans but float for everyone else. And, even more, we wanted to create a digital-first asset that embraces the openness of the internet and is independent of economic and political factors.  \n>  \n>So we gave the network its own currency, intended solely for denominating network requirements. That currency is \u201cthe lumen.\u201d As you can see below, there are now 4.3 million Stellar accounts (insertion: currently 6.8 million per stellar.expert), and each of them uses lumens to meet minimum balance requirements and pay transactions fees.  \n>  \n>A natural, pleasant, byproduct of having a network token is that it eases the movement of money between users. Because everyone has and needs lumens, lumens can always be a medium of exchange between otherwise illiquid assets.",

In my opinion, XLM has an admirable use case for remittances and payments for individuals, versus the direction XRP was marketed towards (banks, corporations, large financial entities). It has more of an edge for those less cynically inclined towards macroeconomics (the financial industry), but only if you believe crypto is better used on a micro scale (daily life, person to person). \n\nOn a different (and cynical) note, there is less XLM than XRP in existence, and if both are bought out over time, XLM will have a higher terminal valuation due to scarcity. XLM supply was halved a couple of years ago and that could happen again in the future if it\u2019s voted upon. This presumes that they also have identical demand, however.",

You can easily generate a muxed account with the following tool:\n\n\n\nGo to https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=test\n\nSay you want someone to send to your existing stellar account with the number 1111 attached to it. Well, you enter your address in this tool under \"G address\" and the number 1111 under \"Muxed Account ID\". Click on create and you receive a M address.\n\nIf I then send to that M address, you receive money as if I simply send to your G address, except if you inspect on stellar.expert or lumenscan.io you will find the M address under \"transactions\" instead. This way you can extract the number 1111 with the same tool. \"Get Account from M address\". \n\nSo the muxed account does not exist as an independent account. Millions of muxed accounts are possible and everything will be sent to your main Stellar address. Except you have an identifier with one scan!",

                    "response": "I just tested it out. Solar and Lobstr Wallet read muxed addresses. But TrustWallet does not. TrustWallet is a terrible wallet for XLM. It doesn't even read federation addresses. But theoretically the same could be accomplished with federation addresses. Wirex for example gives you a federation address which auto locks memo. (I only recently found out, I never knew this  was even possible before Wirex...) But most other exchanges have not bothered (must be too much of a mystery and a chore). Anyway, I know that I could easily set up a system based on muxed addresses for a small business. It's really only a few extra lines of programming than the standard memo operation and you don't need a domain. Basically anyone can do it. That's why I can see this taking off, since it's much more intuitive.\n\nBut yes, these things are all just preparing Stellar for mass adoption. Having payments go wrong because of some wrongly filled in memo slows everything down. People will think XLM sucks because they always need to fill an extra field as opposed to other coins. It should be one scan and go. All this will depend on good wallets as well. Rabet (close ties with Lumenswap) is making a new mobile wallet. They already made the best web extension wallet for Stellar. I have high hopes for this team. I hope it will be something like Natrium for Nano. I honestly have no idea why the Stellar Foundation hasn't tried to make their own wallet. Maybe they thought LOBSTR was good enough... First of all, LOBSTR stores your key on server. That's already a red flag. A personal wallet should never upload your keys, no matter how secure they claim to be.",

People out here acting like you did this with a huge team and $1B in VC funding.\n\nFor a v1.0 release, this is great. You\u2019ve created a minimum viable product, put it out there for people to use. Through use and feedback, you can refine it until it becomes a consumer-level product, but all in due time.\n\nOn that note, I\u2019d suggest changing the banner to say \u201cOpen Beta v1.0,\u201d and adding in a feedback form so users can make suggestions. By setting the stage to let early adopters know where you are in the development cycle, all these arm-chair \u201cexperts\u201d will hopefully tone down the non-constructive criticism\u2026",

I walk away from any web based project where the developers themselves don't respect their own work or potential users enough to at least put together an interface that at least looks like it was coded in the current decade. \nI can understand prioritizing functionality, I do all my UI work at the end, but definitely before sharing it with potential users. \nIt's not even that time consuming with all the opensource UI html/css frameworks. \nAny die hard linux-like logic where functionality is the most important thing gets a hard pass as well. \nUI is important. Very, very, very important. Linux had to learn that the hard way, Myspace literally lost specifically because of their interface and today's users are so void of any technical knowledge(sadly tnx to better UI and dumbing everything down to single clicks) that most of the time UI is actually more important than what the product is capable of doing. Case and point...apps on Google Play Store. \nAnyway the website is such a turn off I'm not even going to test it. I didn't start programing, dreaming of once having LCARS like interfaces to see us going beyond that, only to go backwards in time 20 years later, where I am expected to lower my expectations to terminal like experiences. \nI was absolutely drawn in by this description, this is the time where such projects can actually get friction and usage, but just opening that front page...not every \"retro\" look is a hit. Some are hard misses and this is definitely one of them. \nThis can probably be made pleasant in less than a day, so I'm going to save that link and see what happens. Hopefully criticism won't kill anyone's enthusiasm for their work, but will instead make them rethink their design choices or views on the importance of UI, even in early prototype stages.",

Such an annoying label that seems permanently tattooed at this point. \n\nIt's comical considering that the forked Ripple code was completely scrapped **8 years ago**, almost *immediately* after the initial fork. The network went offline, the codebase was thrown out, the consensus was thrown out and Jed, David, and others, built an entirely new chain from the ground up.\n\nWhat's even more funny is that many of the chains built today (almost all of them) are literal forks of the EVM and existing consensus mechanisms, yet none are forever called forks.\n\nStellar is legitimately one of the few blockchains that created its own consensus and codebase from the ground-up.\n\n[End rant]",

It took me a while to understand why there was so much negativity from retail investors about Stellar and its because they are attracted by marketing and the promise of riches. They aren't interested in creating sustainable systems for transparency and equity, they just want to 100X and everytime they pump the coin, the foundation has been able to eat the liquidity injected by the pumpers and reinvest it for long term growth. Brilliant strategy! It will also look good to government regulators who will see a responsible, measured network which has always taken the 100 year view. That is a time horizon best considered in national/international governance.",

It must be a tiny/slow bank if they're limiting it to $2k per customer per day. That's just stupid. Do a little bit of research and find a better closer bank or credit union. I do believe that they'd do research on the deposit. It is a red flag that you did a mobile deposit for a large amount and are immediately withdrawing it. The teller might not have access to the mobile deposited check and would want to verify it. However, 35 minutes is ridiculous. That branch should've also remembered you the second time you came in. Assuming it's not a crazy busy branch.        \nAlso that three days for the check to become available must be over the weekend otherwise that bank is in violation of reg cc and you should report them.",

Got no response at all from these two. \n\nThe investments SDF has done over the past years have been made mainly in companies that don't benefit the ecosystem at all. These companies just take the money but they don't give back anything to the community. For example the Ethereum foundation invested in Uniswap, this was huge since it gave eth more use cases. But what has the stellar ecosystem gained with all the money invested lately? \n\nIt's clear by now that stellar has missed the DeFi train, but I still believe they have to invest in companies that can give back to the community and not just ones that are looking so selfishly to get profit.",

None\n\nSOL had massive transaction volume along with projects built on its network and to me its still a way worse coin than XLM. XLM deserves a top 10 spot by marketcap.",

However, there are massive red flags.  I'm not really directing this at you, but more so towards anyone thinking about getting in, like I was prior to an hour ago.  This is of course, not professional or financial advice.\n\n- It doesn't appear to be tracked on Coinmarketcap, which is pretty weird honestly.  Especially when meme coins get tracked by them within minutes of being released.\n\n- It's circulating supply is 2.3 billion and max supply is 100 billion.  \n\n- So if the circulating supply is ~2% and its value right now is $.018, that pretty much solidifies a massive correction in price, probably upwards of 90%, even with hopeful investors.\n\n- 15% will be airdropped in January of 2022.  Assuming even only 50% of those people are paying attention and get their free coins, that's still a 300% increase to the circulating supply a month from now.\n\n- 22.5% is locked for 3 years.  I suppose it's good that it's locked but in about 33 months, there will be a wild and massive -60% crash again.\n\n- Throughout this entire time, 50% will be rewarded to those providing liquidity. Although that does sound bad and is bad in every technical sense, some of the other DAO's seem to be doing okay.  Well, ish...

                    "response": "u/Turbulent_Chef_9570 Good post, but you made a few mistakes. Here is my take:\n\nFirst, Bitcoin's value proposition trumps any other altcoin. Bitcoin is the TRUE innovator and the ONLY coin that is in its own asset class, there is no other to compete with it. It can be equated to digital energy, digital gold or even a store of time/effort. This has never happened before in modern history. Selling Bitcoin for any other altcoin is like swapping gold in exchange for copper. The fact that Bitcoin NEEDS to be mined with energy is what gives it VALUE. You then transfer BTC and sell it for energy and you just moved any amount of energy instantly anywhere in the world for $2. This is unprecedented.\n\nHence, bitcoin is a store of value, the best one we have at this time in the world. So any \"profits\" have to be moved INTO Bitcoin if you want to keep them and increase them on the long term. The same cannot be said about XLM which is very successful at what it sets out to do, but that is certainly NOT being a store of value.\n\nSecond, XLM excellent design is also its shortcoming for anyone expecting returns like with Bitcoin. XLM has nearly FREE transaction costs, it is NOT mined like Bitcoin and it is instant. This makes for an excellent network to transact on and provide liquidity. Can this increase the price of XLM? Not really, unless it becomes the world exchange medium for transactions.\n\nThird, I disagree that XLM and SDF are not doing a good job at innovating. Them upgrading XLM network with protocol 19 and enabling automated market makers is a statement that SDF is not really useless. On the contrary, the AQUA airdrops and rewards are SDF giving BACK to the community in a way, this is real value, CASH in your pocket.\n\nForth, you made a mistake to think XLM excellent network capabilities will give value to its token. This happens to a certain degree, but nowhere near to Bitcoin which requires real energy to create! XLM is a highly centralized and efficient network. But that is a poor choice if you are after a high return on your investment in XLM tokens.\n\nFifth, XLM is excellent for developers to build on top of it. But it did not innovate to the level ETH smart contracts did, that currently locks over $160 bil in value on the ETH network. This includes Uniswap liquidity and DAI stabecoin among others. XLM tried to provide similar services at almost no gas fees, but the first mover advantage is with ETH, just like BTC is king and in its own class. By comparison, XLM AMM has a total locked value of $60 mil right now. Not too bad for a month since release, but VERY late to this party.\n\nSixth, XLM incentives to use the network were very poor for very long, until now. Yes, the network is fast and almost free to use. So what actually happened was, people sold BTC for XLM, moved XLM instantly and nearly free say to another exchange and then sold XLM back for Bitcoin. What is the added value of XLM besides its instant/free network? Not many reasons to HODL XLM. What is the incentive? The current AQUA rewards is a great start in fixing this. With more incentives and network growth XLM can increase in value too.\n\nSeventh, XLM is highly centralized with less than 50 nodes. If SDF bails and other key nodes stop working, XLM is dead. This will never happen with Bitcoin as it is decentralized and will ALWAYS have incentives to mine it due to its rewards structure. XLM has no such structure, it used to have inflation, but that hardly compares to Bitcoin's innovation which includes proof of work. In this sense, Bitcoin REMAINS superiors to all other altcoins. Proof of stake coins or similar are inferior if you are after \"store of value\". BTC also has huge network value now...\n\nYou blame SDF for doing their job and selling XLM, but XLM was hardly the best choice for long term HODL strategy and store of value. Yes, XLM is an excellent network, great fundamentals, but that does NOT translate in its token increasing in value, at least not currently. That was your mistake. Once crypto goes mainstream, XLM will stand out due to its fundamentals. The token will benefit from it and increase in price, but remember, a high priced XLM token makes its network LESS efficient, cost wise... look at ETH. When ETH was new, gas fees were almost 0 too. Now it is a HUGE problem and it can't scale properly, this again is NOT a problem for Bitcoin, because Bitcoin scales in it's VALUE or price to compensate and it keeps things SIMPLE. Worked great for over 10 years so far.\n\nWhile most look for the next hottest altcoin to buy, they don't see that the true innovation was and remains Bitcoin. The BTC price is proof of that. Remember BTC started with a price of $0.01. It reached $66k this year or almost a 7 million fold increase in price. 1 cent in 2009 is worth $50k today. XLM did not fare that bad either with at 3,000x increase since launch, but hardly a match compared to BTC.\n\nAt the end of the day, feels like you bought XLM at the top or near the top and you barely doubled you cash. :P XLM is not a bad coin really, but perhaps you always wanted to buy Bitcoin and did not know why you should do that instead.",

Banks also lend and make money from interest thus have financial incentive to keep their customers poor so they keep paying fees and interest.  And people don\u2019t really have a choice now because bank account + credit card is the primary way merchants collect payments from customers.  Merchants need to realize that they can accept Stellar assets including USDC online and via QR code in store for less than 1 cent compared to card machine + card for around 2% + .30 cents and it\u2019s actually so easy, even easier than card + card machine. People like to blame the fed for printing all this money but actually they had no choice because banks were abusing fractional reserve and banks/card companies collected 2% of total transaction volume for pretty much the entire last decade that they gained an unfair amount of the total money supply. Just look at bank/card companies profits over the last decade, it\u2019s a fucking joke. The only way to unfuck us was to use the money printer which sadly causes the inflation problems, but now with Stellar and others we can avoid this from ever happening again. Nobody likes working at a bank, they won\u2019t miss their jobs.  Biggest challenge now is KYC, need a way for govt / regulators to identify who owns each wallet, need an easy way to voluntarily offer our personal and business wallet ids for auditing / taxes",

Just a party that distributes whatever token you need, usdc from moneygram for example. Then send that token to whoever, no need for payment processing. The only issue is if stellar blockchain is on Amazon servers. Lol. Yes, it gets rid of everything and after you get some usdc in circulation, you don't even need to withdraw fiat in the future. \n\nSomeone should make a supercut of all the times dixon(?) spoke at the event. \n\nYou are on the right track. All the info is out there. Don't trust us weebs to give you all the accurate info that you need.\n\nPotentially you just need a stellar wallet. No bank, no kyc. Kyc is for gains and stellar actually keeps track of all your swaps. I haven't checked it out but look up an address on stellar chain and all the tax info can be found with lots of math. Lol.",

In most cases, remittances are transfers of money from foreign workers to family members in their home country, sent on a monthly basis. The typical transaction is $200 to $300 and the average retail cost of these transfers runs 7-8%, usually collected in cash. Sending costs can be as high as 15% when transferring money to people in developing economies. \r  \n\r  \nHigh fees to use traditional Money Transfer Operators (MTOs) are often paid by those who can afford it least \u2013 the 1.7 billion unbanked adults in the world. And those costs impact not only the sender and receiver \u2013 they also impact businesses wanting to provide speedy, affordable remittance services to these under-served demographics.\r  \n\r  \nBecause there are so many steps involved in using legacy financial systems and moving value through emerging market economies, costs have remained high. But technology is changing the landscape. Today, remittance service providers, digital money apps, growing fintech companies, and remote traditional banks can use Stellar to reduce the friction and costs associated with traditional MTOs, correspondent banks, and financial payment rails.\n\nOur CEO, Denelle Dixon, did a great job explaining this to congress yesterday during a hearing focused on stable coins.",

While it is true that the SDF are non-profit, the fact that the mainnet is made up of about 23 servers mostly based in the USA and EU makes it kind of pointless to talk about network reslience against political interference. The US government could off-line the whole mainnet, at least temporarily, with a few emails to AWS.\n\n\nIMO, Bitcoin is a much better base token for an actual currency as the network architecture is the only one that is guaranteed to be fully decentralized, fully permission-less and has already proven resilient to a major national political attack (aka China banning it). Stellar is, in my mind, the most cost effect layer-2 solution that not only allows for faster off-chain transactions by tokenizing BTC (e.g. WBTC) but adds all sorts of useful features that make transaction and exchange between BTC and other physical assets faster and cheaper.

You see where I'm going with this with for BTC and ETH.\n\nThe Lightning Network layer-2 solution for BTC speeds it up quite a bit, while retaining the benefit of a fully decentralized and trustless base layer 1. That said, there's no reason LN needs to exist when BTC itself can simply be treated as an asset and tokenized on the Stellar platform, and thus transacted at Stellar speeds with settlement back to the layer 1 BTC chain. It will be interesting to see how all this plays out as inter-chain integration layers start to combine the best of each into single products.",

Transactions are Final.\n\n2. Extremely Low Fees with Bump Fee option. Stellar's fees will always be low $0.000001/TX now, $0.001/TX if stellar reached $100, and $0.01/TX if it were to reach $1,000.\n\n3. Highest Real Volume of all blockchains to date. (A record 39,435,952 TXs on 10 Jan \\`21)\n\n4. Built in Dex. You can trade directly from your wallet or ledger. No need to rely on Centralized Exchanges.\n\n5.Ability for anyone to tokenise any asset. While this can be/is abused it is very important that stellar remains open to everyone for everyone.\n\n6. Payment Paths Say you have USD and want Yen You can utilize payment paths to ensure you get the best value and not just the direct market rate.\n\n7.Send Fiat/XLM/Asset back tokens like email with ability to send xlm like an email or sms message. E.g. Instead of using long blockchain address You can send xlm like User\\*stellar org\n\n8. Built in Anti-Fork; Stellar will not fork, the system will rather halt than fork.\n\n9.Smart Contracts coming soon; Stellar is actively developing Turing complete contracts (like Eth)\n\n10. Ability to follow AML/KYC laws and for tokens to require KYC on wallet.\n\n11. 23/50 Billion total xlm in circulation already; Stellar burnt Half the supply permanently.\n\n12. Fees are no longer re-distributed and inflation disabled making xlm deflationary.\n\n13. Multiple big partners like IBM, Franklin Templeton, Bitbond, and more\n\n14.

And even if it would - people using tether back the asset by investing $ so it is not a bubble, even if there is no security behind it. \n\nIf you buy a fake Rolex watch you still gave the guy selling it to you your money and as long as others buy said Rolex from you with real money that works. If somehow people won\u2018t buy it back from you, the people using tether are the only ones with a problem because they can\u2018t sell anymore, this does not create a bubble big enough to burst a ~3T$ market.",

This is important. \n\nThe reason the language Danelle is concerned about stayed in the bill is because a Republican senator from Mississippi demanded more money for the military in the bill to change that wording and defeated a procedural vote that required unanimous approval in the senate. That vote was 99-1. Congress left the bill unchanged so it would not have to go through the Senate again. \n\nThe treasury department knows the wording is wrong and promised not to enforce the reporting mandate for those that simply run \u201cnodes\u201d or the like. The government isn\u2019t evil. It isn\u2019t a criminal organization (less, perhaps the police and prosecutors at the state and local level). It is corrupt. It is currently flawed. This is why we got bad wording in the law and a no enforcement pledge. The law can be amended, and has the support to be. Relax. We have until 2023 to fix it.\n\nCrypto will be getting regulation. It must get regulation. There is no choice. Private companies are printing money and calling them stablecoins. That cannot happen long term. \n\nStellar will skyrocket from regulation. They need CBDCs to partner with them. Cryptos cannot be allowed to run amuck. Every functional system will collapse if it does. \n\nPush your congressmen and senators to get this right. That\u2019s how this works.",

So when a government decides it wants to implement a regulation like this, it would have made almost every DeFi solution, globally, non-compliant with no way to comply.

If the funds are seasoned for 60 days- we won't even see the deposit. \n\nEx- \nWithdrawal and transfer now (mid Nov) into Bank. \n\nApply for mortgage in Mid January and provide 2 months. PAY close attention to the cycle dates of your bank statements to properly do this.\n\nOR \nIf you have enough money in other assets like 401k/IRA /Stocks with checking and savings. We can use those funds to \"qualify\"  without requiring the borrower to  liquidate it. \n\nThere's more info... so if you want more info about this, comment below",

See [his LinkedIn posts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sethhertlein/detail/recent-activity/shares/) for recent activity.

Recent highlights listed below.\n\nSDF made a [$40M investment in Tala](https://www.stellar.org/blog/tala-joins-the-stellar-ecosystem-to-build-out-digital-banking-capabilities), currently operational in Kenya, Mexico, India, and the Philippines, which aims to provide the unbanked access to financial services that they would not have via traditional means\n\nSDF launched [Stellar Next-Gen](https://www.stellar.org/blog/the-stellar-development-foundation-launches-initiative-to-accelerate-blockchain-education) to establish and develop vital relationships with universities and other educational organizations through courses, events, competitions, and more.\n\nArf, a global stablecoin treasury, working capital financing, and cross-border settlement provider for licensed money service businesses (MSBs), has teamed up with Tempo Payments to introduce a [new payment corridor via the Stellar network from Europe to the Philippines](https://www.stellar.org/blog/arf-and-tempo-launch-new-stellar-based-payments-from-europe-to-the-philippines). \n\nDigital banking leader VersaBank and Canadian blockchain fintech firm Stablecorp plan to commercially launch the [VCAD token \u2013 a Canadian stablecoin](https://www.stellar.org/blog/stablecorp-and-versabank-issue-canadian-stablecoin-vcad-on-stellar) that will be public and live on the Stellar network and the first to be issued by a North American bank.\n\nPerhaps there's too much water in the kettle?\n\nHope this helps!",

If SDF does not plan to market to end users and are only focusing on organizations that are building project using stellar then why does SDF directly sell XLM on exchanges?  Speculators buy these tokens on exchanges and what can they do with XLM in their real life for now? \n\nAs one of the members posted on the daily chat yesterday \n\n\"They created XLM, a thing with value, out of nothing. It therefore represents debt which it sells to people to fund the SDF, but it is bought with the idea that it is an investment. You can't say \"who knows why people buy it,\" but then go selling to fund operations and think you don't owe anyone anything. I support the mission, the tech, the ideals of SDF, but it's not a charity.\r  \nI do believe use will create value, but anything unnecessary that hurts price, or anything else that can grow the net worth of the project and therefore grow interest, awareness, etc should be pursued as well.\n\nAlso selling millions of tokens and keeping price down, or doing other things that negatively impact the value, works against their mandate of supporting the growth and development of the network. Hindering those intangible things you get with a valuable network sets Stellar further and further behind an ever more competitive market.\"\n\nI know SDF members cannot and should not talk about price and other speculation but we would really like insights into the exchange sells .\n\nAlso am not sure if we can request more info on what happened with existing acquisitions like chain? and so many other investments made by SDF in lot of businesses?  Are they working? what is the roadmap ?",

An AMM uses an underlying formula to value two assets relative to one another, and as trades execute against the pool and alter the amount of each asset it contains, the relative prices shift based on that formula.  \nAnyone can provide liquidity by depositing into a liquidity pool \u2014 on Stellar, it will just take a single operation \u2014 and the pool adjusts prices programmatically, so it removes the need to manually update orders to manage risk. When trades execute against a liquidity pool, they incur a small fee, and the pool collects those fees and distributes them to liquidity providers to incentivize deposits.\"\n\nhttps://stellar.org/blog/introducing-automated-market-makers-on-stellar",

An end to the XRP/SEC battle will also mean they stop benefiting from all that free media and as a result you'll see more rivalry between XLM/XRP like it was before the SEC stuff. Maybe that's good, maybe not, it all depends on whether the SDF can pull together more partnerships and exciting advancements compared to Ripple. Having browsed r/ripple for the past year, it's never been about much of anything besides the SEC battle, so I'm not convinced they really have anything in particular to brag about that Stellar doesn't already own bragging rights to. Despite this, I do hold a respectable bag of XRP.\n\nIn short, I'm long term bullish, but it's really hard to read the signs right now. My strategy is to leave my stacks in Nexo (or another crypto bank if you prefer) and collect 7% APY on it. With this strategy, I've just been spreading the fiat around various coins and if one wins and another loses, well that's the gamble we all play. At least I get my 7% APY no matter what.",

We're building out a network where you don't pay the high fees associated with making purchases while traveling internationally.  We've got a few dimensions to this:\n\nmobile to mobile payments (purely software)\n\nmobile to proprietary handheld POS\n\noffline card to software / hardware POS (via NFC)\n\nmobile / offline card to 3rd party POS integration (so we integrate with Revel or Toast POS, etc.)\n\nour value prop is minimal currency spread, operating outside restrictive bank structures cross-border, and eventually a money withdrawal system.  \n\nFor example, when you exchange cash you're paying between 5-27% in fees, markups, and commissions.  When you're even paying with a travel-friendly credit card, you're losing 3-5% on exchange rate markups, plus international purchase fees (if your card isn't travel friendly), and then local fees / markups from the local merchant services.\n\nThen there's parts of the world that don't have an existing or a weak financial infrastructure.  This gives businesses in those areas the ability to get an electronic payment system. \n\nWell aware that there are a ton of others in this space, but we're not looking to overtake anyone (yet), but provide a low cost alternative.  Stellar gives us a lot of benefit over ETH or BTC because of the low fees if at all and because it's not smart-contract based, we just need the basics of wallet to wallet transfer within our network.  \n\nOur focus is purely the travel industry and solving for a lot of these issues that travelers are facing, and we have some benefit of having the industry at a standstill right now.",

Transparency is not 100% consider that you have to deposit a base asset (XLM / BTC / USDC) to receive a synthetic asset (yXLM, yUSDC, yBTC) that you can trade freely although liquidity is an issue still. You better pray they don\u2019t close shop because their products are worth less on the market without the original coin\u2026 You totally skipped the part that about how the base asset is fully under control of UltraStellar since you send it to a wallet they control. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s publicly stated who is borrowing and we do not know who UltraStellar is lending your asset to. Now, I think they are great and can\u2019t wait for Aqua. But to say that UltraStellar is better or different than Nexo/Abra/Voyager would gloss over everything I said. \n\nOn multiple occasions I needed to withdraw large sums of yXLM to XLM I didn\u2019t want to trade it on DEX only to be told that the sending addresses needed to be replenished and they were\u2026.\n\nI have a large amount of XLM so I use yXLM quite a bit. UltraStellar is cool tho I\u2019ll say that.",

The difference between the banking system and stellar is that the user physically sees this difference as a token issued by different entities.\n\nYou will see multiple versions of ALGO offered by different entities, just like chase bank will have chaseUSD or BofAUSD by Bank of America. As I said with stellar you will actually see this difference, whereas this is all hidden in the everyday banking that we use and all we would see are USD regardless.\n\nIn the same way you chose which bank you trust to hold your USD, you need to chose an anchor that you would trust to hold your ALGO and allow you to withdraw when you need to.\n\nFind the domains of the versions of ALGO you might like to use and research if they\u2019re trustworthy or not. This is why Stellar has trustlines to each asset. If you trust the entity, add the trustline and use the asset. If you don\u2019t trust them, then don\u2019t add a trustline and search for a different entity that back that asset instead.",

Think of it the same as being a wrapped token. On Stellar, the tokens can be transferred and traded really fast and cheaply, then the token can be converted back into the desired asset. Anchors are what allow you to convert funds to and from outside of Stellar",

                    "response": "Firstly, anyone can make a token on stellar and call it anything they like, and add it to the SDEX(stellar\u2019s built in exchange for assets on the stellar blockchain). There are a ton of scams that are meant to trick people into thinking they are buying another asset, and they there are a ton of just basically for fun meme and collector coins, like I said anyone can make anything on stellar. That\u2019s why there are so many assets named Algorand to choose from. And after taking a look I don\u2019t think any of the Algo\u2019s on there are legit, I would not personally trade XLM or yXLM for any of them. \n\nThere are some assets you will see on LOBSTR like BTC and ETH that are legit but they are just tokens that are tethered to the real assets. So for example if you look to add the BTC asset with the UltraStellar(creator of LOBSTR) website next to it(there are several BTCs on there as well, most are not legit) you\u2019ll see it has a little blue circle with white up and down arrows, this means the asset is depositable/withdrawable. If it doesn\u2019t have the arrows you cannot withdraw it to anywhere other than another Stellar wallet. So you would add the BTC asset and on the asset page click on deposit BTC, and send BTC to the address it gives you, then your BTC goes to that address, which is just a regular BTC wallet somewhere owned by UltraStellar, and UltraStellar sends you the corresponding amount of the \u2018BTC asset\u2019 that they list. The value will stay the same as real BTC because it\u2019s tethered. Then when you go to withdraw, same thing in reverse. You enter where you want it withdrawn to, and you are really telling UltraStellar to send the BTC they\u2019ve holding for you. \n\nSo in conclusion there are a few non stellar assets you can \u2018store\u2019 in your stellar wallet but they are basically an IOU for the real asset whenever you decide to withdraw it. And there are tons of fakes and copies so beware. The website linked to the assets is for sure the site of whoever made that asset, so just clicking to the sites can help determine if an asset is real or fake. \n\nI don\u2019t fully understand everything myself and idk how clear that explanation is, but am happy to discuss it further if you like.",

Stellar is an infastructure similar to HTTP or the internet protocol which isn't something that is marketer towards us, rather its marketed towards builders/developers as seen with the many partnerships ranging from small businesses to an entire country piloting their CBDC's on the stellar network. How i see it is stellar wants to hit the jackpot of remitances and the global payments markets rather than making marketing campaigns for less significant aspects of the network. I would say its the builders/developers job to market the service built on the network rather than SDF itself. There's probably more to it, but I take the lack of marketing as a good thing since they do alot behind the scenes so its not all bad imo. Since SDF are not for profit, i think it exacerbates the lack of marketing since price performance is not the goal of the project.",

Hell, I'd wager most people have no idea who he is or what he has to do with Stellar.\n\nThat, to me, is one of the biggest missed opportunities. Stellars Cofounder, the man who built the consensus engine, is an award winning Stanford Professor with a PhD from MIT and BS from Harvard. Hes also co-director of Stanford Center for Blockchain Research which is sponsored by both Cardano and Ethereum. He should be the face of Stellar, yet hes completely unknown.\n\nGet out there on some platform/podcast and talk about Stellars properties. Talk about its reasoning for not being turing-complete. Talk about its minimally viable approach to enhancements. Talk about the state of blockchain research. Talk about the vision of Stellars next steps. The guy is a genius and extremely articulate.",

If you were to start a bloackchain project from 0 there is no reason to build on stellar unless you are building an anchor (which is a really hard thing to do).

Ethereum alone probably has dozens of AMM protocols. And that's just AMMs let alone the hundreds of other Defi primitives\n\n3) AMMs are only as useful as the coins available to LPs and there's not any high market (well known) Stellar tokens yet. \n\n4) Money talks. The AMM TVL is growing fast but its still a spec of dust when compared to the multiple billions on other chains. StellarX currently has about ~$40 million locked in defi which is currently 0.01% of the total crypto TVL.",

We're building out a network where you don't pay the high fees associated with making purchases while traveling internationally.  We've got a few dimensions to this:\n\nmobile to mobile payments (purely software)\n\nmobile to proprietary handheld POS\n\noffline card to software / hardware POS (via NFC)\n\nmobile / offline card to 3rd party POS integration (so we integrate with Revel or Toast POS, etc.)\n\nour value prop is minimal currency spread, operating outside restrictive bank structures cross-border, and eventually a money withdrawal system.  \n\nFor example, when you exchange cash you're paying between 5-27% in fees, markups, and commissions.  When you're even paying with a travel-friendly credit card, you're losing 3-5% on exchange rate markups, plus international purchase fees (if your card isn't travel friendly), and then local fees / markups from the local merchant services.\n\nThen there's parts of the world that don't have an existing or a weak financial infrastructure.  This gives businesses in those areas the ability to get an electronic payment system. \n\nWell aware that there are a ton of others in this space, but we're not looking to overtake anyone (yet), but provide a low cost alternative.  Stellar gives us a lot of benefit over ETH or BTC because of the low fees if at all and because it's not smart-contract based, we just need the basics of wallet to wallet transfer within our network.  \n\nOur focus is purely the travel industry and solving for a lot of these issues that travelers are facing, and we have some benefit of having the industry at a standstill right now.",

ForEx and remittances are controlled in many places by dinosaurs so that's a good niche. I may have got the wrong end of the stick but would you be working alongside the current XLM based network of redeemable stablecoins? If so I can see how your app can avoid dwelling on the crypto and XLM thing entirely and let the user choose their base currency. Good luck deciding where to compete and where to cooperate!",

The difference between the banking system and stellar is that the user physically sees this difference as a token issued by different entities.\n\nYou will see multiple versions of ALGO offered by different entities, just like chase bank will have chaseUSD or BofAUSD by Bank of America. As I said with stellar you will actually see this difference, whereas this is all hidden in the everyday banking that we use and all we would see are USD regardless.\n\nIn the same way you chose which bank you trust to hold your USD, you need to chose an anchor that you would trust to hold your ALGO and allow you to withdraw when you need to.\n\nFind the domains of the versions of ALGO you might like to use and research if they\u2019re trustworthy or not. This is why Stellar has trustlines to each asset. If you trust the entity, add the trustline and use the asset. If you don\u2019t trust them, then don\u2019t add a trustline and search for a different entity that back that asset instead.",

                    "response": "Firstly, anyone can make a token on stellar and call it anything they like, and add it to the SDEX(stellar\u2019s built in exchange for assets on the stellar blockchain). There are a ton of scams that are meant to trick people into thinking they are buying another asset, and they there are a ton of just basically for fun meme and collector coins, like I said anyone can make anything on stellar. That\u2019s why there are so many assets named Algorand to choose from. And after taking a look I don\u2019t think any of the Algo\u2019s on there are legit, I would not personally trade XLM or yXLM for any of them. \n\nThere are some assets you will see on LOBSTR like BTC and ETH that are legit but they are just tokens that are tethered to the real assets. So for example if you look to add the BTC asset with the UltraStellar(creator of LOBSTR) website next to it(there are several BTCs on there as well, most are not legit) you\u2019ll see it has a little blue circle with white up and down arrows, this means the asset is depositable/withdrawable. If it doesn\u2019t have the arrows you cannot withdraw it to anywhere other than another Stellar wallet. So you would add the BTC asset and on the asset page click on deposit BTC, and send BTC to the address it gives you, then your BTC goes to that address, which is just a regular BTC wallet somewhere owned by UltraStellar, and UltraStellar sends you the corresponding amount of the \u2018BTC asset\u2019 that they list. The value will stay the same as real BTC because it\u2019s tethered. Then when you go to withdraw, same thing in reverse. You enter where you want it withdrawn to, and you are really telling UltraStellar to send the BTC they\u2019ve holding for you. \n\nSo in conclusion there are a few non stellar assets you can \u2018store\u2019 in your stellar wallet but they are basically an IOU for the real asset whenever you decide to withdraw it. And there are tons of fakes and copies so beware. The website linked to the assets is for sure the site of whoever made that asset, so just clicking to the sites can help determine if an asset is real or fake. \n\nI don\u2019t fully understand everything myself and idk how clear that explanation is, but am happy to discuss it further if you like.",

Paypal has a special merchant account that costs actual money and they take a cut of every transaction. I've heard stories of people trying to run business through personal accounts and having their accounts locked until they sign up for merchant accounts. And if that merchant wants to receive a USD stablecoin without all the fees, they have only a few options.\n\nFocusing on the convenience you already enjoy via Venmo and whatever emphasizes that maybe you aren't the target demographic at this time. You might as well say you don't understand the purpose of crutches because you have functioning legs. (Not a dig, just a silly, extreme example). Stellar has a purpose, but it's just not one you need with your present circumstances.\n\nBut as for physical locations, yes, they are lacking.  At this time, they are trying to support and enhance existing infrastructure and provide the tools for startups to enter the space...not necessarily build their own infrastructure yet or even interface directly to customers like you and me.  So at this time, it looks like stablecoins that interface with ACH/wire with traditional banks...but there are movements for more user-facing products...such as the leaked info about the possible Moneygram acquisition...or Velo Labs potentially using 7/11s as an on/off-ramp. I believe Tempo has physical locations, too, in Europe.\n\nEdit: Also, with regards to your Mexico example\n\n[https://www.stellar.org/case-studies/saldo](https://www.stellar.org/case-studies/saldo)\n\n>Using Saldo\u2019s interface, a sender selects a recipient\u2019s utility provider and account, chooses the amount they want to pay, and hits send  \n>  \n>With a click of the button on the app, people can instantly pay their utilities bills. Family members no longer have to take the extra step of going to a remittance provider in-person to receive the money for their bills.  \n\n\n[https://saldo.mx/index\\_en.html](https://saldo.mx/index_en.html)",

I think you have the right idea, but yeah, right now the network is missing the anchors it needs to make the vision a reality. I was under the impression the idea was to make cross border money transfer easier and cheaper. Sure, right now it is relatively easy with internet access, but it is definitely not cheap. Won't stellar solve that issue, even for internet users?",

Haven't checked for this year. It's increasingly popular in Europe mainly because you can exchange currencies on it and pay with that currency in the country for low fees. But it's not trustless, it's very much centralized, and fees for buying crypto for example are fairly high. \n\nIMO there is a market for it and institutions will be more likely to adopt XLM than XRP mainly because of transparency.",

This uses the SEP-24 function on the Stellar Network to correctly Deposit & Withdraw directly with Ultra Stellar.\n\n[https://www.notion.so/Convert-asset-to-yield-generating-asset-1-1-in-different-Stellar-wallets-8ed8d34aafff479d91b01399bf57b78f](https://www.notion.so/Convert-asset-to-yield-generating-asset-1-1-in-different-Stellar-wallets-8ed8d34aafff479d91b01399bf57b78f)\n\nSwaps indeed work well as long as the liquidity is on the SDEX to allow for it. Unfortunately only \"buying yXLM\", or in the SEP-24 definition Depositing for yXLM, is liquid on SDEX as Ultra Stellar account [GAVPJ.....W4R555](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/account/GAVPJ7GEFWIM7MOI2RUIMX5MV7PVK4W2OZQJVYNJXX6YNR2VXJW4R555) is able to provide a sale of 1yXLM for 1 XLM on the network.\n\nUltra Stellar is unable to provide the same service in reverse as a buy order on their behalf would be at 0.9999999 XLM for 1 yXLM so not a true 1:1 conversion. This is why SEP-24 Deposit & Withdraws are recommended as this is the only way Ultra Stellar can guarantee a 1:1 conversion by their services.\n\nUsing swap at the time of writing this:\n\n211,515 yXLM can be purchased 1:1 before the 1:1 no longer holds true.\n\n0 yXLM can be sold 1:1 before the 1:1 no longer holds true.\n\nHere is the yXLM/XLM market as viewed by StellarTerm. Just scroll down to view the order book of the yXLM/XLM market.\n\n[https://stellarterm.com/exchange/yXLM-ultrastellar.com/XLM-native](https://stellarterm.com/exchange/yXLM-ultrastellar.com/XLM-native)\n\nIt's important to check this order book before swaps are made as there may not be enough liquidity at a decent price to fulfill the swap correctly.\n\nEven a small sale to 7500 XLM will cause slippage of 5 XLM as 7505 yXLM is needed to get 7500 XLM back.\n\nAs I have suggested before in this article\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/n141i0/how\\_to\\_get\\_yxlm\\_sep24\\_deposit\\_guide\\_on\\_lobstr\\_and/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/n141i0/how_to_get_yxlm_sep24_deposit_guide_on_lobstr_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nIt's a bit more complicated to do the sep-24 deposit but you will get 1:1 always or you can choose to do swaps and not have to worry about addresses, memos, and possibly messing up but it may come at a price.",

This is because exchanges usually only use one or a few accounts for receiving deposits, and they need a way to distinguish one user\u2019s deposit from another. Not including a memo in such cases may result in lost funds. If you are sending funds to an exchange outside the Blockchain.com Wallet, be sure to check whether the exchange requires you to include a memo. If so, the exchange will provide it.\"\n\nIn this specific case, I'm talking about this part of the XLM deposit step of acquiring yXLM: https://ultrastellar.com/assets/yxlm",

Like Coinbase it has an easy interface for even beginner crypto users so is a lot more friendly.\n\nStellarTerm is simple in layout but has a few more uses that more advanced users can take advantage of to really use the power of the SDEX.\n\nStellarX can be compared to Coinbase Pro. A more advanced interface and control over SDEX options but is more limited in tokens available as specifics need to be met to be added to the product.\n\nCollectively these give users options on how much interaction they want with the network so whether you\u2019re a beginner or hardened veteran of the Stellar Network, Ultra Stellar has an option for you.",

In this operating model, the malware is created by the ransomware developer, while the ransomware affiliate is responsible for infecting the target computer system and negotiating the ransom payment with the victim organisation. This new businessmodel has revolutionised ransomware, opening it up to those who do not have the technical capability to create malware, but are willing and able to infiltrate a target organisation.*\n\n...\n\n*Following the money*\n\n*Using Elliptic\u2019s blockchain analytics we can follow the ransom payments and see where the bitcoins are being spent or exchanged. What we find is that the majority of the funds are being sent to cryptoasset exchanges, where they can be swapped for other cryptoassets, or fiat currency.*\n\n*The majority of cryptoasset exchanges comply with anti money laundering regulations. They verify their customers\u2019 identity and report suspicious activity. They also use blockchain analytics tools such as those offered by Elliptic, to check customer deposits for links to illicit activity such as ransomware.*\n\n*However some jurisdictions do not enforce these regulations, and it is to exchanges in these locations that much of the DarkSide ransomware proceeds are being sent.

The official answer is that 3rd party services will appear to anonymize payments and obscure balances but the reality is it makes personal day to day banking a weak use case. Where blockchain shines are things that Stellar is focused on providing, ease of exchange, asset investment and fast value transfer for business. \n\nThe alternative approach is Monero and other \"privacy coins\" but various regulators are already getting wise to the difference and blacklisting exchanges who touch them. In my opinion there is going to be a future regulatory focus where they whitelist things like Stellar they can monitor and go after anything which is privacy based.",

FWIW there was a side chain project to bring privacy to Stellar but not sure where it is at. My guess is its going to be difficult as no matter how good the privacy is in-between  a & b account you are still going to have x going out of a into b which can be analyzed like they do with Tor.

In that sense, your XLM is probably more private since it would be impossible to distinguish what's yours just from the wallet address.\n\nIMO, in practice, you're unlikely to be \"outed\" for a big wallet.

It'll come from some random address you've never seen  before. Transactions are public, so anyone can see that your wallet received an incoming transaction and then make their own with a scam memo text. The memo field is a free text field and people can put whatever they want in it. \n\nIf you received it at the same time of your exchange transfer, a bot is monitoring the exchange's hot wallet for outgoing transactions and then sending the scam transaction to the receiving address at the same time. That's damn clever and you almost fell for it cause you went as far as to visit their website. In the future, ignore incoming memo fields altogether.",

User A can send User B dollar tokens or lumens or whatever. But Stellar also allows a user to send one currency and have the recipient receive *another*. Essentially, you can send and exchange money in a single atomic transaction.\u00a0\n\n  \nThis is called a *path payment*. It\u2019s a powerful innovation for international payments; for example, an American company can pay an invoice in Mexico by spending dollar tokens, while the vendor receives peso tokens. Neither side incurs exchange risk or delays. Both sides get only the currency they want.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\u00a0\n\n* The sender in the U.S. holds dollar tokens and signals to the network they want to send peso tokens to the vendor.\n* The network searches through the decentralized exchange described above and finds the best price for the sender.\n* The network locks in the prices and amounts.\n* The sender confirms the transaction and the dollar tokens leave their account.\n* The transaction executes and the recipient gets the peso tokens. The payment is atomic and submitted to the network as a single transaction. Neither side can get \u201ccaught in the middle\u201d and hold tokens they don\u2019t want.\n\nAbove, the sender in the U.S. doesn\u2019t have to hold pesos just for their payments to Mexico. The recipient in Mexico doesn't receive dollars they then have to sell for pesos. Neither side has to manually convert; Stellar automatically finds the best conversion rate. Path payments are the fulfillment of Stellar\u2019s interoperability promise: value flows seamlessly from account to account, in whatever form is most useful.",

I see the 8% as part of the risk and really an investment in them since they run a stable coin that doesn't increase in value. \n\nKracken seems to be the most secure I've found and they don't offer insurance at all.",

I have a ledger nano and can still log into the stellar account viewer wallet without an issue. When you say it doesn't recognize it, do you mean it brings you to an empty wallet? Or do you mean it simply doesn't recognize your actual device? If it is the second scenario, go into the stellar options on the ledger nano itself and makes sure you have the browser permission options properly set. I didn't log into mine for a couple years and had no problem hooking it up the other day and accessing my wallet. \n\nAlso...are you trying to do it with internet explorer? If so, try again with either google chrome, firefox, or brave browser.  I seem to recall having a problem using internet explorer a long time ago.",

The SDF has a good reputation in my opinion and I don't think they would knowingly allow anchor usd to operate while trying to scam users or take their funds. I had an issue this past week with anchor usd and its difficult to get customer support, however they finally got back to me and the issue has been resolved. So far im happy and I am treating anchor usd as my savings account while I earn 7.8 % interest.",

It's my morning activity over coffee these days. Getting rich slowly! \n\nWhat I'd like to see rather than interest paid is actual staking as a service for the various assets listed, at least those that actually do POS. In some instances, the staking % is higher than the interest paid. \n\nI would also like to be able to deposit some of the assets listed. For example, I have some Tezos I'd like to deposit from another wallet but it doesn't seem to allow for deposits at this point.\n\nLastly, the Stellar Dex is missing. I'd wish they would include some exchange functionality. Maybe in future.",

At this point people have to cash out their holdings to an exchange, trade for something else and redeposit.

When cryptocurrency finally arrives, all of this will be handled by some company building a product on top of the network.  In the same way that paypal manages all the backend accounting when you buy goods or services with a linked bank account, the same can also be built using Stellar as the payment rails.  The end user doesn't even need to know what Stellar is to be transacting on it.\n\n>Single withdrawal point: an Anchor that issued a credit is the only entity that can redeem the said credit \n\nThis is only because the system currently lacks high-end anchors.  There is a lot of risk in accepting (\"redeeming\") ptblazer's USD pegged coin, but imagine if a major bank or central bank issued a USD pegged stable coin.  Suddenly it's not as risky.",

If no issues arise, it will move to **Implemented** by a CAP team member.\n\n### CAP Finalization\n\nOnce an implemented CAP has been released in a specified version, the CAP should be updated with the protocol version that the implementation targets. From there, once a majority of validators on the network have accepted the implementation, it will move to **Final**.",

Some questions that got to me: \n\n- I think this assumes that people don't spend XLM because they are afraid it will gain in value? Where would you spend XLM now if it had a stable value? Don't you think we should have more places to spend it first before this is a problem? \n\n- If there would be a way to reward spending that would be amazing. I always like how PayPal did that. They rewarded people paying with it and rewarded merchants accepting it. I think it would help if SDF would have a way to track the purchase of goods/services via Stellar, they could then provide discounts on them. Would need some monitoring for gaming though. Imagine being able to pay with Lumens at a 5% discount, while getting a bonus if you refer a merchant that starts accepting Lumens. For example sdf could give wirex customers that pay with xlm a 5% cashback, while giving merchants that receive the payment 1%. Both could have a max per person.\nWhat do you think?",

If it goes up, the way I understand it they just pay you 7%  based on the original USD amount. \n\nNot sure I fully understand, but if that were the case, I am not sure the SEC or FTC would let this ride.

Every app will create a new account for each of their users. Whenever they want to interact with that account, for login, moving assets, making trades or payments, etc. they will send an xdr request to the address they have on file for you. Much like how 2FA works where you add an account by scanning a QR code or entering a code you will have accepted ownership of this account from the app earlier and will now receive transaction requests from that app for the account they created for you. If at any point you're done with that app or would like to revoke their access you'd just remove the account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven StellarAuth itself will use this method for adding devices to your profile. In order to add a new device you'll have to authorize the addition from another StellarAuth account you already control. StellarAuth will send an xdr transaction signifying a device addition that if signed would add that device to your profile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's pretty cool actually!",

Is that right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf so that will definitely be possible with StellarAuth in the future but your use case will honestly be better solved with a tool like Lobstr Vault. They already support multisig coordination amongst other Lobstr Vault accounts and they're targeting Stellar as a high level service where StellarAuth will be targeting application use. B2B vs B2C. StellarAuth won't be a traditional wallet or account viewer in that sense, you won't necessarily even know Stellar is involved. Users won't be sending transactions or originating actions. It really will be visually and functionally similar to a 2FA application, just with more broad use cases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope that helps! Great question.",

This enables you to send Fiat near instantly around the world instead of having to wait for multiple banks to send each other messages that tell them to update their balances. Someone should tokenize this fiat (1 token = 1 USD for example). Tempo does this for EUR, Stronghold does this, among others, for USD. Because they use tokenized fiat, they can offer instant, almost free transfer of value.I myself used Tempo to withdraw money in the philipines at 0 cost from an ATM, this saved me 12$ every transaction. In the background Tempo created EUR tokens that were exchanged to PHP tokens, which I could use to take out cash from the ATM.\n2. You can do that yes. But selling XLM into fiat costs time and money normally. By using an \"anchor\" like tempo, you get a much smoother, cheaper and faster experience.\n3. I don't know about US to EU directly, maybe others know? You could ask Tempo about it, they respond to emails quite good. In the meantime you can probably buy EURT with XLM (contact tempo), these can be send to someone in Europe at almost 0 cost. This would leave you with the process of buying XLM, I don't know what the cost + time is for that in the US.\n\nThe overall experience is improving at a rapid pace. I think in a short while this will be much more automated (eur to php already is really fast and easy for example). ",

(What good is crypto if you can\u2019t spend it?)\n\nSo middlemen offer solutions to these problems. World Wire lowers fees and increases speed for tradition remittances. Tempo offers additional options. And there are products that are rethinking remittances altogether, like SureRemit, which offers gift cards/vouchers that can be redeemed at local area businesses instead of fiat. \n\nhttps://medium.com/@IkishanShah/sureremit-a-platform-for-non-cash-remittance-across-the-world-4280cbe9953",

DEX markets only work for fungible assets; an orderbook for houses doesn't make sense as houses are of vastly different values. Or god forbid a market for birth certificates! Markets for things that come in fungible non-fractional quantities, like liters of milk, are fine, but those aren't NFTs; they're indivisible assets. The protocols for indivisible assets shouldn't be the same as for non-fungible assets.\n\n**NFTs on the protocol level:**\n\n* For a protocol level implementation, some of proposed advantages have problems:\n   * Trading on the DEX: same problem as using standard assets.\n   * Guaranteed wallet support could be bad. Different classes of NF assets have vastly different contract, regulatory, and transfer-ability needs; a standard interface won't match across classes.\n   * Horizon queries might not make sense for this; the necessary data points for a particular asset class would need customized queries, which would lead to endpoint bloat. Non-coverage problems could be even worse.\n* A protocol level implementation would not be able to anticipate every class of NFTs and their needs, so issuers would likely need to hack the closest supported asset class to get what they need.\n* Overall, I think this isn't a good investment of protocol development resources, especially as it would require very careful protocol-adjacent work for legal needs, etc. See all the work Smartlands has had to do for tokenized securities, and those are fungible.\n* Just thinking about the host of SDK objects for all the different NFT classes makes me shudder.\n* All that said, a CAP could be designed in a totally different way, so some of these problems could be removed.\n\n**NFTs on the SEP level, and particularly as accounts:**\n\n* The flexibility of the SEP level is a good fit here. NTFs would need an accepted general framework but customization in detail; SEPs do that without the locking-in of features that CAPs require.\n* Accounts are designed for ownership customization via the signer features.\n* Ownership of an NFT should be negotiated off-chain, with the current owners able to lock transfer until, for example, a contract is finalized. Holding of signer private keys gives that functionality.\n* Inability to trade on the DEX is a feature we should want, as above.\n* Off-chain metadata has to be a thing for NTFs regardless of implementation. Where is the house, and what are its characteristics? What is the provenance of the art? What are the legal requirements for ownership of whatever it is? Any number of other data types that I haven't thought of?\n\n&#x200B;",

Developers discussed several different approaches, Johan Sten even built a simple framework for NFTs. Some apps have been trying to emulate those tokens. But major wallets do not support those tokens, and they are incompatible with each other. NFT-based games already strive on Ethereum (check the gameplay of \"Gods Unchained\"), Tron even establish a special $100M fund for game developers.I'm personally ok to live without NFTs; I just summed up requests and implementation proposals that have been around for more than a year already.\n\n**There is a huge difference between CAP and SEP process.**\n\n\\- CAP requires significant codebase changes. Everything that is supported on the protocol level requires changing Stellar Core, Horizon, SDKs, documentation, etc. Usually, it's a tremendous amount of work.\n\n\\- SEP is the ecosystem application interopability standard. For example, company A issues new NFT tokens, and they are already compatible with wallet B, and exchange C. SDF does not have to modify a single line of code in Stellar Core to make it work. It's up to application developers to implement it or not. As I mentioned, most wallets do not fully support SEP-0001 (stellar.toml file), and still can safely operate without it.\n\n**Lastly, about the prioritization and implementation.**\n\nI'll prepare all the required documentation and bring this topic to the mailing list and protocol discussion (if the community votes for it). In the case of SEP proposal, the standard may be accepted after a few iterations of discussions on the mailing list and a protocol meeting, so potentially we may have it ready in a month or two.\n\nIn case of CAP, final implementation will likely take more than a year, as there are many high-priority features around.\n\nAs Johan Sten said, not everything has to be initiated by SDF. The community may decide whether some features are important or not. That's the whole point of decentralization.",

My company has been working on a proof of concept NFT collectibles game on stellar for a few months and we\u2019ve been using stellar account as NFTs. They do have the problem of not being able to trade directly on the ledger, lack of wallet support and metadata being meaningless outside the app using it, but we believe with enough popularity of the first product, more devs will follow suit and eventually we can create a standard for stellar NFTs if they publish their games/web apps etc. in our environment.\n\nI'm glad there's been more interest and discussions on NFT's built on stellar as we believe they can become a very integral part of the stellar ecosystem. Aside from a currency/remittance platform, the Stellar ledger is actually capable of so much more in terms of an open and immutable database. One main application which we are tackling now is gaming. Non-fungible Virtual assets and digital collectibles and even game data/progress can have much more intrinsic value when they are provably scarce and players have distributed ownership(can trade/transfer freely), and cross-platform play-ability will allow us to create a universe of previously individually contained games, where players can have full custody of their data. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is not to say that there aren't a few challenges ahead and we're working to solve them and provide a great product that showcases the possibilities of the Stellar ledger. We firmly believe popularizing Stellar NFT's or Stellar Non-Fungible Digital Assets (SNFDA) as we call it, will add even more value to the Stellar ecosystem, and prove XLM's usefulness not just as the native asset of a financial ledger, but also a basic cost standard for decentralized data validation/storage!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks again for bringing this up in the community, I look forward to our future interactions and exchanging some more great ideas!",

And then goes into foreclosure on double-wide, which, one night while his family is trying to make ends meet by collecting earth worms under the moonlight, a repo man comes and takes his trailer and Eddies family comes home to an empty lot and have to live in a homeless shelter.  All because you told him that crypto was on sale and should bring hihh returns very soon!\n\nBut seriously, encourage friends and family to do their own research.  Dont push them into spending money they may not get back or they will forever see you as \"that guy\".",

I want to launch this in the Stellar Community for April Fools and if anyone is curious on working to improve the UI or UX and launch it for April Fools feel free to message me :D \n\nThis is where the work will continue: [https://github.com/Stellar-Quest-Lumenauts/hot-potato](https://github.com/Stellar-Quest-Lumenauts/hot-potato)\n\nThe Project will be licensed under the MIT License, and will remain that forever.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProject Pitch: [https://devpost.com/software/hot-potato](https://devpost.com/software/hot-potato) \n\n\"The inspiration was to create a collaborative experiment for the Stellar community, similar to those experiments like Reddit's for April Fools. The question was how to involve the community and blockchain. I found this idea of passing an object from one player to another fun, and the visualizations and data science you can incorporate are interesting.\n\nHot Potato is an NFT contract with a web interface to make it simple for those who aren't familiar with the Stellar Laboratory. It uses a web server in this case fastify and generates an XDR based on two cases. If the asset isn't minted it will mint it for the user, otherwise it will facilitate a transfer using the orderbook to transfer the asset. Trades also help for visualizing the transfers, by making it simple to query the Horizon API and recursively searching for next candidates.\r  \n\r  \nThe contract is basic and it has basic error handling, the goal is to make it as simple as possible so even a beginner can use.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4fNesho",

Blockchains are good at censorship resistance.  That's it. That happens to make them good for creating digital assets, and durable ledgers, but you could have had digital collectibles and tokens before there were blockchains.\n\nPeople didn't take digital goods seriously before blockchain, because records could get lost or mutated.  But there's certainly no good reason for a government or corporation to force you to use a blockchain against your will.  In fact the opposite is true, they are good for interactions that are both permanent and can't be controlled by other authorities.  So this distopian shit makes zero sense to me.\n\nI don't get why people think blockchains are about surveillance, some private version of a panopticon.  The internet already made that possible.  Blockchains are about things we **voluntarily** share, mostly for tracking artificial money and tokens.  They are not for tracking people but things.  Keys are inherently not tied to an identity, but an ability to perform a cryptographic signature.  Yes, you can often do chain analysis and such, but that's not the point.",

I wouldn't expect the greater crypto community to know about it yet because there's nothing they can do with it. \n\nAMMs are only a few days old and the SDF tweeted and wrote articles about it almost daily for the past few months.

If SDF does not plan to market to end users and are only focusing on organizations that are building project using stellar then why does SDF directly sell XLM on exchanges?  Speculators buy these tokens on exchanges and what can they do with XLM in their real life for now? \n\nAs one of the members posted on the daily chat yesterday \n\n\"They created XLM, a thing with value, out of nothing. It therefore represents debt which it sells to people to fund the SDF, but it is bought with the idea that it is an investment. You can't say \"who knows why people buy it,\" but then go selling to fund operations and think you don't owe anyone anything. I support the mission, the tech, the ideals of SDF, but it's not a charity.\r  \nI do believe use will create value, but anything unnecessary that hurts price, or anything else that can grow the net worth of the project and therefore grow interest, awareness, etc should be pursued as well.\n\nAlso selling millions of tokens and keeping price down, or doing other things that negatively impact the value, works against their mandate of supporting the growth and development of the network. Hindering those intangible things you get with a valuable network sets Stellar further and further behind an ever more competitive market.\"\n\nI know SDF members cannot and should not talk about price and other speculation but we would really like insights into the exchange sells .\n\nAlso am not sure if we can request more info on what happened with existing acquisitions like chain? and so many other investments made by SDF in lot of businesses?  Are they working? what is the roadmap ?",

Stellar is an infastructure similar to HTTP or the internet protocol which isn't something that is marketer towards us, rather its marketed towards builders/developers as seen with the many partnerships ranging from small businesses to an entire country piloting their CBDC's on the stellar network. How i see it is stellar wants to hit the jackpot of remitances and the global payments markets rather than making marketing campaigns for less significant aspects of the network. I would say its the builders/developers job to market the service built on the network rather than SDF itself. There's probably more to it, but I take the lack of marketing as a good thing since they do alot behind the scenes so its not all bad imo. Since SDF are not for profit, i think it exacerbates the lack of marketing since price performance is not the goal of the project.",

No DeFi protocols either so why would they jump on this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Why should someone pay $1,000 in fees to Opensea, when they can use Stellar to create an NFT for pennies at StellarNFT.com?\n\nNFT are status symbols. If you have a cryptopunk or an ape means you have the money to spend on them and the fees become irrelevant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I could not find a single example how to programmatically send a Cardano transaction.

Why does Stellar have the 22nd largest market cap, instead of #3 like Cardano, or #7 like Dogecoin? Because those other cryptos have a more effective marketing department.\n\nIMO because there is no community around stellar, there's not much you can do with it, not much you can build around it. If you were to start a bloackchain project from 0 there is no reason to build on stellar unless you are building an anchor (which is a really hard thing to do). It's no accident that avax, solana and terra have gone up dramatically in past weeks. They have the low fees, fast transaction times and smart contracts.",

                    "response": "A DEX is built into Stellar. It is a global orderbook where you can bid or ask any asset against any other asset where it is authorized by the asset issuer. Soon, it will have a Uniswap v2-style automated market maker and liquidity pools. This will also be built into the protocol.\n\nAn oracle is relied on by smart contracts to use some outside information that can't be found on the blockchain/ledger. Stellar doesn't have smart contracts like that at this time, so there is no possibility for oracles, nor is there a possibility for anything to make use of an oracle. For some purposes, Kelp Bot can use price feeds from centralized sources to automatically make ideal orderbook entries.\n\nI'm not sure what a starter platform would be, but it's pretty easy to use the Horizon API with basic HTTP knowledge in your preferred developer environment. You could use Stellar Quest to learn about the different transactions you can do on Stellar. Stellar makes an SDK available for a few popular environments.\n\nLitemint markets itself as an NFT platform where you can issue the lowest possible denomination of a Stellar asset, thereby creating somewhat of a \"nonfungible token\". It is not like ERC-721 nonfungible tokens because there is no way to tell the difference between two units of the same token. I.e., with ERC-721, I can own Cryptopunk #104 and Cryptopunk #301, but with a Litemint NFT, I own 1 or more Cryptopunks.\n\nI don't know what \"IDO\" refers to. A quick search shows \"Initial DEX offering.\" Since Stellar has a built-in orderbook (SDEX), you can offer any asset at any price in any other asset you like. You could use Kelp Bot, a bot for the SDEX, to automatically set prices and make the market where there is none. You could manually watch the order book and take bids if buyers are highly interested in an asset.",

Stellar is really fast and cheap\n\n2. TSS is the perfect smart contract engine. It keeps smart contract processing off-chain (which means it's way faster and cheaper), and allows you to code your smart contracts in normal programming languages. \n\n3. Stellar was built to support real-world assets. We want our DeFi protocols to allow someone to borrow Nairias by depositing their Apple shares as collateral. That's what a truly open financial ecosystem would mean. Stellar currently allows us to enable that.",

The issue is it's really difficult to collateralize them on a blockchain since you need to have some way to represent and value the collateral on the blockchain.

That kind of organization probably won't exist for the next few years, but once they do we'll definitely integrate with them to support micro-lending, mortgages, etc.",

Ethereum-Virtual-Machine  based DeFi protocols are suuuppperrrr expensive. It's going to cost you over $50 to deposit money in any lending protocol on Ethereum, and that's just going to get more expensive. I expect our fees to always be less than 1 cent. Additionally, Stellar is set up better to support real-world financial assets like stocks and bonds. The value of DeFi is in supporting these asset classes. DeFi protocols built on Ethereum probably won't be able to support them nearly as well as we can.\n\nTo answer your second question:\n\nMaybe? It's a very weird situation in that blockchain removes the need for a lot of the tasks that existing financial institutions perform to create value. For instance, a banks core functionality is validating that money exists in different accounts and moving it around. Blockchain does all this without the massive corporation. So I expect financial services to try to move into blockchain, but a lot of them will probably find that their core competencies aren't relevant anymore.",

                            "response": "Oracles are pretty weird in TSS land. To generate a valid transaction when you run a txFunction(TSS smart contract), you have to ensure that each turret running the contract has the same inputs. So if a txFunction is making price data API calls that influence the transaction being generated, each turret running the txFunction must receive the same response from the API provider. This is further complicated because turrets can't communicate with each other so they can't verify that they all got the same response.\n\nWe need price feed for our protocols, so our temporary solution is to add a timestamp input to the txFunctions that need prices, then turrets use the timestamp in their API call to request price data at that timestamp. Our txFunctions pull a price from Coinbase and Binance, average the price they receive, then sanity check that price with the dex price. With this system, we can reasonably guarantee that the price will be accurate and also consistent between turrets.\n\nA longer-term solution we're considering is adding a second layer of Turing signing servers that just make API calls and serve as oracles for the network. txFunctions would pull prices from a few different Oracle turrets, exclude any outlier responses, and then average the remaining ones. This is somewhat similar to what chainlink does for the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. I'm still unsure if this is actually better than the solution we're currently rolling with, but it's an idea we're kicking around.\n\nHopefully that answers your question!",

Actually happy to see it dip a bit from time to time, gives me the chances to buy. I don't know why, but I have a certain feeling that Stellar will be one of the most commonly used coins, and that and that Stellar will with time rise absurdly high in %. \n\nI'd hold on, I'd keep buying, and I'd keep doing what you're doing. Great post!  \nBest of luck Stellarbeings! Love to you all! Remember the moon is ours, and beyond!",

It is more realistic to involve a separate account (it can be created on the fly too). I will update the documentation and example to reflect these but in the meantime, here is some explanation:\n\nThe goal is to provide and on-chain proof that the NFT creator had ownership of the parent tokens at creation time. To do so, the transaction that creates the NFT includes payment operations involving these tokens.\n\nAnyone reading the transaction can verify on-chain that the creator had ownership of the parent tokens (again provided that the destination account is not \"self\" in which case browsing effects is needed to check the actual balances because the Stellar protocol does not check balances in self payments).\n\nHope this helps, I will update the documentation with a full example.\n\nCurrent reference implementation can be found here: [https://github.com/litemint/litemint/blob/7b447686e3b57c1328322ed33bce377edd42f493/js/core/network.js#L427](https://github.com/litemint/litemint/blob/7b447686e3b57c1328322ed33bce377edd42f493/js/core/network.js#L427)",

DEX markets only work for fungible assets; an orderbook for houses doesn't make sense as houses are of vastly different values. Or god forbid a market for birth certificates! Markets for things that come in fungible non-fractional quantities, like liters of milk, are fine, but those aren't NFTs; they're indivisible assets. The protocols for indivisible assets shouldn't be the same as for non-fungible assets.\n\n**NFTs on the protocol level:**\n\n* For a protocol level implementation, some of proposed advantages have problems:\n   * Trading on the DEX: same problem as using standard assets.\n   * Guaranteed wallet support could be bad. Different classes of NF assets have vastly different contract, regulatory, and transfer-ability needs; a standard interface won't match across classes.\n   * Horizon queries might not make sense for this; the necessary data points for a particular asset class would need customized queries, which would lead to endpoint bloat. Non-coverage problems could be even worse.\n* A protocol level implementation would not be able to anticipate every class of NFTs and their needs, so issuers would likely need to hack the closest supported asset class to get what they need.\n* Overall, I think this isn't a good investment of protocol development resources, especially as it would require very careful protocol-adjacent work for legal needs, etc. See all the work Smartlands has had to do for tokenized securities, and those are fungible.\n* Just thinking about the host of SDK objects for all the different NFT classes makes me shudder.\n* All that said, a CAP could be designed in a totally different way, so some of these problems could be removed.\n\n**NFTs on the SEP level, and particularly as accounts:**\n\n* The flexibility of the SEP level is a good fit here. NTFs would need an accepted general framework but customization in detail; SEPs do that without the locking-in of features that CAPs require.\n* Accounts are designed for ownership customization via the signer features.\n* Ownership of an NFT should be negotiated off-chain, with the current owners able to lock transfer until, for example, a contract is finalized. Holding of signer private keys gives that functionality.\n* Inability to trade on the DEX is a feature we should want, as above.\n* Off-chain metadata has to be a thing for NTFs regardless of implementation. Where is the house, and what are its characteristics? What is the provenance of the art? What are the legal requirements for ownership of whatever it is? Any number of other data types that I haven't thought of?\n\n&#x200B;",

Developers discussed several different approaches, Johan Sten even built a simple framework for NFTs. Some apps have been trying to emulate those tokens. But major wallets do not support those tokens, and they are incompatible with each other. NFT-based games already strive on Ethereum (check the gameplay of \"Gods Unchained\"), Tron even establish a special $100M fund for game developers.I'm personally ok to live without NFTs; I just summed up requests and implementation proposals that have been around for more than a year already.\n\n**There is a huge difference between CAP and SEP process.**\n\n\\- CAP requires significant codebase changes. Everything that is supported on the protocol level requires changing Stellar Core, Horizon, SDKs, documentation, etc. Usually, it's a tremendous amount of work.\n\n\\- SEP is the ecosystem application interopability standard. For example, company A issues new NFT tokens, and they are already compatible with wallet B, and exchange C. SDF does not have to modify a single line of code in Stellar Core to make it work. It's up to application developers to implement it or not. As I mentioned, most wallets do not fully support SEP-0001 (stellar.toml file), and still can safely operate without it.\n\n**Lastly, about the prioritization and implementation.**\n\nI'll prepare all the required documentation and bring this topic to the mailing list and protocol discussion (if the community votes for it). In the case of SEP proposal, the standard may be accepted after a few iterations of discussions on the mailing list and a protocol meeting, so potentially we may have it ready in a month or two.\n\nIn case of CAP, final implementation will likely take more than a year, as there are many high-priority features around.\n\nAs Johan Sten said, not everything has to be initiated by SDF. The community may decide whether some features are important or not. That's the whole point of decentralization.",

My company has been working on a proof of concept NFT collectibles game on stellar for a few months and we\u2019ve been using stellar account as NFTs. They do have the problem of not being able to trade directly on the ledger, lack of wallet support and metadata being meaningless outside the app using it, but we believe with enough popularity of the first product, more devs will follow suit and eventually we can create a standard for stellar NFTs if they publish their games/web apps etc. in our environment.\n\nI'm glad there's been more interest and discussions on NFT's built on stellar as we believe they can become a very integral part of the stellar ecosystem. Aside from a currency/remittance platform, the Stellar ledger is actually capable of so much more in terms of an open and immutable database. One main application which we are tackling now is gaming. Non-fungible Virtual assets and digital collectibles and even game data/progress can have much more intrinsic value when they are provably scarce and players have distributed ownership(can trade/transfer freely), and cross-platform play-ability will allow us to create a universe of previously individually contained games, where players can have full custody of their data. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is not to say that there aren't a few challenges ahead and we're working to solve them and provide a great product that showcases the possibilities of the Stellar ledger. We firmly believe popularizing Stellar NFT's or Stellar Non-Fungible Digital Assets (SNFDA) as we call it, will add even more value to the Stellar ecosystem, and prove XLM's usefulness not just as the native asset of a financial ledger, but also a basic cost standard for decentralized data validation/storage!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks again for bringing this up in the community, I look forward to our future interactions and exchanging some more great ideas!",

Thank you!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think SDF and the community has done a decent job on the technical front in being accessible and having thorough guides, but what I wonder is if there needs to be more guidance in overcoming regulation. One of the things I hope comes from the upcoming community fund are commissioned technical one pagers and road maps for accomplishing these types of STOs in different regulatory environments to promote the types of micro and macro economies you talk about here. To know the hoops smartlands have gone through would huge. There needs to be no ambiguity or obscurity for people to feel comfortable doing things like this, and I would think it should be straight forward. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly I hope most of the community fund can go to smoothing out the potholes and PR since the road you've laid out here has a pretty clear with a super exciting finish line. Fascinating times for sure. ",

Some insiders told me to hodl my Lumens I bought recently because there are great news coming till the end of the year (maybe much sooner) and it looks like this is just the begining. Stellar might be the first blockchain tech company to actually spread blockchain usage around the world. There where some very interesting stuff on the test network yesturday. As soon as the Bitcoin bears start spreading FUD around 17/12 (CME Futures manipulations filling up their pockets for the end of the year), I excpect to see massive funds coming on Stellar Lumens. The rocket on their logo will take a totally different meaning at that point ;)\n\nPS: This is just personnal opinion and if you don't do your own research, it's better for you to stop trading or investing because you risk to loose your money.
