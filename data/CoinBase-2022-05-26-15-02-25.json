I have no idea if they will continue to support WLUNA, or if anyone would be willing to buy the now-completely-useless WLUNA / LUNC coins.\n\nAnd coinbase has not announced support for Terra 2.0.\n\nAnd coinbase has not announced if WLUNA will become WLUNC.\n\nAnd coinbase has not announced if WLUNA will be allowed to trade again after the snapshot.\n\nAnd coinbase isn't going to give you any answers here. They will announce via twitter.",
