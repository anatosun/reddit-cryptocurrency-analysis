But MoE and SoV are just qualities that sound money needs to have. They do not address competition between currencies.\n\nI think the fallacy is the idea that you can successfully compete with the dollar by being \u201cbetter\u201d than the dollar in some way. But fiat currencies don\u2019t compete on value or quality. Fiat currencies have value because citizens are forced to pay taxes with fiat, and this incentivized (forces) them to trade things of value for fiat dollars.\n\nSo IMO, any crypto has to have a use case that cannot be performed with fiat online. (I think for BCH, this is tipping.) \n\nIf you try to compete by being better than fiat on its own turf, you run into the \u201cbad money drives good money off the market\u201d problem.\n\nOne more thing- people often make the argument, \u201cWhy would you spend bitcoin when it could 10x next year?\u201d But in the next breath, they say, \u201c..and why would someone accept it when it might plunge?\u201d I think the issue is basically that volatility adds an element of speculation to normal buying and selling. I actually don\u2019t see that as a real problem- people will choose whatever is optimal for them, and the trade can still happen.",

I think BTC is not useful for exchange, but BCH is not valued by most people. I think people use Monero for the same reason they pay taxes in dollars- necessity.\n\nI don\u2019t think having a million merchants add BitPay actually increases demand for BCH. If each purchase gets immediately converted to dollars, it\u2019s basically just more sell pressure.",

I know that my question had included portions of honest inquiry and sarcasm.\n\nI agree, to some extent, that merchants using Bitpay does not really equate to increase in demand for BCH. But, I am also aware that it better than nothing. I chose not to use Bitpay though. I feel a bit hypocritical when I purchase giftcards with my various cryptocurrencies instead of being able to use my cryptocurrencies directly at merchants. Bitpay is effectively just a bank, converting one currency to another.",
