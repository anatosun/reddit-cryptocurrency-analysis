Honestly it is inevitable, and I guarantee I\u2019m right. The only aspect I have no authority or real debate for is how soon that comes. Whether that is 5 years or 30 years. It will come given the economic utility that Doge will service in the changing economics of credited trade. Doge will for sure reach $60 and even $100. Though I am more likely to see $21-$30 realistically at the pinnacle of my adult life.\n\nPeople that made your same argument in 2017 used the argument to state Doge couldn\u2019t reach $0.05 before 2050.\n\nI\u2019d be happy to give support cases to why my statement is inevitable in our lifetime, if you want.",

The more intelligent people said it couldn\u2019t reach .05 because of lack of interest in the coin not because it was physically impossible for it to reach a value of .05. It is literally impossible for doge to reach a value of 100$ per coin however. The market cap won\u2019t allow that. And if it even is possible it would most likely require more money to be dumped into doge then you could even imagine, and if you could imagine you\u2019d see it\u2019s not a plausible number. It could be worth 1,000,000$ in the future but it\u2019ll be a 1 doge = 1 doge situation. If it was like a dollar where we kinda set the value yeah it can be worth anything but till then 100$=  no can do\n\nAnd btw I love dogecoin \ud83d\udc99 I would love to see doge to the moon and all that good stuff, doge literally saved my life with a profit that allowed me to buy a house for my daughter and I in the middle of a terrible separation with 80,000 doge left over to hold for the future, and I have no plans on selling what I have left anytime soon, but I do stay realistic with its potential",

Being in the top 10 means nothing, I believe someone tracked the top ten coins over the years and found that around 80 percent of them either went to zero or lost over 90 percent of their value. And many others in the 20 percent split have lost over 40 or 50 percent of there value. Ethereum and bitcoin were exceptions to the rule, not the rule. Most coins will fail. Doge has lost a lot of hype and seems more like a fad that is fading away.",

Its also growing slightly as a payment method (tesla). Roumours that Elon would use it on a possible news feed platform, all suggest to me there is more hope now for Doge than before it peaked. I don't think it's going to be huge anytime soon but long term it should grow IMO.",
