            "selftext": "This post was censored at r/Bitcoin. I have heard r/btc is open to free speech/ideas. So please hear me out if you have 10 minutes to waste. \n\nEdit: Guys thank you for all the feedback. Most of it was constructive, and pretty much all of it was against proof of stake for various reasons. I wasn't trying to convince everybody, but I wanted to get everybody's thoughts. I think I have a pretty good sense of the community now. You couldn't have this over on r/Bitcoin which is probably why I didn't find any posts on it before I made this post. I just joined this sub today. In fact it has become apparent to me this is a bch sub but that being said the discussion is relevant and I appreciate the uncensored discussion. Thanks again.\n\nI'm pretty near a Bitcoin maxi. About 88% of my crypto is in Bitcoin atm, 11% in a high cap alt I believe in long term (not ETH), and 1% in a low cap alt (lottery ticket/hobby). The alts are both proof of stake (POS), and I have those coins staked on their native onchain platforms for residual income. I own the private keys, and trust only the smart contracts, no person or country/province can KYC my ass and seize my coins. OTOH, my Bitcoin (vast majority of my crypto) sits in cold storage earning nothing because there is no decentralized staking option. Yes I could lend the Bitcoin via Celsius or crypto.com or Nexo etc. which I see many here are doing. However, that is antithetical to the main idea of Bitcoin (unseizable, uncensorable, unprintable). You know those guys are running fractional reserves, and it takes just one bad bear market for a Ponzi to implode. Ask Bernie Madoff investors in 2008, or QuadrigaCX in 2018, or Bitconnect, etc. I will not risk my precious Bitcoin in the hands of some reckless CEO lending it on to day traders and hoping withdrawals don't exceed deposits, while paying themselves and investors unsustainable paper returns. Play stupid games long enough and it becomes statistically more certain you will win stupid prizes.\n\nWhat is the solution then to allow me to stake 88% of my crypto holdings (Bitcoin) for residual income while owning my private keys? Seems to me that POS is worth considering. For those about to say I am no Bitcoin maxi to even consider this, are you a Bitcoin maxi to lend your Bitcoin out to some Ponzi or CEX for a paper receipt? At least POS lets you own your private keys. Remember this line from Bitcoin rap battle in 2018: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to trust the people you just need to trust the code.\u201d Change can happen, and it is not always bad. Segwit was an improvement in block structure made in response to high fees / low throughput. It was great for Bitcoin. Today, plenty of Bitcoin \"hodlers\" are not actually hodling shit other than a Celsius network login/password. Not only does this risk their own Bitcoin, but it contributes to the devaluation of Bitcoin by helping create paper Bitcoin. POS can help solve both because your coins are locked in open source smart contracts, not in the SQL database of some CEX that might point to no real coins (ask QuadrigaCX bagholders), or be seized because KYC/AML or you might be a Russian (even if you live in Canada and do not support their war) or someone else the USA decides they dislike next week.\n\nCan POS be done with a fixed supply? YES. Both my alts are fixed-supply coins (unlike ETH). You stake for fees + remaining block rewards, same as Bitcoin miners get right now. I would NEVER advocate changing the 21m supply cap and nor would that be necessary, it is a red herring to suggest otherwise.\n\nCaveats? Sure. This is a huge programming task with the associated risks of bugs/exploits during the transition. Maybe even long term POS has some weakness that POW does not. Centralization might be one, though over time this would likely be less of an issue especially as people take their coins off exchanges to stake them onchain, and wider adoption continues.\n\nAnyway, maybe a BIPxxx one day will be put forth. I\u2019m an analyst and a coder of many years in myriad languages, but not a Bitcoin coder, so it would probably not be me, but just throwing this out there. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s been discussed and shot down many times, but I haven\u2019t seen any discussion of it lately other than how pissed people got when a speaker at the recent Bitcoin conference mentioned the idea. But with all the recent Bitcoin \u201chodlers\u201d here casually mentioning giving up their private keys for a little side income from Celsius or crypto.com, I thought this might be worth a fresh look.",

Proof of stake is very cheap for anybody to participate in it's just the fee to process a single smart contract call. This allows everybody who holds Bitcoin to participate in the consensus mechanism. On the other hand proof of work it's really only profitable for people in parts of the world with free electricity or who steal electricity from their landlords or who put together gigantic mining farms on enormous scales. On the other hand Joe Blow with $200 worth of bitcoin could participate in proof of stake quite easily. What I'm not sure about is the technical, are there technical weaknesses in proof of stake that are not present in proof of work. I'm no expert when it comes to that question. Also I do know I'm in the minority opinion but I appreciate everybody's feedback.",

Maybe I should dig up  a thread that summarizes the problems, and start linking it. \n\nThe quick tl/dr is:\n\n- PoW spreads coins, PoS hords them\n- You can't fork from an attack on PoS but you can with PoW\n- Everyone can join PoW. You just needs to buy hardware. To join PoS you need to buy the exact same thing you are joining and trying to stake.\n- Miners are much more invested in an algo and the coins that are mined with it. \n- There is some problem deciding which fork is valid when you come in later in PoS that doesn't exist in PoW\n\n\nThe problems of PoW: \n\n- Pool centralization and\n- Mining hardware supplier centralization \n\n\nThe energy usage of PoW is a necessity, like it is when you want to move from point A to point B. You can't do it without wasting energy. You can't get the features of PoW without the energy.\n\nEdit: Here is another thing to take into account. Our current system basically works like PoS. The ones that already have a ton of money also get the new money from the money printer. That is basically the PoS distribution without the decentralization.",

With p2p electronic cash, there is no built-in, ideological opposition to usage, and thus all of financialization opens up for the user, at which point they will be able to use the electronic cash in any number of ways without looking to the cash itself to make more cash for them.\n\nI don't want to sound like I'm harping on your idea, obviously a lot of projects are interested in POS.  It clearly has applications. \n\nDoes POS staking sound at all like a scheme to you?   Do you think bitcoin is an objective tool that puts the onus on users to take their own risks?",

You don't even need to purchase Bitcoin; you plug in your computer, and you immediately start functioning, so if the Bitcoin is banned in your country, it doesn't matter.\n\nI love Bitcoin's wasteful energy practices as well. It arbitrages electricity prices internationally and pushes innovation for hardware.\n\nHowever, considering upgrades for the PoW may be the better route. Keeping different types of consensus mechanisms in free markets for participants to decide their fate is a good intellectual and systematic communal diversification practice.",
