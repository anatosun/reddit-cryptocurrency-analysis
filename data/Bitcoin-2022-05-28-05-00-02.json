In Vietnam the average person just isn't very interested in bitcoin so the machines don't get used much. If I was a government person that had a viable currency I would likely be against bitcoin too. Until recently South Korea had a great economy yet a pretty weak currency. Why? The government wanted it that way. They can export and outcompete Japan and Taiwan because of this advantage. \n\nI currently own no bitcoin, I'm emotionally uninvolved. I'd love to see some major nations get behind it, but I don't see that happening. And I would bet money the US is bullying El Salvador over them getting into it. The US has the most to lose here as our currency is super vulnerable to a shock. I'm pretty sure the US is also scared of Gold, back in the day Bernake made a comment that people should consider bitcoin over gold. I doubt he was trying to make any peons some easy money, but trying to get the air out of the gold and silver market. At the time bitcoin was probably seen as the lesser of two evils, but once it reached a trillion market cap it becomes a threat.",
