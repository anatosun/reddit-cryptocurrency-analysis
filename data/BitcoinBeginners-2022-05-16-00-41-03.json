It's nice to have a full node to support the network, but it's not required to use a bitcoin wallet. \n\nYou can use a \"lightweight wallet\" to transact on the network, but utilize preexisting nodes to send the transaction through the network, without having to download the entire blockchain data on your machine. Personally I like [Electrum](https://electrum.org/) for this purpose.",

It's fascinating.\n\nThe .dat files contain the actual raw blockchain data. It's the BTC public ledger. Yeah, it's around 0.5 TB now. I run Core using an external SSD to store the blockchain.\n\nYou can run Core in \"prune\" mode. In this mode it only stores the most recent blocks (size configurable, I believe). You're looking at like maybe 5 GB in that case. You still have to download the entire blockchain to get synced up. This may burden your internet resource if you have a monthly cap. And it takes a long time (took me 3 days running mostly on off hours).  If you want to run Bitcoin Core you will have to devote *some* storage resource to .dat files.",
