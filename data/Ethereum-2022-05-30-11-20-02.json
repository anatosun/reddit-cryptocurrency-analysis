By having a fork of the decentralized manager with a copy pasta of the smart contract? Why not. \n\nIt would be great to be able to cover that case, I agree, as it would solve all issues about liquidity, as liquidity should never be owned by a decentralized manager (it provides misaligned incentives to steal this liquidity through a grab of consensus power: 51% of consensus power means grabbing 100% of liquidity).",
