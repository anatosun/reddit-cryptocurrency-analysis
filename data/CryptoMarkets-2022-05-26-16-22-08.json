I think this is finally some good news for all of us crypto enthusiasts, the last months were not good for crypto and I think this might be a breath of fresh air that we all needed ?  \n\n\nNow JP Morgan is JP Morgan they wouldn't be one of the biggest banks if they didn't know what they were doing and with their backing of crypto I think more people will be inclined to accept it and use it as a way to make income  for  themselves which will undoubtedly increase the value of crypto for all of us.   \n\n\nI have been seeing more and more projects that use blockchain and crypto as the basis for their business models that have amazed me and that aren't just focusing on currencies but rather things like sustainable energy (WePower, PowerLedger) or telecommunication (World Mobile Token, Telcoin) with all of this being further proof that we will be seeing crypto and blockchain utilization more and more in business and tech companies.   \n\n\nI believe with all of this, despite some hard times, crypto will only grow and that we only have to be patient and observe and make smart moves to remain in the game.",

Sadly I see some of those same people complaining Bitcoin has fallen. So you planned for multiple years to the next milestone but once we went from 2021 to 2022 you flip out Bitcoin hasn\u2019t gone up? WTF people. This is gambling at it\u2019s finest. Go with your gut instinct. It said longer than several months, clearly it\u2019s going to take that. Calm down and advance forward. I wish all of you a successful adventure from the bottom of my heart. I truly do. Peace.",
