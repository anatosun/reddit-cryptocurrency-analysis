                    "response": "Stablecoins are \"pegged\"  to some non-crypto asset, there's a number of approaches to this, but in general it means they aren't mined in the traditional sense.\n\nSome of the first \"stablecoins\" are pegged that way because some entity maintains a store of the non-crypto assets and mints/exchanges/burns in lock step with the coin.  If that entity stops doing that, the coin will stop being stable.\n\nLater stablecoins are \"algorithmic\" stablecoins that use a smart contract and on-chain reserve (in some other coin) plus an oracle to automatically mint/exchange/burn the stablecoin in order to maintain the exchange rate.  While these coins don't require as much trust in a particular entity, and have very large margins of error, they can still fail if the value reported by the oracle shifts faster than smart contract transactions can correct it, or if the reserve coin crashes beyond the margins of error.\n\nI don't know any idea what the impact will be.",
