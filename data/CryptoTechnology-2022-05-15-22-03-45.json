The two sides of the story**\n\n# Some miners are [reviving broken-down coal plants](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-miners-are-giving-new-life-to-old-fossil-fuel-power-plants-11621594803?mod=article_inline), or using low-cost natural gas to power their computers. \n\nThe cryptocurrency ban in China caused a mass exodus of \u201cminers\u201d to new locations around the world. A substantial number of miners migrated to nearby Kazakhstan (cheap coal), where they could , as well as to the United States (natural gas). Coal and natural gas are both drivers of climate change because burning fossil fuels pumps vast amounts of planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nA study in the journal [Joule](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/climate/bitcoin-china-energy-pollution.html) found that Bitcoin mining worldwide may be responsible for about 65 megatons of carbon dioxide a year, comparable to the emissions of Greece.\n\n# But on the other hand, the good news:\n\nMusk says Tesla will accept bitcoin again as crypto miners use more clean energy\n\nOn the other hand, [Argo Blockchain](https://argoblockchain.com/) is building a power plant for the internet age: a crypto \u201cmining\u201d site stocked with computers that generate new Bitcoins. But unlike other Bitcoin mining operations, which consume large quantities of fossil fuels and produce carbon emissions.\n\nFacing criticism from politicians and environmentalists, the cryptocurrency mining industry has embarked on a rebranding effort to challenge the prevailing view that its electricity-guzzling computers are harmful to the climate. \n\n**What do you think?**",

And you had to go through KYC, so whales and VC's can't buy everything from the community, which are really good points and got a lot of positive attention.",

So what is Kaddex its a DeX whose key value is zero gas fees and it's built on kadena. So basically they're solving for gas\n\nWhat problem is Bitcoin trying to solve, financial liberty through self sovereignty. How about Ethereum it's trying to be a global operating system used for programming money\n\nUsually when you ask the right questions it could inform you to build from scratch or to leverage an existing coin\n\nHaving said all this you could easily mint your token from Fuse they are an L2 for ETH and all you need is the idea. The coin would do what you program it to do\n\nHope this answers some of the questions",

With a hardware wallet, you can be reasonably sure that the generator was \"pure\", and you should never enter that seed anywhere other than your brain or physical medium, not near any cameras.\n\nBetween you typing your seed into your keyboard or clipboard and before it enters your \"secure\" software password manager, it has been through countless possibly compromised systems on your internet connected device. That fact alone should not allow you to get any sleep if you have significant capital tied to that key. There is no notification that will ever tell you someone tried to get access to your wallet - they may have access to it the moment you enter your key on your keyboard and wait potentially years or even decades before pulling your life savings. Using a software wallet with a compromised generator on a machine you agree to never take online again will also result in the same situation since that generator can be created to generate predictable and easily checkable keys by the creator.\n\nA trusted airgapped hardware generator and key manager, that ensures your key never touches the internet is the only way to sleep confidently, and that's called a hardware wallet. You get that confidence for $50 and a pen. If you're storing an immaterial amount of money then you can use any method you wish.\n\nGenerating multiple wallets can be seen as anti secure, as you increase the risk of them leaking or confusing yourself in the future. A well protected single key and hardware device is sufficient. You can use the device to manage multiple keys if you wish but it has its risks of incompetence, oversight or complacency (of which every individual is guilty on the timescale of a lifetime).\n\nIn summary, your original question about installing and uninstalling metamask does not afford you any additional security than any other means of managing your wallet solely on your internet-connected computer. It's better than storing your key in a txt file, but it's not even in the same universe as a hardware wallet.",

This fee is **burned** after transaction is made, resulting in Ether becoming **deflationary asset** \n2. **tip**:  sometimes called an optional tip, but in reality it's **not optional**, it will have to be paid. This tip go to the miners.\n\nSo by this, the Ethereum transaction fees are high because the majority of each fee is burned to **make** **Ether deflationary asset**, because **Ether doesn't have a capped supply** \\- meaning unlike Bitcoin, which is capped at 21 million coins, Ether has no such limit. \n\nThis is probably good for Ether holders but I cant understand why is this solution good for ordinary user or the projects running on Ethereum as everybody is just crying for lower fees. \n\nNext planned solution for smaller fees in Ethereum network is to move majority of transaction off the main chain into Layer2 is also quite controversial ....\n\nWhat is your though about that?",

And it also keeps the overall monetary inflation almost negligible. (Despite most people misunderstanding, its current circulating supply is less inflationary than Bitcoin's, but monetary inflation isn't necessarily bad in the first place.)\n\nWithout high fees, the network security degrades, and you can't expect it to hold on altruism alone.\n\nEthereum's ecosystem is sustainable indefinitely even with its proof of work consensus. Bitcoin and most blockchains are unsustainable with current transaction fees. When Bitcoin's block subsidy declines by 99% in 30 years, its transaction fees are probably going to go up 5-50x. Similarly, many blockchains subsidize their block rewards and staking for 5-10 years. Those blockchains will also need to transition to a different economic model once they approach their time bomb.\n\nEthereum is different in that it's already economically-sustainable and will get cheaper with rollups and data sharding.",

But the fact is that at the time EIP-1559 was introduced, the Ethereum network was ON FIRE about transaction costs and was so unreliable for regular users that it was a problem that needed to be fixed. Yes it's still expensive but at the time it was expensive AND unpredictable meaning you could pay $250 for a transaction and still have it not go through and lose the fee anyway because you didn't accurately predict the cost. I think they acted out of pressure and really pushed this protocol through out of needing to act. \n\nPrioritizing deflation through burning also gives a little head start to the idea of rewarding those with a bigger hold of ETH which was never really a thing before. The idea is that over a long enough time, the more ETH you hold the better off you'll be if it's deflationary and it's meant to reward those people, not average joe users. Again I'm not sure exactly why this was prioritized over sidechain development but here we are, it's just how the devs decided to go about it. I'm speculating but maybe they saw the rise of other L2s and sidechains and see that as a bandaid for the time being, allowing them to focus their energy on the PoS merge/difficulty bomb which seems to be their #1 priority at this point, and putting sharding on the backburner for now",

The fact that ~90% gets burned doesn't mean that the fair market value is actually 10 gwei and everyone else is overpaying by 90 gwei. If you artificially reduce the basefee so that the cost is 10 gwei, then you'll just suffer the known consequences of price fixing. If anything the priority fee would then jump to 90 gwei and the miner would get it.\n\nEIP1559 didn't change the market value of gas, it just overhauled the dynamic. Instead of miners getting that 100 gwei, the network gets it. It makes more sense this way, the network is offering blockspace, not the miners. The miners are basically \"employees\" providing security to the network and getting compensated for it with the reward of 2 ETH every block they mine. Same deal with validators later on, they get paid with issuance.",

            "selftext": "**MEV strategies**\n\nOne of the more interesting topics I come across regularly is MEV, Maximal Extractable Value (formerly \"Mining Extractable Value\"). It refers to the maximum value that can be extracted by predator miners and bots in excess of the standard block reward by manipulating transactions or the order of transactions in a block proposal. This includes arbitrage strategies such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, repeating transactions, and other pure-profit plays. It can also refer to other bot attacks on transactions submitted to the mempool. As such, this affects many crypto networks, most noticeably Ethereum due to its large mempool and gas arbitrage.\n\nNot only do bots attack transactions, but they sometimes even compete against other bots for it. Unlike in traditional finance, bots can multiple submit multiple competing transactions with the same origin nonce without worrying about accidental conflicts and duplicates. It's not uncommon to see multiple bots attempt to arbitrage single large transaction within a couple of seconds of each other, each trying to beat the previous submission with higher transaction fees. In this type of bidding war, also known as a \"Priority Gas Auction\" (PGA), the bot with the lowest network latency to the winning miner is often the winner.\n\nI'm not going to cover common MEV strategies because it gets quite detailed. But if you're interested, you can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR1v7AQ8i3k) or read the [Flash Boys research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf) by Cornell U. In addition, miners can also employ their own MEV strategies such including censorship/withholding attacks and time-bandit attacks.\n\n-------------\n\n**The Dark Forest**\n\nMEV leads into \"The Dark Forest\" of the blockchain network. This term is named after what's arguably the most-significant hard sci-fi series of the past decade. (If you haven't read the \"Three Body Problem\" series and don't plan to, I recommend watching a YouTube summary.)\n\nSimilar to Liu Cixin's novel of the same title, the blockchain network is a Dark Forest filled with advanced predators, but in the form of automated miners and bots. The moment your transaction is submitted to the mempool via gossip protocol, it is immediately scanned by armies of bots that test if your transaction can be exploited for MEV strategies and other attacks. This happens all the time and by design. Even test networks have bots scanning constantly for vulnerabilities. [Researchers have confirmed](https://www.ise.io/casestudies/ethercombing/) that if you submit a transaction from a wallet with a manually-set weak password, the wallet will be compromised in seconds. Some bot will immediately submit another transaction to empty it and beat you to the next block. This is known as Ethercombing.\n\n**Dark Forest Case 1**\n\nWith Smart Contracts, Dark Forest attacks become even more complex. \"[Ethereum is a Dark Forest](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest/)\" describes a situation where a group of researchers attempted to rescue tokens sent to the wrong contract. They knew they had to obfuscate their transaction so that predator bots would not figure out their transaction, reproduce it, and beat them due to direct mining and network advantage. Unfortunately, the researchers still lost because the node they were submitting to kept rejecting their custom smart contract, and some bot front-ran them the moment they submitted the main transaction. It was gone in an instant.\n\n**Dark Forest Case 2**\n\nIn a later smart contract story, \"[Escaping the Dark Forest](https://samczsun.com/escaping-the-dark-forest/)\", rescuers succeeded in recovering nearly 10M USD of tokens from a buggy smart. Despite that the smart contract was audited by ConsenSys and CertiK, a researcher privately discovered another bug in it. (There's a good reason smart contract hacks are jokingly considered multi-million-dollar bug bounties.) He then contacted multiple parties to form a team to rescue the funds while avoiding Dark Forest attacks. The team determined that even with their best strategies, MEV front-running was way too big of a risk. Instead, they direct-hired a mining pool so that they could skip the mempool. This strategy is sometimes employed by whales to keep their transactions secret from other miners. Even so, it wasn't guaranteed that other miners wouldn't notice and beat them to it. They waited 15 nerve-racking blocks before their transaction was included, successfully rescuing the funds.\n\n-------------\n\nI hope you've enjoyed this post. This was written is to the best of my limited knowledge. Please let me know if you spot any errors or additional insight to MEV strategies and the Dark Forest.",

            "selftext": "So I have two problems. Very big problems. I bought two coins on PancakeSwap and one shows only the balance of the second buy (for like 5\u20ac) cause I thought my tokens are getting redirected after swapping cause they weren't showing\n\nhttps://bscscan.com/token/0x8a1876c8f82cf4c23a13b33930973a9a9530676d?a=0x3c32d0bb7a79ae33153e49919dfde6f2547ccaa4\n\nAs you can see, the balance is only 1.5k although I bought 115k an hour ago. The 115k aren't showing..\n\nSecond Problem is that this second coin is even showing up when adding a custom token on trust wallet and yes it's smart chain.\n\nhttps://bscscan.com/tx/0xf6378780b07db14e1e4e8bf0cd5cafc854cd82808cadc77a268e792080c14b1c\n\nPlease help, did my coins get redirected? Did I get scammed ? Please help someone explain please.",

            "selftext": "So we all know there is a hard push for voting for political people to be on blockchain. But many are pushing as it is a cure all, when it isn't. And the other side is pushing as it's pointless when it's very much needed.\n\n# How would it work?\n\nThere would have to be a way the person votes. This can include current or future methods. This could include everyone having a hardware wallet and voting the same way in crypto we vote.\n\nFrom there the votes would have to be place on the blockchain.\n\n# The good\n\nOnce it hits the blockchain everything can be verified giving the blockchain is secure. Meaning like we seen in this past president election where we had groups putting the same ballot into a machine many times to pump the votes. Depending on where the vote goes onto the blockchain this won't be possible.\n\n# The problem\n\n1. If the thing that is taking the vote is messed up, then this is a problem. So for example, if we do more mail in ballots, the thing goes to a single place to be put in, and then we can have people scanning ballots over and over. As you can see blockchain can't solve anything in that system. But if the person hits a button or some scanner at a polling location connects directly to the blockchain. Then that won't be a problem, but the device that scans or the thing you pressed the button on if it is messed up then it can be a problem.\n2. Another problem is if the gov owns the blockchain or a small blockchain is used. If the gov owns the blockchain the gov can literally flip votes without anyone knowing. If it's a small blockchain then it can easily get attacked.\n\n# The solution\n\nFor mail in ballots, hardware wallets could be used. I honestly think your citizen identification card will be a hardware wallet in the future. Note this doesn't completely solve the problem because what if the hardware wallet is compromised before you get it. But for the here and now, what could happen is instead of mailing in the ballot. Much of it will require the person to physically go to a DMV, post office, library, or some other secure building to pick up their hardware wallet. From here the person can use it at their house, and they can return it. Or if it's a really remote place without internet then there could a be a secure device the person can pick up that can't be edited once scanned. The person would just need to send back the device for their vote to be counted.",

A way I could see blockchain voting:\n\n* Credibly neutral decentralized base layer is a given. No entity or government can secretly alter things settled on the layer, no matter how much resources they got. \n\n* Every citizen is issued a \"citizenship NFT\" either at birth or when they acquire citizenship through immigration.\n\n  * The reason for the citizenship NFT is to prevent sybil attacks where you can generate arbitrarily many keys and pretend to be a unique person. There has to be *some* \"proof of humanity\" aspect, and even if you use a more socially decentralized protocol like [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/), you're still gonna need some recognition of who is an elligble voter from the government you're voting for anyway.\n\n* The citizen NFT is non-transferrable, and managed through a smart wallet that abstracts away the private/public key hassle for the average people, has social recovery features, etc. Essentially the wallet that owns the NFT would be for all and purposes the identifier for any and all things public. Taxes, voting, registration, etc. \n\n* Voting happens with zero-knowledge cryptography. Without leaking any information about who you are or who you're voting for, you interact with the Voting smart contract to prove that you own your NFT citizenship and:\n\n  * you haven't previously voted, and want to increase a specific party's total vote count by 1\n\n  * you have previously voted for a specific party and now want to cancel your vote and decrease their total vote count\n\n* When the voting period is over, no one can send in proofs of vote anymore and every party's total vote count is final. (The reason for letting people cancel their vote and vote for someone else whenever they want is to prevent vote-buying)\n\nThat way votes happen in secret, no one can vote more than once, the results are secure, no one has undue influence. \n\nOf course the zeroknowledge tech and smart wallets are a long way off, and having government adapt with \"citizenship NFT\" is an even longer way off but like I said it's all speculative for fun anyway.\n\nThe voting smart contract would work kinda like Tornado.cash, fully auditable and all. You interact with it from any wallet not tied to your identity to zero-knowledge prove you own a citizenship NFT so any information about who did or didn't vote and who they voted for isn't leaked. All that matters are the final results",

All it needed was the seed phrase to give me access. \n\nSo I was thinking about whether or not someone could guess my seed phrase and found this comment. \n\n>Brute forcing a 12 word secret phrase from a 2048 word list: each guess has a 1 in 2048\u00b9\u00b2, or 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000184% chance of being correct. If you could make a trillion guesses per second on each of a trillion computers, it would take the lifetime of the universe so far to have a decent shot at it.    \n>  \n>Brute forcing a 24 word secret phrase from a 2048 word list: each guess has a 1 in 2048\u00b2\u2074 chance of being correct. It would take 2048\u00b9\u00b2 as many computers, or 2048\u00b9\u00b2 universes, as the 12 word secret, to brute force it.\n\n I understand that it would be incredibly hard to brute force a specific seed phrase. However, this math is assuming the chances of you guessing a single seed phrase, not ANY seed phrase. \n\nAssuming that: \n\n* Google says current estimates are somewhere around 70 million wallets. Assuming everyone in the world has at least one and the population grows, that could be 10B+\n* New technologies like quantum computing come through and can do ungodly amounts of guesses per second\n* There are many malicious people/computers out there trying to guess seed phrases all at once\n\nDoesn't this mean the chance of someone guessing \\*any\\* seed phrase will rise quite a bit? Why wasn't the technology designed so that you had to have the public address AND the seed phrase?",

The odd of one randomly pick phrase not being a specific wallet is (1 - 1 / 2^128) which is very very very close to 100%, so the odds of not being *any* of 1 billion wallets is like repeating that \"event\" 1 billion times in a row, so `(1 - 1 / 2^128)^1,000,000,000 = 99.9999999999999999999999999997061%` according to wolfram alpha. The odds of picking a valid wallet is `1 minus all that` so `0.000000000000000000000000000294%` or roughly 1 chance in 3,402,823,669,209,384,634,633,746,074\n\nAgain, that's the odds if there were 1 billion wallets with fund, which there aren't, a lot of them are secured by 24 words instead of just 12.\n\nThe wallets are safe lol",

Other miners just take the block proposed by the winner of proof-of work race and\nonly runs VM on proposed transactions to verify it. This way miners run consensus on\nthe next (future) state of the chain.\nISC, in contrast, runs among validators consensus on the inputs to the VM, the batch\nof requests, i.e. consensus on the present state. After consensus on inputs is reached,\neach validator node runs VM to calculate te block for itself (it is always valid due to the\ndeterminism of VM).\nThe ISC consensus randomizes the order of inputs to VM with a unpredictable randomess\ngenerated by the consensus round itself. This makes content of the batch (including order)\nunpredictable for validators unless \u230a2N/3\u230b + 1 collude.\nSo, ISC consensus prevents MEV by making validators unable to determine\ncontent of the block",

            "selftext": "Suppose for the context some blockchain or something in many ways like a blockchain which has a smart contract instruction set (at least analogous to EVM instruction set, or Bitcoin opcodes I suppose).  \n\nNow, aiui, there are already things even in Bitcoin such that what exactly a transaction does depends on the settings of the miner who mines the block. (I haven't checked whether on Bitcoin one can use this to do things other than just \"send some amount of coins to whatever address the block producer lists as their address\" but, this does at least have some dependency on what the block producer chose.).  \n\nBut, my question is whether it could potentially be useful to have instructions which expand this influence substantially (when requested by the code being executed as part of the transaction).  \n\nThat is, (now, again thinking more on the \"EVM instructions used in a smart contract\" side of the scale than the \"Bitcoin opcodes\" side of the scale), suppose there was an instruction which would request some number of bytes from the mining software, perhaps with a hint for what kind of source these bytes should be from, which the mining software would insert. These bytes provided by the miner would be included in the block so that others validating the blocks could check that the transaction was executed in a valid way, but there would be no technical restriction on what bytes the miner can provide.  \n\nFor example, the smart contract could request untrusted-random bytes from the miner. These would not be trustworthy, because if the miner benefited from manipulating them, well, they can choose them to be whatever they want. But, if the benefit of the randomness is just for efficiency of execution, and having no bearing as to the part of the result which is the point of the smart contract, then if the smart contract+transaction was set up such that the miner was no worse off by providing random bytes than if they manipulated the bytes provided to make the contract run inefficiently, then perhaps miners could be expected to set their mining software to provide random bytes in these cases?\n\nOr, instead, suppose the miner is likely to have access to some information which the smart contract can cheaply verify, but which cannot be cheaply computed by the smart contract, and which requires information that the person sending the transaction does not have at the time that they send the transaction (but which the miner of a block including the transaction would be likely to know. Or, alternatively, which their mining software would be likely to know.)  \nThen, the smart contract could request the bytes, check if the bytes provided satisfy the condition, and if so, reward the miner, and if not, abort and quit early (to avoid additional gas fees).\n\n(which type of request is being made could be determined by an additional hint parameter, even though from the perspective of validating a block these two things would be equivalent)\n\n\n(I was originally thinking of such an operation in the context of many interlinked permission-ed chains, each with a single block producer, but where there are links between the different chains where each chain has associated with it a smart contract on a number of the other chains which holds some collateral which, if presented with proof that the one chain has acted invalidly, gives a payout to make whole the person presenting the proof, but, I thought the concept might also be applicable more broadly, and actually, probably more applicable more generally than in the case I was originally thinking of.  \nNote that I'm not claiming that the security of the original thing I was thinking of works out. I'm quite unsure of that. This post isn't meant to advocate for that idea.)\n\n**So, my question:** Do you have any arguments for why this would \"(almost) never be a good instruction to support\" ? Do you see any good use-cases that stand out to you?    \n\nI suppose that if one wants some random bytes and is not concerned whether they can be manipulated by an adversary, then just using the hash of the previous block could suffice for that.  \nBut, also, if a smart contract set things up such that choosing the \"random\" bytes maliciously was never beneficial to the miner, then perhaps the first case could be used in situations where \"random\" bytes would suffice, but where a benevolent choice of bytes would be even better for both the author of the contract and the miner, and so, miner software could use random values for it (or just previous block hash), but such that if the miner software could easily enough analyze which values would be even better than random, use that?  \n\nIn that case, the hint for which type of non-determinism is requested, could serve as a hint to mining software of either \"just giving me a random value is sufficient here (though I'd appreciate a carefully chosen value~)\" or \"unless you give me a carefully chosen value that actually works for me, including this transaction won't give you nearly as much miner reward, so unless you are going to do that, it is in your best interest to not include this transaction\".\n\n____________________\n\n\n**An almost entirely separate thought:**\n\nHm, so, I know there are instructions for \"actually, revert all the changes that this transaction made (including any calls to other contracts it may have made), except for gas fees\".  \n\nBut, if there was an instruction that meant \"if this instruction is executed as part of a transaction, then that transaction cannot be included in a valid block\", well... I suppose that miners likely would choose not to even *consider* including transactions which involve a contract that have such a instruction.  \nBut if there were such an instruction, and some mining software could easily check whether certain transactions would with high confidence not hit that instruction, perhaps it could still be worth checking in those cases? But perhaps it could allow an attack where miners are spammed with potential transactions that they would have to take the time to check if the transactions involve a contract with such an instruction anywhere in it in order to reject it, and this would be too costly even to do that extra check, even without trying to check if the transaction would actually hit the instruction.  \n\nOh, another issue is if like, one contract does a computation to determine what other contract to call, and the other contract potentially calls a contract which includes this instruction. That would be rather exploitable. That's no good. I suppose this could be handled by saying that if a contract calls another contract which includes this instruction, then the transaction immediately ends but with all the gas costs so far still being paid. (or, alternatively, the miner can choose whether to do that, or to continue. But I'd imagine most would do that and not continue, unless there was a big reward.) That way, miners would only have to check if the first contract to be called contains the instruction in order to decide whether they want to consider attempting the transaction.\n\nThe small connection between these two ideas is that like, if you had both, then in the second type of non-determinism, that way you could have a contract that basically says \"query an oracle(the miner) for bytes that satisfy these criteria. If the results do not match the criteria, then they never happened, and not even gas fees are paid.\" . And, that seems like it could be useful.  \n\nOf course, one could always set things up so that in one transaction, you set the criteria and provide payment for a reward, and then another transaction (likely by someone else) can provide the required information, and then receives the provided reward, and the computation continues. But this way of doing it would span multiple blocks, so, e.g. this couldn't be done inside a flash loan, or other things that need to be done within a single transaction.\n\n...\n\nSorry this was kind of stream of consciousness and disjointed.",

Also, exchanges like Coinbase is made more for the retail /smaller investors while an exchange like Kraken focuses on institutional investors and high net-worth investors. In my experience, Kraken has the lowest fees which is why Elon Musk, Mark Cuban, Kevin O\u2019Leary, Kathy Woods, Jim Cramer, Kanye and more use them. At the end of the day an exchange like Kraken would rather have high net-worth and institutional investors rather than the retail investor, it\u2019s less customer service, less overhead and more time to focus on security. Again, this is just my opinion based on my research and personal experience. I hope this helps!",

            "selftext": "Here is some napkin math on how long it would take a $1000 desktop computer to validate a 1GB block  once the known bottlenecks are resolved. (4000 tx a second)\n\n**First, block propagation.** With graphene, a typical 1 GB block can be encoded in about 20 kB, most of which is order information. With a canonical ordering, that number should drop to about 5 kB. Sending 20 kB or 5 kB over the internet is pretty trivial, and should add about **1 second** total.\n\n**Second, IBLT decoding.** I haven't seen any benchmarks for decoding the IBLTs in Graphene for 1 GB blocks, but in 2014 I saw some benchmarks for 1 MB blocks that showed decoding time to be around 10 ms. If it scales linearly, that would be **around 10 seconds** for decoding.\n\n**Third, block sorting.** A 1 GB block would have about 2.5 million transactions. Assuming that we're using a canonical lexical ordering, we will need to sort the txids for those transactions. Single-threaded sorting is typically between 1 million keys per second and (for uint64_t keys) 10 million keys per second, so sorting should take around **1 second**.\n\n**Fourth, computing and verifying the merkle root hash.** The amount of hashing needed to do this is equal to 1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 + ... = 2 times the summed length of the txids, multiplied by two because we do two rounds of SHA256. With 2.5 million transactions, that's 320 MB of hashing. SHA256 can do around 300 MB/s on a single core, so this will take about **1 second**.\n\n**Fifth, block validation**. This step is hard to estimate, because we don't have any good benchmarks for how an ideal implementation would perform, nor do we even have a good idea of what the ideal implementation would look like. Does the node have the full UTXO set in RAM, or does it need to do SSD reads? Are we going to shard the UTXO set by txid across multiple nodes? Are we using flash or Optane for the SSD reads and writes? But this napkin math, so here's a shot. A 1 GB block is likely to have around 5 million inputs and 5 million outputs. Database reads can be done as a single disk IO op pretty easily, but writes generally have to be done more carefully, with separate writes to the journal, and then to multiple levels of the database tree structure. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that each database write consists of four disk writes plus one disk read, or 5 ops total. This means that a 1 GB block will require around 10 million reads and 20 million writes. Current-gen m.2 PCIE NVMe top-of-the-line SSDs can get up to 500k IOPS. In two years, a good (but not top-end) SSD will probably be getting around 1 million random IOPS in both reads and writes. This would put the disk accesses at around **30 seconds** of delay. Sharding the database onto multiple SSDs or multiple nodes can reduce that, but I presume desktop computers won't have access to that. If we have Optane, the UTXO stuff should get way faster (10x? 50x?), as Optane has byte-level addressability for both reads and writes, so we will no longer need to read and write 4 kB blocks for each 30 byte UTXO. Optane also has much better latency, so a good database will be able to get lower write amplification without needing to worry about corruption.\n\n**Zeroth, script verification**. This is generally done when a transaction hits mempool, and those validation results are cached for later use, so no substantial extra script verification should need to be done during block validation. All we need is to make sure AcceptToMemoryPool doesn't get bogged down in the 10 minutes before the block. A single CPU core can verify about 5000 p2pkh scripts (i.e. single ECDSA sigop) per second, so an 8-core desktop should be able to handle 40,000 p2pkh inputs per second. Verifying the 5 million inputs in advance should take 125 seconds out of our 600 second window. That's cutting our safety margins a bit close, but it's tolerable for a non-mission-critical min-spec machine. Because this is done in advance, that 125/600 seconds turns into **0 seconds** for the sake of this calculation.\n\n**All told**, we have about (1 + 10 + 1 + 0.5 + 30) = **42.5 seconds** for a decent desktop to receive and verify a 1 GB block, assuming that all the code bottlenecks get fixed. There are probably a few other steps that I didn't think of, so maybe 60 seconds is a more fair estimate. Still, it's reasonable.\n\nMiners will, of course, need to be able to receive and process blocks much faster than this, but they will have the funding to buy computers with much greater parallelization, so their safety margin versus what they can afford should be about the same as for a casual desktop user.\n\n\n\nupstream bandwidth  largely depends on how many peers that our user has. Let's assume that our desktop user is a middle-class hobbyist, and is only sacrificing peer count a little bit in favor of reduced hardware requirements. Our user has 8 peers.\n\nTransaction propagation comes from 3 different p2p messages. \n\n**The first message is the INV message**, which is used to announce that a node knows one or more transactions with a specified TXID or TXIDs. These INV messages are usually batched into groups of 3 or so right now, but in a higher-throughput context, would likely be batched in groups of 20. The TCP/IP and other overhead is significant, so an INV for a single TXID is around 120 bytes, and each additional TXID adds around 40 bytes (not the 32 byte theoretical minimum). With 20 tx per inv, that's 880 bytes. For each peer connection, half of the transactions will be part of a received INV, and half will be part of a sent INV. This means that per 2.5 million transactions (i.e. one block) per peer, our node would send and receive 55 MB. For all 8 peers, that would be **440 MB** in each direction for INVs.\n\n**The second and third messages are the tx request and the tx response.** With overhead, these two messages should take around 600 bytes for a 400 byte transaction. If our node downloads each transaction once and uploads once, that turns into **1.5 GB** of traffic in each direction per block.\n\nLastly, we need to propagate the blocks themselves. With Graphene, the traffic needed for this step is trivial, so we can ignore it.\n\nIn total, we have **about 1.94 GB bidirectional** of traffic during each (average) 600 second block interval. That translates to average bandwidth of 3.23 MB/s or **25.9 Mbps**. This is, again, reasonable to expect for a motivated middle-class hobbyist around 2020, though not trivial.",

Well, miners of course or they cant receive the tx that go in the blocks. So when a new block is found, every miner already knows 99,99% of what is in the block from their own mempool. Graphene is therefore a scheme to just exchange enough information till the miner sending the block and the mempool receiving the block know what information is missing. Then only the difference is exchanged using inverted bloom filters, the mempool on the receiving side uses this information to build the exact same block as the miner has. So its not really compression, its an info exchange scheme taking advantage of the fact that 99% of the time, 99% of the miners know 99% of the tx.\n\nGavin Andresen invented it, he was the dev that Satoshi gave the keys but was later politically excecuted by state actors. with his influence Bitcoin would now be doing 20 mil tx a day and most other chains would not exist.

ISPs will definitely not be happy with 1 node that takes up 26 Mbps constantly, when they could just block that node's connection & free it up for the hundreds of other connections that can be more easily cached on their end (media from CDNs), or that are bursty & don't need a lot of bandwidth when processing their immediate requests (most of the web, gaming).\n\n**and (c)** Assumes that a hobbyist can afford the storage required to keep that full node running. Even if your calculations are correct, they'll still have to store that block as a 1GB block. \n\n1GB x 6/hour x 24hours/day = **144GB/day**. \n\n144GB/day x 365.25 days/year = **52.596TB/year.** \n\nEven using [$15 per TB](https://diskprices.com/) as the cheap end for disk space, maintaining the storage expansion for that alone would easily exceed 750USD per year, just to maintain full node sync capabilities.

Your seedbox upload is a recorded anomaly on their servers, and they're likely keeping tabs on your internet usage to just cut you off when you go way above what a regular person uses. \n\nEven if your ISP is fine with all of that, other ISPs don't necessarily share the same sentiment that your ISP does.

I understand once a transaction has been mined and is included in a block on the blockchain, it cannot be canceled or replaced. This is absurdly inconvenient for a regular user. Over the years, I read dozens of posts in which users sent the asset to the wrong addresses and those tokens are unrecoverable.  \n\n\nBack to my question, is there any blockchain out there that offers cancellation or reversal options?\n\nOne of the solutions I can think of is for each transaction there should be a seed phrase or password generated by the sender. The recipient received the fund, and that fund will be in a lock, and in order to get full access to it, the recipient needs a seed phrase from the sender. If the recipient didn't unlock the fund within 24hr (or XYZ time frame) the fund send back to the sender.  \n\n\nI am open to criticism and will like to hear what you guys things.",

Even making it in a contract isn\u2019t a silver bullet solution because at some point you want all the money to be spendable, and not indefinitely in this reversible state. You need to have some way to commit and make those transactions irreversible at some point, either through time locks or a contract function that lets you commit. If you don\u2019t have that, it can\u2019t work because you can never do rollbacks on already spent money. Best you can do is make all payments in wrapped/reversible ETH, which say automatically commits in 1 hour, during which time you can cancel the transactions but after that it\u2019s fully sent/non reversible.\n\nThe closest thing there is that is not worked on but even Buterin admitted should be considered high priority, is making wallets that support losing parts of the password.

Look at the wrose case scenario where someone manages to game the system and reverse a transaction when they shouldnt have. Things like payment for a service that was done, and cant be reversed while the transaction can?",

Our company is very focused on vertical integration and 'owning' as much of our revenue stream as we possibly can due to the nature of our biz model this often means getting crafty with our technology use. Additionally we as owners are all into crypto overall and constantly looking for excuses to integrate and get our industry involved in crypto.\n\nOne big project we are starting to tackle is payment processing and \"fee capture\" (for things like tickets and concessions). We are looking at a number of solutions including whit labeling other tech and developing our own solutions, part of this conversation brought up a solution for accepting USD (or other Fiat currencies) from major CC providers that pays out the merchant in crypto with the elegance of a top tier pos / ccp provider (stripe, pay pal, cash drop, cash app / square etc). Im aware that the inverse of this exists and that crypto > crypto payment processing exists, but not Fiat > crypto? Seems like an obvious tech service and maybe ive failed to google this correctly :-/\n\nAny guidance, thoughts, or opinions on services that accomplishes this would be helpful. Thanks in advance.",

If the product is in extremely high demand, the buyer could choose to make their email or phone number available in the ledger and agree not to open the item for a specified time in hopes of reselling at a higher price. It could even be a common ledger used by all retailers so consumers simply input the item and an indexer returns all database results.\n\nThis type of public online ledger system could work for events as well. Everyone involved in the event, from the band, group, comedian, speaker, site owners and operators, parking coordinators, and attendees have access to the immutable blockchain ledger which shows how many tickets/seats and parking spaces have been sold and how many remain, eliminating any central authority who may or may not be keeping accurate and up to date information and can easily manipulate prices, possibly knowingly overbooking or misleading ticket buyers about overcrowding. Truly decentralized and transparent data for all involved, and lowered costs and prices because less coordinators and data keepers (and data falsifiers) are necessary.\n\nTo avoid false data entry (the only real obstacle to this system), token transfers must occur at every step before the ledger is updated. These token transfers are recorded in the ledger also, and the vendors use these tokens as payment. If any discrepancies arise, the ledger can be examined by anyone to determine who attempted to falsify and the malicious party can be held accountable. Alternatively, a smart contract can be written beforehand which stipulates exactly who should be paid tokens by whom and by how much, and any other attempted transactions or ledger updates are disallowed.",

Eventually the networks will be interoperable and invisible, but for now, yes, you have to know these things.\n\nApps don't require you to change networks to use them.  They can be found on the Internet, as mobile apps, and so on.  The blockchain is a sort of database behind the scenes.\n\nWhere you really want to pay attention is when you want to move money, and connect your wallet.  Wallets don't work across all networks. Most of us have one wallet for one specific kind of network or currency.  A popular cross-network wallet is Metamask, where you can enter the details of the network you want to use.

            "selftext": "Start with the core of something like bitcoin or ethereum, but make it so that every wallet address is only able to send some percent of it's coin holdings in some timeframe.\n\nEach send transaction checks the highest coin balance held by the sender's address and the previous total sent amounts in the current block-interval timeframe, if sender attempts to send amount + fee + previous total sent > 10% of highest balance for the block-interval timeframe then the transaction is invalidated.\n\nYou could make a few different coins with different tiers of send-limiting satisfying different investment goals and desired uses:\n\n0.9\\^x\\[days\\]=0.05, x=1 month to sell to 5% of initial investment.\n\n0.9\\^x\\[weeks\\]=0.05, x=6.7 months to sell to 5% of initial investment.\n\n0.99\\^x\\[weeks\\]=0.05, x=5.7 years to sell to 5% of initial investment.\n\n0.99\\^x\\[months\\]=0.05, x=24.8 years to sell to 5% of initial investment.\n\nEx. You buy 1 coin and with that you are only able to sell 10% of it every week. This will mean that no matter how much any person buys it will almost never suddenly dump from a whale pulling out or a sudden crypto-news crashing the market or whatever. At most only 10% of all the capital invested will be able to be sold in 1 week. The selling pressure will be limited towards 10% of what it would've been if it were a regular cryptocurrency because no one can sell more than 10% of what they have each week.\n\nThis artificially reduces the volume of sellers which enforces an upward trend in the price movement thus enticing more buyers and almost guaranteeing it's own success as a store-of-value. And because people are severely limited in their ability to send the coin, you have effectively solved the Prisoner's Dilemma of as many investor's having to trust that each other will hold onto their investment rather than dump and crash the price simply by hard coding a limit to everyone's ability to sell.\n\nOf course it would be in some cases difficult to perform transactions in a currency that you can only sell a portion of in some timeframe, but in theory due to the inherent reduction of selling pressure relative to buying pressure, the price should keep going up forever due to the asymmetry of more people trying to buy than will be able to sell.\n\nI suppose PoS or PoW would be an interesting question though I expect it would work fine under any of those variants.\n\nThe issue of additional cryptocurrencies copying this design would present some challenge, exactly the same as it has for regular crypto now, but due to the limitations of only being able to leave the first established one in some cases very slowly it would be much less of an issue for the first, and might disincentivize risking jumping into lesser copycats due to the lock-up of capital in a potentially poor investment, there would probably be plenty of slowly dying copycats which slowly collapse long after most everyone already started selling. Though these should be less likely to die than regular cryptos.\n\nThere is also the question of which proportion and which timeframe would see the greatest success. Naturally whichever one limits the selling pressure the most would have the smallest selling pressure, but it would also be a very hyperopic design, and people are far more prone to myopic interests so unreasonably stricter selling limitations would also reduce buying pressure, though in the most long-term of investments reasonable across the scale of entire generations such a store-of-value could very well compete in it's own league of self enforced long-term investments to become one of the top investments of all time. So it wouldn't surprise me if a few tiers of different selling limitations each had successful sale-limited cryptocurrencies of their own depending on the timeframes of investments an investor is looking to lock their money into. Much like a government CD.\n\nIf anyone finds this idea interesting it would be great to discuss about it, I haven't encountered any cryptocurrencies that use this model, but I'd definitely be interested to see people using it. Personally I'd be interested to be involved in any currency that tries to implement it.",

Crypto currency is a way to store value without human compromise, a way to transfer those value without people's  unfairness. Nevertheless part of transferring value is transferring value between generations known as inheritance (Next of kin), as broken as the current financial system is, they do offer this very part of finance.\nThis might not be a huge problem now, but with time this will become an unavoidable huge problem.\n\nAs speculation have it, Satoshi might be dead, never can tell, but if he is, then his value stored on crypto is lost forever which in a short time means good for crypto value, but how long before everyone holding crypto losses those value due to dead and lost of wallet seed?.\nSharing your wallet seed doesn't cut it, as it will grant your Next of Kin access directly to those value while you are still alive, giving a lawyer compromise the security of those value as it only require your lawyer for those value to be compromised.\n\nTHE SOLUTION\na well secure decentralised finance that doesn't have access to your value, cannot give your Next of Kin access to your value while you are still alive but can securely verify your Next of Kin and help them securely gain access when you are gone. \n\nMore details to be disclosed to programmers and investors who are willing to see this turn a realized project. If you have the technical know how, you have a part of the puzzle.\n\nYour collaboration is highly needed\nFriday 13th August 2021 6pm CET",

What Blockchain and crypto development is, is bring the freedom and simplicity of finance to the common man. If it is possible but not easy for the common man then there is work to be done, solution to be provided.\n\nI have already throw light on the part that talk about giving your seed to your lawyer, it completely compromises the security of your account, the own purpose of the crypto technology was to remove centralisation and control from finance, giving your seed to your lawyer is the opposite of the purpose of Blockchain and crypto currency..\n\nTo further clarify, I am NOT interested in your seed or anyone's seed, if I wanted to make a lot of money without putting in the effort of contributing to the crypto space, I would simply open a website, write a white paper that talk about this, follow some YouTube tutorial on how to create coin on bsc, provide liquidation in pancake swap allowing people to swap their bnb or other valuable coin for my coin, but that is not my interest. I know you might be sceptical but ask yourself if I have requested anything from you?, I haven't and wouldn't. I don't intend to create a centralised custodian or a mist of gaining access to people's fund, that will be disastrous, that is why I suggested a decentralised finance not a centralised one. One that doesn't have access to your value or account, doesn't hold your funds. \n\nFor more details as per those who are seeking for more clarification, I would be glad to provide it if only I know how you can be of help to this project, I'd like to know your expertise and how you can help please.\n\nOthers who are claiming this is already existing, please tell me which project is currently working on this, because I search and couldn't find none, only centralised custodian which is complete opposite of my proposal., Please if there any please list them in your comment.

I imagine it is more complicated than just having a node. Is there specific hardware to do that?\n\nIt's actually as simple as that. Anyone who runs a node is validating and propagating every block. It's the same with PoS. Granted, the only benefit of doing so whilst not mining yourself, is the security that comes with being able to validate your own incoming transaction.\n\nTo expand on that latter point, if you aren't using your node in any economically impactful way you aren't contributing in any meaningful way to the security of the network. If you are running SPV wallet software and not pointing it at your own node, or running a custodial lightning wallet, or only transacting via exchange, all your full node is doing is using up bandwidth and bogging down the network (more nodes = more p2p hops necessary to achieve consensus = slower block propagation and more orphaned blocks)",

There are 12-20k bitcoin nodes in operation on any given day, but if a random 75% of the non-mining, non-electrumx, non-merchant nodes cut out at any given moment there would be effectively zero impact on how smoothly the network runs. If you did the same with a coin where there are only ~100 nodes, there is a much higher chance you will be left with metaphorical network 'islands' of miners that become separated from the rest of the network (producing orphaned blocks and/or forks)",

If we think of wallets as the face of our browsing experience, perhaps a system where you accept certain tokens into your wallet to provide tracking capabilities and those tokens have a value that can be redeemed else where?\n\nWe do know that our data has value and that having a signular repository of it has made some organizations obscenely wealthy. It's also allowed for the weaponization of information by building social profiles about demographics. I'm honestly not sure how blockchain can break that model, but it's primary focus is decentralization so there is probably a way for it to be used by people more clever than I.",

            "selftext": "The idea of the **Counterstake** protocol for cross-chain transfers is very simple: when a user wants to transfer an asset from its home chain, they lock the asset on the home chain and claim the same amount of the imported asset on the foreign chain. When claiming, they put up a stake that is equal to the amount they claim. The stake is paid in the foreign chain's native asset. They'll get the stake back if the claim is legitimate, or lose it if the claim proves to be fraudulent. \n\nThis claim starts a challenging period. During this period, anyone can challenge the claim by counter-staking 1.5 the amount of the original stake if they think that the claim is fraudulent. The challengers are staking on the \"No\" outcome of the claim. If they are right and the original claim was fraudulent indeed, they stand to win the original stake from the claimant \u2014 a 66.7% ROI.  \n\nThe counterstake, if it happens, starts another challenging period, which is longer than the first one. During this period, anyone can support the original claim with their counterstakes if they believe that the original claim was legitimate and the first challenge was fraudulent. As soon as the total staked in favor of \"Yes\" reaches 1.5 times the total staked in favor of \"No\", \"Yes\" becomes the current outcome again and another challenging period starts.\n\nThis pendulum can continue for several periods until a challenging period expires without the opposing side overturning the current outcome. Then, all the staked money is distributed among those who staked on the winning outcome. If the winning outcome is \"Yes\", the original claimant also gets their imported asset, which is issued for them on the foreign chain.\n\nIn practice however, most claims will end after one period because there is objective truth that anyone who follows both the home and foreign chains can easily see. The truthful outcome is also the [Schelling point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)), and the community will quickly converge on the true outcome because everyone expects everyone else to stake on the true outcome. Even if a whale tries to repeatedly stake on the false outcome, the increasing length of the challenging periods will give the community enough time to mobilize and outweigh the whale's stake with the sum of many honest counterstakes. \n\nThis process of exporting an asset from its home chain and getting the same amount of newly issued imported asset on the foreign chain is called **expatriation**. The imported asset naturally represents the original asset on the foreign chain. After using the imported asset on the foreign chain, the same or another user can **repatriate** it back to the home chain by burning the imported asset on the foreign chain, claiming the burned amount on the home chain, and unlocking the previously locked asset on the home chain if the claim succeeds.\n\nAs long as the protocol works correctly and its watchdogs successfully challenge all fraudulent claims, the total amount of the imported asset issued on the foreign chain exactly matches the total amount of the exported asset locked on its home chain. Its total circulating supply stays the same, just part of the coins \"travel\" in foreign chains. \n\nThe described process might take rather long time as the user has to wait for at least one challenging period, and the period has to be long enough to give the challengers enough time to counterstake on fraudulent claims. The first challenging period is 3 days by default.\n\nHowever, **assistants** can accelerate the process for users by claiming the transfers for them and immediately paying the claimed coins to the user, less a reward to the assistant. The assistant will then wait for the challenging period to expire, defend the claim if necessary, and withdraw the claimed coins with profit. When sending a transfer, users indicate the reward they are prepared to pay to an assistant who picks their transfer. The reward should be large enough to cover the network fees on the destination chain and make a profit for the assistant that is adequate to the risk the assistant takes and the capital they lock in claims.\n\nAssistants can be either solo assistants or pooled ones that pool the capital from several investors and are operated by a manager. Pooled assistants are more likely to process large transfers. Assistants usually double as watchdogs and can challenge fraudulent claims as well as help users accelerate their transfers.\n\nBoth home and foreign chains should support some form of on-chain ***programmable agents*** that facilitate locking, claiming, issuing new tokens, and burning. Programmable agents are known by different names on different chains \u2014 [autonomous agents](https://obyte.org/platform/autonomous-agents) on Obyte, smart contracts on Ethereum, chaincode on Hyperledger Fabric. Most modern chains do support them: Obyte, Ethereum and other EVM based chains, EOS, etc, and Counterstake protocol enables interoperability between all such networks. \n\nIn depth look: [https://blog.obyte.org/counterstake-a-truly-decentralized-cross-chain-bridge-2d4a575b3f4a](https://blog.obyte.org/counterstake-a-truly-decentralized-cross-chain-bridge-2d4a575b3f4a)\n\nCounterstake Bridge website: [https://counterstake.org/](https://counterstake.org/)\n\n**If you want to try it out, remember that this is a new thing and you are likely to encounter various bugs, so start with small amounts!**",

I would guess that national elections would be a hard place to introduce this tech but I was thinking it may be cool to start at the lowest possible level and see if we can scale it up. \nWith that in mind I have been thinking of making something like this for my HOA.\n\n\nThe idea goes something like this: \n\nHOA members pay their fees monthly and are given tokens (say 10). Members can then give those tokens to vote on HOA decisions OR give them to a more politically savvy neighbor (a representative). This means they could throw all their votes into a single important matter or distribute them across multiple different votes.\n\nCooler yet, the HOA funds and spending become fully transparent through the public ledger and HOA members can choose how and verify that their money is well spent. \n\nAnyone could also start a vote by using a set amount of vote tokens (say 5).\n\nThe main issue I am seeing is that the purchasing (and minting) of the tokens would have to be centralized in a treasury of sorts. Not clear how I would get that block verification decentralized... Everyone can't check that everyone paid their dues.\n\nThoughts? Solutions?",

They cover some of this is in the discussion, but you can design your contracts such that there is no competition for redemption of UTXOs, and it's not problem to simply create a chain of unconfirmed transactions that will be included in the next block so that multiple people can interact with the same contract.\n\n\\>always been interested in the developments on the bitcoin cash cash chain. however ive thought the introduction of SLP and now this PMv3 and SmartBCH has tried to turn bitcoin cash into a jack of all trades but master of none.\n\nThe nice thing about SLP is that it didn't actually require any consensus changes. It's just data put in the OP\\_Return, and indexing and validation of SLP is done separately. So there were effectively 0 downsides to BCH's cash use case in adding SLP. (Besides the extra transactions competing for space, but that opens the can of worms as to whether [non-cash uses of the blockchain are spam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upTro-bAqIM). Short answer, I don't think they are, and you could spam in plenty of cash use-case ways too.)\n\nAnd SmartBCH will just be a sidechain so that, again, the BCH chain itself isn't really affected. Instead, BCH will just be the reserve asset for the contracts built on the sidechain, and the sidechain will scale independently.\n\n\\>i really dont know enough about these two technologies, with that said, im totally lost on how PMv3 works. BCH is limited by the script langauge (not turing complete) so how can dapps be possible? are you able to give a TLDR\n\nBCH's scripting language is  actually pretty powerful, and my understanding is that most of the popular applications built on ETH and other turing complete chains don't actually require turing complete-ness. Instead, you just need to be able to track the \"state\" of the contracts over time. Like they mention in the discussion, pmv3 does require a shift in perspective on how smart contracts are designed, since you aren't just writing (effectively) javascript for a virtual machine that actually acts like a computer, though. (Ethereum has global state, whereas BCH is a stateless network, but it can support stateful contracts.)\n\nInstead, you're using the ability to verify backwards to construct arrangements of UTXOs with spending constraints that can behave the exact same way as applications built on ETH (like decentralized exchanges).\n\nThe changes in PMv3 are actually quite minimal also. It's just a rearranging of the tx format to do that backwards validation. Similarly to how pay-to-script-hash transactions shifted the burden for supplying the unlocking script from the person sending to the address to the person spending from the address , PMv3 simply allows transactions to include a hash of a \"detached proof\" in a transaction, and that alone opens up these use cases for BCH.\n\nThese might be better sources for understanding PMv3 than the spec. Here's an overview:\n\n[https://blog.bitjson.com/pmv3-build-decentralized-applications-on-bitcoin-cash/](https://blog.bitjson.com/pmv3-build-decentralized-applications-on-bitcoin-cash/)\n\nHere's an example of how you could create a token standard in PMv3:\n\n[https://gist.github.com/bitjson/a440232cebba8f0b2b6b9aa5db1fdb37](https://gist.github.com/bitjson/a440232cebba8f0b2b6b9aa5db1fdb37)\n\nHere's where the proposal is being discussed, mostly:\n\n[https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/chip-2021-01-pmv3-version-3-transaction-format/265](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/chip-2021-01-pmv3-version-3-transaction-format/265)\n\nAnd I'm just a semi-technical enthusiast, so you'll probably get much better answers at the bitcoincashresearch link if you ask!\n\nu/chaintip",

It's just data put in the OP_Return, and indexing and validation of SLP is done separately.\n\nyeah thats a good point, and in fact bitcoin has a few things built ontop of it anyway, like microsofts decentralised identity tokens called ION. Veriblock also was using bitcoin at one point to secure their own china, they had to stop becuase the fees became too much. for some reason the bitcoin community thought their chain being used this way was a bad thing, when in reality it just gave bitcoin another use case.\n\nregarding spam, i dont think its too much of an issue, anyone who spams is just wasting money creating transactions, even if the fees are low, it adds up over time.\n\nill have a look at your links, thnaks",

For the last couple of months I have been following some blockchain communities on Reddit because I\u2019m trying to understand the atmosphere for my graduation thesis of Creative Business.\n\nThere are so many people asking such different questions.  In my opinion there is a great distinction between who is a developer and who is mainly here for trading. But there is a large group that has quite or somewhat of an understanding of blockchain technology that posts here. It seems they are not developers nor just traders.\n\nDo most of these people work with blockchain or in the blockchain industry, or are they/you here because of your interest in the technology? Or is there another reason?\n\nWhat do you think? I'm looking for any input here!\n\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong! I\u2019m not an expert on blockchain technology nor this community, just looking for some clarification.",

The tech is what got me interested in cryptocurrencies, and the tech is why I invested... Because I thought this was the Next Big Thing. So while I obviously invested with the hope of making a profit (like every investor before or since), the *reason* I invested was different. \n\nWhen I entered the space, it was still filled with crypto-anarchists as well, so I was instilled with many of their values. Crypto as independence from a government/bank, never keeping your coins on an exchange, never talking about how much crypto you have, that kind of stuff. New entrants to the space don't seem to care about that stuff. \n\nI also don't \"trade\". I buy every paycheck into projects with tech that I like and think will be around in the future. I typically don't intend to sell for years. I typically ignore price fluctuations (although I'm hesitant to buy when a coin pumps a huge amount). So I try not to be \"dumb\" with when I buy something, but I don't really sell much so don't consider myself a trader. \n\nSo I'm not a developer, and I'm not a trader.

Development efforts are coordinated by Coop\u00e9rative Kleros, a Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Coop\u00e9rative d\u2019Int\u00e9r\u00eat Collectif (SCIC) incorporated in France. All our research and code development are open source and free for anyone to use.](https://kleros.io/about/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt has come to my attention their system is effectively stealing money from people who apply to [Proof Of Humanity](https://kleros.io/about) and are challenged based on loosely interpreted [guidelines](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/Qmc7ag5XohnSAozvsKsLCUbvaFyasyLtyi3H7g3mmxznPU/proof-of-humanity-registry-policy.pdf). Jurors on kleros can be selected multiple times to vote on the same case, as seen on case [784](http://klerosboard.com/dispute/?id=784). Using the site that was just linked, Jurors can see the votes of other jurors, and insure they vote the same, and insure they do not lose their deposit. This is immoral as jurors who vote in the minority are punished by losing the deposit kleros requires from them to vote accurately. So even if the juror disagrees with the other, they are highly incentivized to vote against their own opinions, even if the letter of the document isnt being breached. If the vote goes against the submitter on these cases, they are required to PAY for an appeal in the price of 0.588 ether, and only have a day and a half to do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes to Jury selection, there seems to be a plutocracy as pointed out in their own sister company funding program [here](https://gitcoin.co/grants/599/proof-of-humanity). 20 accounts hold roughly 66 percent of the staked PNK token pool, the highest stake account of which has a 1 in 219 chance of being selected for all 3 juror positions, whereas an account with the minimum stake has a 1 in 11800 chance of being selected for ONE position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese people are taking advantage of users looking to get basic income, this seems to me like the rich shaking down the middle class down. Its abhorrent. And it should be changed, and if it cant be changed, it should be dismantled.",

                    "response": "I'm sorry this is going to seem blunt, but ideas are cheap. Execution is where the value is. If your idea is simple enough that someone can run off with your idea and cut you out entirely, maybe its not the revolutionary idea you think it is, and maybe you don't bring as much value to the table as you think you do.\n\nIf your idea is truly a brilliantly simple solution to a complex problem- then great! You're already most of the way there! All you have to do is gain the knowledge required to code a new coin yourself and reap all the profits.\n\nIf on the other hand, its a complex solution an will require a ton of expertise, it's probably a good idea to start talking about it openly with as many people as you possibly can. You'll have better luck finding the people you'll need to build it and others will be better able to direct you to people they know working in similar areas. In general, people (especially experts) are already working on stuff of their own, or whatever pays them expert wages. Nobody has the time to sit around waiting for someone to come around with an idea worth stealing then abandon whatever they're working on to take the gamble on building it. You on the other hand, will have the conviction it takes to see the project through. That's what's going to decide whether your idea takes off (or even gets built in the first place). Chances are, there are plenty of people out there who have come up with your idea in the shower, at a bar, or shooting the shit with their friends, they just haven't acted on it. You're not the first to have had it, so the fact that no one has ever thought of it isn't what's keeping it from becoming a reality, it's the fact that no one has moved on it.\n\nOf course, by all means, ask people to sign NDA's and don't share your idea with anyone, but don't be shocked when good developers just pass on even meeting up with you. People with \"the next big idea\" are a dime a dozen. I'm just a rando on the internet, but in my humble opinion your best chance of making something happen is talking about it with everyone you meet, and people will know you're the one trying to make it happen, so when someone else comes along with the right skill set, they might be able to put you two in touch. At the same time, start gaining some sort of expertise that will make you indispensable to the project, thus protecting yourself from your fear of someone stealing your idea. Or start drawing up a business plan, or in whatever way creating some sort of tangible value that is *yours* and go ahead an protect *that* as yours, so that the rocket can't take off without you. That'll protect you better than an NDA will.\n\nFinally, you might say \"Amazon steals people's ideas all the time! I'm totally justified in this fear.\" But I'd point out that Amazon doesn't steal just \"ideas,\" they steal products that are already built and proven to have a market. It's too expensive/risky for Amazon to just try ideas, which is why they wait for other people to build it, prove a market for it exists, *then* they steal it. Worry about *that*, but not about some rando developer taking your idea and running away like they do in the movies.",

Stealing ideas is not as profitable as seeing the original founder bring it to fruition (not to mention more scalable). \n\n\nAs an aside, even if someone copies your coin, it really doesn't matter. That's a risk you have to address anyways particularly in a field where it's trivial to copy contracts. Even if you have first mover advantage, anyone can copy it right after you publish. Need to think about platform, ecosystem, usecases, adoption. You should be 10 steps ahead such that anyone trying to copy cannot catch up.",

As this is my first coin, once the LP is unlocked, do I get the BNB that I put back into it? Also it says that the total value locked is almost 3x what I put in so not sure what happened there? Do I make fees while people are trading? \n\n  \nThank you and have a great day.",

Having a private key that can never be copied or backed up. \n\nCan you link to that paper? I mean, private key security is foundational in encryption altogether so, not backing up or copying the key is obviously ideal. I'm not sure how impactful that is to the design, however. Maybe I'm missing some context here.\n\nAlso I'm not sure what inconvenience you're referring to. Do you mean you want a key that _can_ be backed up or one that, intrinsically, cannot be backed up or copied?\n\nThe [One-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) is possibly an example of this, since the key is to be used only once. However, impractical. There are many variations of these kinds of one-time signature (OTS) schemes. They are the only known encryption schemes that don't rely on difficulty of the hardness of the mathematical problems -- in other words, are secure no matter how much computational power an attacker has.\n\n> I'm wondering how it would be practical to implement the BPQS signature scheme as detailed in the paper by the R3 foundation\n\nVery practical. It mostly relies on an underlying OTS scheme, which are plenty and readily-available. The implementation from the paper is cited and can be found [here](https://github.com/corda/bpqs).",

If you have a comprehensive resource that I should check out, like a book or some in depth video on this topic, please feel free to share it. Here are some of my questions:\n\n1. What is the difference between a private key generated by a 12-word seed and a 24-word seed, or any other number of words? Isn't the entropy different for these two? And if that's the case, how can they both be used to generate a Bitcoin's (for example) private key?\n2. Could I theoretically use a X-word seed using words from the BIP39 list to generate private keys? Are there min-max numbers of words that I could use?\n3. How many private keys are derived from a single mnemonic seed? Is it just a single master private key, from which more private keys are derived?\n4. I read that from a mnemonic seed I can generate private keys for all cryptos, even the ones that have not been published/created yet. How is that even possible? I really cannot grasp this concept. If I hold some coins in a multi-coin wallet like Exodus, for example, and they add a new coin to their list of supported coins, I know I can now access the private key for that coin, while still using the same account accessed through my original mnemonic seed. How???\n5. If I hold 5 different coins, for example, all under a multi-coin wallet with a single mnemonic seed, and then one day I decide to use a different wallet that does not support one of my coins, is there a way to actually extract a specific private key for a specific coin from the original seed, so that I can import that one coin's private key onto a different wallet manually?\n6. Is it true that by using a wallet with a seed, every transaction for every coin is processed through a different private-key / public-key pair? So a new private key is always generated after each transaction?\n7. I know that Monero specifically used 25-word seeds, but I can also have a Monero wallet into Exodus, which is generated for me when I first create my wallet using the default 12-word seed. How does that work? If I can create a Monero wallet using 12-word seeds, why would they natively use 25-word seeds instead? Does it matter in terms of privacy?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

The biggest problem with bitcoin is it\u2019s ability to stay decentralized and scale. It currently is building second layer solutions to scale while emphasizing its decentralized nature, in the future it could perhaps scale on chain somewhat more as technology gets better with no downside to its decentralized nature. The downside is less tps and higher fees but than can certainly change over time.The bitcoin coin itself is fundamental to its value and that\u2019s why there is no difference between the name of the bitcoin protocol and the coin bitcoin itself. Ethereum has a different name for the token ether and the protocol ethereum, but bitcoin is trying to be sound money whereas ethereum is not.

Its an asset with store of value  . He says thats why btc will never compete with gov currencies. \n\nSo you agree with Saylor in this area? You see, btc creator invented an asset now worth 1 trillion. \n\nIn history only steve jobs made something bigger as apple is worth 2 trillion. But apple made it , using its 10,000s employees and sweatshops in china. Steve Jobs was not a single guy who created that 2 tr value. \n\n\nThere are many precious metals companies who offer alternative to gov currencies and bonds store of wealth - and? Gov and Fed are not chasing them.\n\nSo is btc a currency or not?? Answer straight . Its too damn slow to technically be a currency. Also its waaaaaay to volatile. How can i price my products if btc can fall or rise 20% in 2 days?",

In that sense it's no different from FIAT, except that the monetary expansion is guaranteed to not change (from its design) and that for better or worse it's completely transparent (so if someone sends you 0.1 btc you can find out how much they own).\n2. In technology, nothing. Btc wanted to be a p2p currency, in that regard it was a successful proof of concept.\n3. To my knowledge no other tokens are built on or depend on the bitcoin network. They are separate blockchains that are completely separated from bitcoin, most tokens are built on ethereum but this could change.\n4. no\n5. You have to be trolling",

Crazy idea time, but bear with me.\n\nAs in, you only get X coins, and they are your coins forever until you die, but you can \"stake\" them freely in anything you so please... the exact details of which could vary (timed contracts, rewards, etc).  Basically, everyone gets a personal fixed supply of crypto that represents their voting power in a digital economy.  This could be used as a broad brush, democratic governance token - maybe like an overlay that applies to an entire ecosystem of crypto.\n\nThe number of coins in circulation would be directly proportional to the global population.  As in OP's concept, nobody is mining them.  But the supply is not fixed.  The lower the global population, the higher the value of the coin, because fewer are in circulation.  The supply would grow indefinitely, but coins belonging to dead people would not be relevant to price because only the living person could stake them.\n\nCurrently, crypto is mostly about transactions involving the coins themselves.  But there's a lot of other stuff that crypto can do.  And it's not to say that a project like this would take away the transactional properties of crypto... because all the other coins are still being traded, and this one can be used as sort of a governance overlay for transactions of different things.  Could be other coins, could be material goods and services, could even be ideas or policy.\n\nAlternate idea - you can actually increase your supply of these coins, but ONLY by using your fixed base supply of coins to vote for successful projects.  As a reward mechanism for staking.  So the only way to increase your share of the market relative to other users is to actively participate in informed decision making... of whatever this token is used to control.",

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nThis is my first post in this community. I am new to the crypto space generally. I am a mathematician with interests ranging across the foundations of logic, physics, computation, language, and psychology. I'm gradually cultivating my understanding of distributed ledgers, cryptographic protocols, concurrency, and general systems theory. I am posting here with mixed intentions: 1) to meet others with overlapping interests, to spark fruitful conversation, 2) to receive reading material and other media (videos, podcasts) which might help someone with a broad understanding of data structures and abstraction to better understand crypto tech.\n\nI also want to take the opportunity to share some of my musings concerning information, communication, protocol, and verity.\n\nObserving the history of proof mechanisms and consensus protocols, it seems that a number of complementary order parameters have emerged which frame the conditions of balance required by distributed ledgers. We have abutted against scaling limitations, and this abutment partitions projects according to their approach to balancing these complementary order parameters. Similar junctions have stalled our progress in other domains of knowledge, and I believe that these junctions reflect universalities in the semantic spaces we are exploring and designing. In these kinds of situations, it is the role of language and logic to clarify our view and reveal new solutions.\n\nAn example of linguistic dispersion taking place in the cryptosphere is around the idea of smart contracts. I recall hearing about Ethereum years ago, by pure chance, and at the time the idea of a smart contract did not make sense to me. The person hyping ETH to me was unable to converse about blockchains and what set Ethereum apart from Bitcoin, and so at the time I treated it as any other scam sweeping through. The name problem is a reflection of the greater language problem we find ourselves immersed in. This language problem goes back very far. Any time a new \"field of semantics\" arises, it is because people want to progress in their ideations about technology but lack the language for \"semiotic scaling\" into new scales of meaning. Quantum foundations is deeply wounded by this kind of semantic divide concerning some syntactic utility (in that case, operator theory).\n\nWordspace which I see as particularly central to the advance of information distribution and transmutation:\n\n[Utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility)\n[Sensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis)\n[Modality](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+modality)\n[Structure](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/stuff,+structure,+property)\n[Quantity](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/space+and+quantity)\n[Space](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/space+and+quantity)\n[Context](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/context)\n[Type](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/type)\n[Conviction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network)\n[Simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_(computer_science))\n[Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_control)\n[Current](https://math.mit.edu/juvitop/pastseminars/notes_2019_Fall/debray.pdf)\n[Field](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~wlawvere/ToposMotion.pdf)\n[Confusion](https://www.ellerman.org/intro-logical-entropy/)\n\nI believe that the semiotic distillation of these terms will eventually improve our collective state of being.\n\nWhat writers and thinkers are working at this level of generality? Where can I find conversations taking place in this register?",

What is the harm in allowing everyone to stake?\n2. Why don't AVAX validators need to store the whole chains history like PoW chains do?\n3. Why is Avalanche Consensus technically probabilistic? What event could cause the chain to overturn itself? (I understand the \"longest chain\" in PoW, but how could a transaction be rolled back in avalanche?)\n\nFurthermore, is this understanding of the consensus protocol and its terminology correct?\n\n1. a transaction is broadcasted to the entire network\n2. the network randomly picks X amount of validators to determine if a transaction is valid \n3. These validators then choose K amount of validators to ask if they think the transaction is valid (subsampled voting?)\n4. This process repeats for a few rounds (network gossip?) until all validators have agreed and the original \"X\" amount of validators have reached a super majority\n5. Once agreed on, the transaction is finalized\n\nThanks everyone for taking a look at this. It means a lot to me!\n\nBONUS QUESTION: Since AVAX has a hard cap, what happens when the staking rewards run out? How will validators be incentivized to continue staking?",

You got it right, except, we know which transactions are valid, so validators dont ask for transaction validity but inclusion.\n\nYou can vew the system so that each transaction is a state change, the system was in state A, and with the new TX its now in state B.\nThe consensus is theee to make sure all nodes agree the system should go from A->B.\nWe all know B is a valid state, but do we transition to it?\n\n\nThe amount of staked coins depends on the design of the protocol. In general, the stake is what allows the protocol to make some game theory assumptions and enforce good behaviour by penalties for bad, and rewards for good.\nThe exact amount is a product of many variables such as:\n- Desired number of validating nodes\n- Decentralization\n- Sybil resistance\n- Rewards / coin issuance\n- Operating costs of running a node\n- etc..\n\nIf theres a fixed supply of AVAX, the protocol must sustain its validators with transaction fees alone.

I know in Avalanche's documentation, they use it to refer to each cycle of voting within a single block production, but that's just their poor choice of terms. Each of Avalanche's 3 main chains takes 2s to finality based on adjustable parameters, so in terms of finality, it's deterministic, not probabilistic.",
