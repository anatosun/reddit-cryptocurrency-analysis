You can be set up in seconds with as many wallets as you want. Thousands even. And you already have one, if you go to the sodogetip website and grab your keys.\n\nJust stick your wallets in a text file, store it on multiple removable media along with a copy of the coinb.in website and put them in safe places where they won\u2019t all get destroyed in a disaster. Done!\n\nAnd while you\u2019re at coinb.in, have a play with any wallet at all to see how it all works. Yes, you can even use those top 100 richest wallets.\n\nThings NOT to do:\n\n1.
