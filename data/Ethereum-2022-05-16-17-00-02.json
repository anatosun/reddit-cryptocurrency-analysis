Each project within PYE\u2019s ecosystem lends ground-breaking utility aimed at providing advantages to both the holders and projects who interact with the ecosystem.\n\n\u2714\ufe0fPYESWAP is the first swap to utilize BNB, and now ETH, to power the BuyBack mechanism. With this revolutionary tech, projects will no longer need to sell tokens on the market as the taxes are taken from the BNB BEFORE it buys the tokens.\n\n\u2714\ufe0fNO MORE CONTRACTS SELLING TOKENS! Thus allowing tokenomics without red candles interrupting the long-term health of the project. \n\n\u2714\ufe0fThis is just a small piece of the PYE\u2026 of which holders earn 40% of net profits on PYESWAP through the Innovative Staking Reward System, the Circle of PYE. As well as from projects launching via MoonForce, the only Gateway Launchpad into Swap 2.0 Tech. \n\n\u2714\ufe0fPYE\u2019s innovative technologies and frictionless utility are making waves in the crypto-sphere. The goal is to lower the barrier of entry, paving the way for cryptocurrencies mass adoption. PYECharts, PYESwap, and PYE\u2019s NFT marketplace will seamlessly integrate with other platforms. A portion of the fees will then be redistributed back to PYE holders.\n\n\ud83e\udd67The flood gates are opening; join the community today to learn about PYE on ETH!\ud83e\udd67  \n\n\n[https://discord.gg/YdaAjnTR](https://discord.gg/YdaAjnTR)",

But when there aren't other valid transactions, it is easy to spot the block isn't as full as it should. And when the transactions actually are on an L2, you're beginning to censor an L2, which becomes way easier to spot too. \n\nBut if it's many validators colluding to censor at the same time the same wallet(s), it becomes easier to spot even on the L1 and when there are many other transactions, as it is proven by time itself. This is solved through L0 consensus and a fork away from bad actors.",

If you only run your validator on one computer this shouldn't happen by accident, absent a serious bug. There are some tools to help you avoid getting slashed if you migrate validators from one computer to another.\n\nIIUC there's currently no protocol rule against censoring transactions, but you couldn't do it unless you had a huge share of staking power. As of the current design it would probably be an extra-protocol thing, ie we'd see that over half the stakers were censoring and do a hard fork to delete their stake. There's a plan to do something called crLists to allow censorship to prevented in-protocol; I'm not sure if it slashes people who refuse to put transactions in blocks, or if it just considers the censoring blocks invalid.
