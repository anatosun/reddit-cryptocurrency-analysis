            "selftext": "One of the most prominent solutions to achieve the requirements for transaction confidentiality, are ZK Proofs, since they can prove to the verifier that they know the value x in the world of cryptography, without disclosing any other information apart from the fact that they know the value of x.\n\n\nZero-Knowledge proof is able to transmit information like authentication with better security, to build a secure channel for the users without revealing anything unnecessary to avoid data leakage. \n\n\nPolygon is one of the first blockchains to integrate ZKP by introducing Polygon ID,  scalable blockchain ID with ZK-based privacy. Polygon ID is decentralized, private by default, offers on-chain verification and permissionless attestation. \n\n\nI personally think that blockchains with ZK Proofs are the perfect fit for enterprise use, mainly because they can do business and conduct transactions without revealing any type of info. \n\n\nAfter doing some research I learned that ZK Rollup is actually better than Optimistic Rollup, since they\u2019re solving fundamentals issues with Optimistic like eliminating a nasty tail risk, reducing withdrawal times, enabling fast transaction confirmations and exits in practically unlimited volumes, and introducing privacy by default.",

Great innovation that I will really love to see more of it.",

Or what the true numbers and statistics are\n\nYou can boo as much as you want. It doesn't make it any less true\n\nIf you want any kind of trustless system, stick with L1's.
