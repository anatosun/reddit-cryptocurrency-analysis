If you hear places like Palestine talk about btc not only is there stupid fees, but in some instances gov lackeys require a wife, daughter,sister be slept with to allow money to come in to save a family from starvation. It also helps marginalized people and people living in dictatorships avoid having all their wealth outright just be stolen. It helps those in countries with failing currencies avoid losing everything by opting out of that currency. It banks those who have no way of being banked. I appreciate the conversation  OP but if that is your view you gotta keep on consuming knowlege on btc and you'll notice the difference.",
