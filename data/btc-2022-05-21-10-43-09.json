BTC can't grow - and as you point out on-chain txs have flattened out (and actually fallen) since 2017., hence the lower fees. This is a serious security concern on the long run, since miners subsidies get cut in half every 4 years and if the prize stops doubling every 4 years BTC is in serious trouble. Problem is that BTC fundamentals won't be able to carry price appreciation, since on-chain transactions are not rising - propably because people know now that BTC cannot scale and has moved to other chains instead for usage. Also, Lighting Network (aside from not really working at scale) does not improve the onchain security in the long run either - quite the contrary actually.\n\nBCH might still have lower adoption than BTC (though I suspect it actually has higher adoption when it comes to payments and brick and mortar shops), but it can grow 1000x more today without having ANY problems with scaling. Planned development will up that number an order of magnitude at least in the near term.\n\nSo BCH actually has a viable path when block subsidy goes down. Sure BCH prize is still low, but if it continues to grow in usage, it is only a question of time before prize and fees from onchain transactions will outpace BTC and hence BCH end up as the chain with the most security.\n\nAlso, BCH already has better features, besides higher blockspace, such as better smart contract script features, scaling tech, faster and generally more efficient mempool code in all of the node implementations, ditto with validation and far better node implementation decentralization already today. In addition, it has a kickass EVM smartcontract sidechain called SmartBCH that nukes the competion in scalability, speed, ease of use and cheap fees compared to the competition.\n\nBCH certainly has the fundementals in place, make no mistake about that.\n\nWhat is missing is still major whale adoption and/or critical mass adoption and hence network effect. When/if that happens BCHs price will melt faces far beyond what was seen in 2017.",
