There's only been twice when there was a substantial fee market on bitcoin - 2017 and Q1 2021. Was the BCH hard fork really necessary?",

It doesn't matter if none, one or both of those chains succeds or fails at any metric - the fork was a matter of subjective opinion at the time.",

With no more additional onchain transactions possible, the only way for BTC to maintain its current security is for fees to double at least every four years. But as you point out, despite the popularity of BTC, fees have not trended up as they predicted. People simply aren't going to spend $50 on a transaction on a regular basis. They'll exit instead.",

It appears that BTC fees have already hit their lifetime highs, and security can only go down from here. \n\nBCH earns fees from adoption. The only limit to BCH security is adoption. We don't know whether BCH's security model has failed, because it lacks adoption. The worst we can say at this point is that it lacks adoption.\n\r  \n>Also you know that if BTC collapses the whole cryptocurrency market will collapse alongside it?

BTC can't grow - and as you point out on-chain txs have flattened out (and actually fallen) since 2017., hence the lower fees. This is a serious security concern on the long run, since miners subsidies get cut in half every 4 years and if the prize stops doubling every 4 years BTC is in serious trouble. Problem is that BTC fundamentals won't be able to carry price appreciation, since on-chain transactions are not rising - propably because people know now that BTC cannot scale and has moved to other chains instead for usage. Also, Lighting Network (aside from not really working at scale) does not improve the onchain security in the long run either - quite the contrary actually.\n\nBCH might still have lower adoption than BTC (though I suspect it actually has higher adoption when it comes to payments and brick and mortar shops), but it can grow 1000x more today without having ANY problems with scaling. Planned development will up that number an order of magnitude at least in the near term.\n\nSo BCH actually has a viable path when block subsidy goes down. Sure BCH prize is still low, but if it continues to grow in usage, it is only a question of time before prize and fees from onchain transactions will outpace BTC and hence BCH end up as the chain with the most security.\n\nAlso, BCH already has better features, besides higher blockspace, such as better smart contract script features, scaling tech, faster and generally more efficient mempool code in all of the node implementations, ditto with validation and far better node implementation decentralization already today. In addition, it has a kickass EVM smartcontract sidechain called SmartBCH that nukes the competion in scalability, speed, ease of use and cheap fees compared to the competition.\n\nBCH certainly has the fundementals in place, make no mistake about that.\n\nWhat is missing is still major whale adoption and/or critical mass adoption and hence network effect. When/if that happens BCHs price will melt faces far beyond what was seen in 2017.",

Really I\u2019m just conceding the point that BTC is \u201cmore secure\u201d in that it is more secure for high value (million dollar) transactions. I probably shouldn\u2019t engage with the obstinate BTC folk but I feel if people read reasonable back and forth in the comments here that BCH advantages will click- that\u2019s how I ended up following BCH.",

Just because a house is not worth robbing, doesn't mean that it is secure (that's the price side of things).\n\nNode count and distribution is another important aspect and BCH (BitcoinABC) is highly centralized. One of the hackers a while back claimed that 98% of all nodes are located in one single rack... which might be a bit of an overstatement, but right before the China exodus 58% of all nodes were running on the Alibaba servers in China. That's a bunch... even today research shows that network centralization is a big issue for BCH. China exodus has been great for BTC decentralization, forcing the miners and node operators to move operations all over the world. \n\nDevelopers for BTC are significantly more responsive to issues and threats, and I believe they are significantly more competent than the BCH lot, but that can be argued. \n\nTransaction speed is actually about same between BTC and BCH networks... BCH can take minutes or hours, BTC can take seconds. What BTC has is the lightning network which provides true instant transactions, which BCH doesn't have. There is significant security in having the payment transactions on an L2 network, because you can screen and detect fraudulent transactions (and even prevent them) before they hit the L1 blockchain.\n\nThat's just a starter.\n\nGo read more about things... and don't be insulting and then tell people not to take offense.

But I must ask you again, how are are any of these part of the inherent security model? What is baked into the code/technology that produces an inferior outcome for bch?\n\nEven if I concede these points (which, come on, \u201c98% of all nodes on a single rack\u201d according to some hacker- you can do better than this) these would be great points if the argument was why BTC is currently a more secure network.

It is very noble of you to ignore the two largest aspects of the PoW security, I mean, talk about a strawman argument... WHOA... but at least you are admitting that BCH security regarding price and hash rate is crap... so that's progress. \n\nI also find it absolutely hilarious that nearly everyone on here spewed BTC centralization hatred and once the China ban went into effect all of the sudden BTC became the most decentralized digital currency. That's important. That is actually VERY important because China used to have political influence on BTC price... remember that BTC FUD in the past related to China. Today it doesn't matter. US has influence over all crypto because it is the largest economy in the world, not because it has the most hash power. If US banned PoW mining, it would be a tiny blip on the radar toward greater decentralization... but that's never going to happen. \n\nEveryone has this argument here that the larger block size makes payments faster on BCH, the thing is the 1MB block size of BTC forces decentralization and prevents humongous pools from forming. BCH has a miner pool problem, if you look it up you'll see that I am right. \n\nSo to ignore decentralization, or the lack thereof, when viewed from security aspect is just... well ignorant.\n\nAnyways, I have to go to a party. I think you can do plenty of research into BCH to understand the security flaws. Like I said, L2 benefit of Lightning is great because it allows you to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions before it hits your L1 blockchain... you quickly ignored that.\n\nNow let's keep focus... this is a discussion between BCH and BTC security... not just individual security of isolated components... k?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood",

The risk would be abated by awaiting for more confirmations.  It seems likely that waiting a day for 150 cofirmations would equalize the risk.\n\nAssuming that the BTC network were operating under overload as it was in December 2017,  it\u2019s entirely possible that the delay between sending and receiver acceptance could be shorter with BCH.\n\nA well designed system should be immune to user error, so calling users stupid is misplaced.  If there is any stupidity it is more likely in the system designers,  specifically the architects and designers of the \u201cfee market\u201d.  But there is a better explanation, which is corruption, induced behind the scenes.  We know that there were evil DDoS attacks on large block nodes.  In August 2015 there were many DDoS attacks on large block bitcoin nodes.  My node was DDoS\u2019d twice in one day.  These attacks took out the entire internet service for six rural communities along with their long distance and emergency 911 telephone service.",
