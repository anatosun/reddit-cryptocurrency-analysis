Iv done research because I\u2019m curious what the incentive will be too process transactions for miners will be. All I have come up with is that their will be a transaction fee but no information on how much? How do they decide what a transaction fee will cost if no entity is in charge and how do they maintain the transaction fee at a rate which will still compensate the miners enough to continue mining/processing transactions? Also it should continue getting more expensive to process transactions as there are more blocks being added to each Bitcoin and as other electricity and other such costs rise for the miners.",

Once it has all been mined, that's it, and we have known from the get go how much there will be, and the rate at which it is produced slows with each halving. No more can ever be created. USD is always increasing in amount which as you mentioned, lowers its true value with no end. \n\nSo yes, there is more Bitcoin being produced, but its better to think of it like how people are still mining gold. Its harder to mine because we have found all the easiest bits, and its rarity is a huge source of its value even as we get more globally each day.",

The block reward gets reduced by 50% every 210,000 blocks solved, which is approximately every 4 years. So over time the incentive for Bitcoin miners to secure the Bitcoin network transitions from block rewards to transaction fees. After all of the bitcoins have been mined, the Bitcoin miners will only be incentivized by transaction fees and Bitcoin will be completely inflation free.\n\nThe Bitcoin mining difficulty automatically adjusts every 2016 blocks which is approximately every two weeks. The mining difficulty automatically increases or decreases after 2016 blocks depending on the time between the previous 2016 blocks. If the time between those blocks averages out to less than ten minutes, then the mining difficulty will increase and miners will become less profitable. If the time between those blocks averages out to more than ten minutes, then the mining difficulty will decrease and miners will become more profitable. So if some Bitcoin miners stop mining bitcoin because it's no longer profitable for them, the mining difficulty will decrease and it will become more profitable to mine bitcoin.\n\nBlock space is limited. So Bitcoin users must bid on inclusion in the limited block space by way of transaction fees. Higher demand for block space = higher transaction fees.",

Possible but the demand of energy is always going up soo yea energy costs will always go up unless they find an infinity energy source that would temporarily reduce energy costs but again energy demand always rises so even if they somehow figured out how to supply the demand the demand would likely just get even higher as sufficient energy supply would cause a massive leap in technology and demand would skyrocket. Again that\u2019s mostly theoretical but based on the fact that energy demand always rises long term I would cut my left nut off if energy costs didn\u2019t rise for the next 100 years.",
