Please read the disclaimer, guidelines, and rules before participating.**\n\nRules:\n\n* All [sub rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethereum/about/rules/) apply in this thread.\n* Discussion topics must be related to Ethereum.\n* Behave with civility and politeness. Do not use offensive, racist or homophobic language.\n* Comments will be sorted by newest first.\n\nUseful Links:\n\n* [Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org)\n* [ETHMerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/)\n\n**Reminder**\n\n/r/ethereum is a community for discussing the technology, news, applications and community of Ethereum. **Discussion of the Ether price or trading is not allowed.** Please keep those discussions to [/r/ethfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance) and [/r/ethstaker](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**\n\nThere are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.\n\n**When is Eth2 launching?**\n\nEth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. \"The Merge\", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.\n\nVisit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about \"The Merge\".\n\n**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**\n\nNo, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.\n\n**How can I stake my ETH?**\n\nThe best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.\n\n* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details\n\n**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**\n\nLike most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.\n\n**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**\n\nEthereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.\n\nAdditionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.\n\nWhile rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.\n\n**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**\n\nThe most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre there questions you'd like to see added? Leave a comment below.",

Theoretically it could be possible for a virus to exploit one of these vulnerabilities to push a compromised firmware onto the wallet (making it possible for the wallet to display a false destination address for a transaction, or things like this), but:\n1. The practicality of this form of attack varies between different wallet brands and wallet models, based on the vulnerabilities. In general I'd say that this isn't an issue, as malware needs to be specifically designed for a given wallet brand/model and may require some impractical techniques to fully compromise the wallet, but I'd also say that if you're worried about this, then you should do some research into whether a given wallet has any known vulnerabilities.\n2. This form of attack *probably* couldn't let the malware steal your seed phrase, as it's held within the separate storage chip that's designed to be resilient to both physical and digital attacks. This form of attack generally exploits vulnerabilities in the unsecure SoC, so at most it could compromise that and *maybe* issue requests to the secure storage chip, but the secure storage chip shouldn't ever send your seed phrase back to the unsecure storage chip. Think of some malware having your hardware wallet display your intended destination address, when in reality the destination address is actually one owned by the developer of the malware. That's the sort of stuff that's theoretically possible.\n\n>  I figured once they connect to the internet they become vulnerable just like everything else.\n\nIt's because the part that you want to keep safe (your seed phrase) is not accessible from the internet-connected device. To get the seed phrase, the internet-connected device would need to go through the unsecure SoC, then through the secure storage chip, which it's designed to defend against. Without having physical access to the device, this just isn't possible, hence the seed phrase considered to be invulnerable once it's in the secure storage chip. Though, having said that, a hardware wallet obviously doesn't protect against you giving your seed phrase away yourself, so obviously don't do that.",

And I'm sure they could set up an automated system where it tries random phrases over and over. All automated.  So what's stopping them from doing that?   I'm sure there's millions of wallets around the world. Shouldn't be too hard to crack a few. After all it's only 12 to 18 words.\n\n\nReason I ask is because I watched a refresher video on how to set up a mobile wallet and move money in and out. And when you do the backup it generates 12 words or however many words. And then when you start typing those words after the first 3 letters it will even auto predict the word for you. And so all someone needs to know is those 12 words and boom they have full access to your funds.\n\nI'm sure hackers know which words each wallet uses so they can easily set up a bot that has a word list that uses all those words and inputs them all in random order X amount of times on repeat to try to crack wallets.\n\nSo what's stopping hackers from doing it?",
