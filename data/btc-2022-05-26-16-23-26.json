The ALTERNATIVE Bitcoin - unlike *that other Bitcoin,* **BCH companies receive no funding from iFinex, we're not a supporter of the Tether scheme, and we don't form part of Tether's \"backing assets.\"**\n\nOther people can keep jumping on the TETHERED BITCOIN bandwagon.  But you and me, we're gonna stick to the principle of UNTETHERED PEER TO PEER ELECTRONIC CASH FOR THE WHOLE WORLD, and we're gonna get that message out there as wide and far as possible.\n\nGreat job /u/rey4486 !!\n\nYou may be asking, what about the other contestants?  It was a very close contest with a 2nd place runner up that just lost by a nose.  I'm going to celebrate that entry with its own post.  Stay tuned!!\n\n___ \n\nEdit: now watch so-called \"Bitcoiners\" rush in to defend Tether like I insulted their Mom",

It is free because everyone uses it as expected and no one is siphoning it somewhere else and selling it. \n\nRunning a single miner for fun and giggles and for the learning experience: cool. Running a mine to make a profit bad. In the long run you will hurt everyone around you (If the school finds out fast) but surely everyone that comes after you. There might be new rules or they might charge for electricity etc. Not cool.",
