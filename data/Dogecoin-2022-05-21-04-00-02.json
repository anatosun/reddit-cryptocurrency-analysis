Also, more the network is active the easier it will be for more acceptance so small tips, purchasing merchandise, donation and anything that will keep the network active is good. \n\nRegarding wallets, for me the best wallet to store your hard earn coin is in a hardware wallet; you can store your coin in your wallet of preference but [hot wallets are an issue](https://www.zdnet.com/finance/blockchain/malware-is-targeting-crypto-wallets-says-microsoft-heres-how-to-protect-yourself-better/). You can read about it in the link provided.\n\nLet's get to the moon faster and happy trails.\n\nWe are a Doge Nation and we do only good.",

So if you buy a -1x token for a coin, that token will borrow a coin from a lender and when you sell that -1x token back, they will return it. The money you use to pay for the token is your security here. \n\nThe markets do not care if you bought or borrowed a coin. A sale is a sale. \n\nThe more lent out coins there are, the more sales can happen that dump the price down. They have to buy it back eventually, but temporarily that dumps the price.\n\nFewer coins lent out = less dumping and shorter time for each short-position. More coins lent out = shorters can do whatever they want because there is enough supply.",
