Looking at the transaction history, I can see my recent transfer, but nothing that indicates having received anything more. I\u2019ve been using Ledger since March and just recently purchased two more for a couple of buddies new to Bitcoin. I have never seen an issue like this and can only assume this is a bug. Has anyone experienced this same issue? \n\nFor folks who are curious, I\u2019m not yet a full coiner. Dollar cost averaging in has allowed me to build up to roughly 20% of the way there. This recent event shows my account at 44%. \n\nHope everyone is having a great week! I have always appreciated the community coding and bitcoin has given me.",

That\u2019s about a 1700% return in 5 years or 333% annually. \n\nTherefore, if you had invested in bitcoin at the time, In order to successfully hedge against 10% inflation on your 1000$ account, you would only have needed to have invested around 33$ (calculation was done without compounding inflation).
