Bots, moonbois, WSB morons, etc. Not exactly the types this community supports, usually.\n\n> Let's invite over their ecosystem developers\n\nWhy? So they can fuck up this project?\n\n>  Let's invite over their... good folks from there into Bitcoin Cash.\n\nWhy? If they wanted to be part of this community they would already be a part of this community.\n\n> Invite them over nicely without prejudice.\n\nGood luck with that. I hope you don't expect there to be 0 prejudice if they do decide to come over.\n\n> all the failed crypto ecosystems out there. \n\nThey usually fail for good reasons. Nothing stopped them from being members of this community before or after. They'll likley prefer to move on to some other get-rich-quick scam, instead of true p2p electronic cash.\n\nI think I'll leave with just saying the above.",
