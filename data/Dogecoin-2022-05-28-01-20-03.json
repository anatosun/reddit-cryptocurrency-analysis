They would send you an email that say you need to update your info and log on through a link in the email which would take you to a site that resembles your exchange or wallet provider and then it would record all the info and possibly give the hackers remote access to your computer.   That's my basic understanding of how they get you but I'm not entirely sure how the scam works but think it's a fair amount of work and this is the first step to confirm a target.",
