Is it a shot at poor people or something? I can't buy food and gas with silver or gold bars at the store either. What does that have to do with anything?\n\nThis might as well say \"You poors better sell your shit because tough times are ahead. You can't aford to hold bitcoin AND expect to buy necessities like food.\"\n\nWhether you like bitcoin or not this article is trash.",
