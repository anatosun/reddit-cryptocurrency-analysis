I have been completely in the dark during this whole time.\n\nNow they tell me my account was clearly hacked from a remote IP address and funds were stolen, but there is nothing they can do.\n\nHow can a company that is about to have an IPO not have any telephone support and treat their customers this way? \n\nHopefully the continuing bad press that is posted here will force Coinbase to change their ways, but if not, a bank that is run this poorly seems like very poor stock investment in the future.\n\nI hope anyone who reads this will learn from my mistake and not do business with such a shady company.",

Only way I ever got through was coming to this subreddit and complaining, that finally got the recovery process started.\n\nI'm so glad I used the vault wallet, the 48 hour waiting period for withdrawals really saved me. Also the automated number to dial in and lock your account even if you've been hacked is really good.\n\nI wish more people would take cybersecurity more seriously. I know I didn't until I was hacked and it was too late. Now I use hardware security keys, unique passwords for every account, app based 2FA, non-admin account for PC, no browser extensions etc etc...",

That's why they make the vaults with 48 hour waits and secondary email approval. But with a bad malware infection hackers can work around it.\n\nAnother good luck I had was a backup phone number in my coinbase account which got an alert a withdrawal was initiated. This was after the hacker removed my primary phone number but I guess coinbase has a policy that you can't remove all the phone numbers. If I had missed that text I could have lost everything.\n\nAnother thing hackers do is delete emails containing password change and email change alerts. Or even create forwarding rules in your account to steal your emails.",

Fail. \nContact T-Mobile - they don\u2019t know but will look into it\nContact the local police and file a report? Contact that FBI site?
