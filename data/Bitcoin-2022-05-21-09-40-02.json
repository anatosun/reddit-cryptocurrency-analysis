After watching what has happened over the last year, I'm not discouraged in the slightest. The truth of the matter is, for me at least, the long term financial gain from crypto is much better than a savings account. I also have a 401k that is doing well.\n\nWhat I've learned over this last year is just HOW bad the banks are ripping off the public. It's disgusting so as soon as I deposit my wages I pay my bills, plan for the couple weeks until I'm paid again and the rest goes into crypto.\n\nAnother belief I have is that the younger generation of Gen Z will be moving a lot of their finances from a bank to crypto because they will have been raised watching it do what it does best decentralizing away from the evil banks, CEOs and politicians who only want to keep the common people down (sorry for the run on sentence).",

You HODL until a car drops to $0.01.  That means the car which cost tens of thousand of dollars to make has lost its manufacturer all that money.  And you have no car.  Everyone loses.  Meanwhile an inflationary economy stimulates spending.  That car that costs $0.01 today will cost $0.02 in an hour.  Tomorrow it might be over $1000.  Next week it could be $100000.  So you spend all your money as quickly as possible to take advantage of the current firesales.  Right now as we speak I'm stocking up on appliances at Best Buy, something I rarely do.",
