Could have as many as you want. Still have to stash it but if lost or stolen or whatever, highly unlikely anyone will be able to use it.\n\nYou lose the paper and your done.\n\nYou could also email the encrypted document to yourself. I have like 50 or 60 thousand emails. It would just be sitting there amongst them.\n\nHave accounts on google, Microsoft, & yahoo so it would always be out there.",

                    "response": "I know this isn't popular but I actually think digitization is fine if you do it properly. If you aren't as technically adept, using a simplified method such as a reputable password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass), isn't that bad of an idea. They're well trusted by Fortune 500 enterprises and have gone through audits and have a proven record of storing your credentials using zero knowledge encryption.\n\nIf you are comfortable encrypting files yourself, encrypting a seed phrase text file, then storing it in cloud storage such as DropBox, Drive, OneDrive, etc (similar to how KeePass works) is fine too.\n\nLook, there's obviously risks with digitization of passphrases--but for those using software wallets, you already did it when you decided to use software wallets. Everyone acting like you'll suddenly get hacked is absurd. Malware, key loggers, etc do exist, but they're less common than people think. So many things are digitized on a regular basis, and people take photos of things too. We need to stop mixing what is technically possible (AI photo processing and stealing seed phrases) versus what is actually happening. If all your photos are constantly being scanned and its contents actually revealed to others, we'd be screwed already. Apple,Microsoft, Google, Amazon are trillion dollar companies that store likely exabytes of photos. Of course your photos are being scanned, but these are companies that stake their entire revenue on using your data in a way that doesn't reveal to everyone else the contents. If employees were looking at your nudes, if employees were stealing home secrets, business secrets, etc, that would immediately signal a downfall in these companies.\n\nNow I'm not saying that you should take photos of your seed phrases, but if my point is its not as dangerous as you think. If you think you will automatically get compromised, I'd be willing to test it out with you. Put $1 in a disposable seed phrase. Type it in your computer. Does it automatically disappear? TAke a photo of the words. Does it automatically disappear? I'm willing to bet unless you [deliberately infect your computer](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/mVLnKx9K_Aw) with a bunch of malware ahead of time, it will be fine.\n\nWhat people advocate with physical storage almost never account for the odds of physical loss, and then treat the probability of loss via digitization as 100%. Look, your home is more likely to burn down. Your safe is more likely to be broken into. Your handwritten note is more likely to be lost or misplaced. Someone is likely to stumble upon your seed phrases hidden in your home. All of this is far more likely than encryption being broken provided you used a strong passphrase.\n\nAnd the advantages of digitization never get talked about too:\n\n1. In a Ukraine like situation, smuggling physical goods is tough and you CAN be caught. What are you going to do then? I'd rather trust my data in the cloud and flee with nothing. Do you think you want to take the chance that Russian soldiers find you with a USB stick and torture you for that information? Or worse yet see your cryptosteel? Good luck with that.\n\n2. You are vacationing and your home gets burglarized. Your neighbor calls you and tells you they called the cops, but a lot of stuff was stolen already. What are you going to do then? Fly home? Cut your vacation short? Or guess what? Instead of wondering if your Trezor got stolen or if your backup phrases  got discovered, I load up my backup, create a new software wallet via an open source wallet, move my funds over and I stop worrying. Once I return home, I can assess the situation--buy a new hardware wallet if needed, but at least for a temporary basis, my funds are safe.\n\n3. People who come up with \"creative\" key splitting schemes like putting half at their mom's basement, giving a copy to their brother/sister, best friend, etc are likely doing more harm than good. There's actually [a term for it](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Shamir_Secret_Snakeoil). Most of you think you're smart, but compared to a full seed phrase, you already cut your entropy orders of magnitude by breaking it up and handing it to people. Moreover, you're now fully trusting that people won't combine them to screw you over. Is that trust really a lower probability than encryption being broken?\n\nI'm disturbed how many of you are so anti-digitization when Blockchain is based on encryption and math. So many of you don't use password managers, which is why I see so many CeFi hackings on a daily basis. If you talk to people who actually value digital security, almost everyone is comfortable with crypto seed phrases in their password managers.",

Always the same number in the list.The 5th, 14th, 21st, or whatever.Also one complete list is fake. (Only I know which one)The correct words are in the fake list and only I know where they are.Document then encrypted.Then email it to myself and it will be sitting amongst thousands of others in my inbox accessible from anywhere If I need it.Don\u2019t see why anyone would go looking for it or even know what it was if they somehow got ahold of it.And if someone did get it, no list would work.\n\nWill also keep a thumb drive around.",
