This issue is not isolated to the Euro. Unfortunately, the same scenario is being played out in every economy globally,\" he added.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

The most positive effect of a decentralized currency would be it's effect on governments.  They would be forced to abandon income tax and money printing, and shift to economically superior land tax systems.\n\nCrytpo has to move on from the hodl to deflate model.

(!)\n\nR: Are you familiar with the concept of Multi signature scripts?\n\nG: certainly.\n\nR: So imagine I send BTC to an address which can only be spend via two signatures and you hold a private key and I hold one. Who ones those bitcoin?\n\nG: that is a tricky one.\n\nR: Yes but - oh have you used a hardware wallet before?\n\nG: yes.\n\nR: So I assume you do understand the concept of a presigned transaction. Imagine we have a presigned transaction that sepends from the multisig sending some btc to you and some to me, then we would have decided ownership. \n\nG: Makes sense but why doing that?\n\nR: Well we don't broadcast the presigned transaction. instead we negotiate a new one while invalidating the old one using the bitcoin scripting language which allows us to transfer value.\n\nG: This is more private (!) than using bitcoin \\[At this moment I Rene Pickhardt am almost speechless\\]. That sounds interesting. \n\nR: Exactly! It can do more! Imagine you have a similar setup with Magnus \\[Carlsen\\] and I wanted to send him some money / Bitcoin. I could offer to you an output in our presigned transaction that you could claim if you know a secrete within some time. You could do the same with magnus who will reveal the secret as he wants to be paid. Of course Magnus might be able to forward the Payment. \n\nG: This sounds very useful. I will read about the details on the plane home.",
