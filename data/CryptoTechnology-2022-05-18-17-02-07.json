There is nothing special about 5G that calls for a crypto currency, and there is no such thing as a crypto currency that works well for 5G. \n\nCrypto and 5G are just protocols and if either of them are of high quality it will be independent of the other - there is zero reason I can think of why you would ever design one around the other. Maybe a high throughout blockchain could take advantage of 5G, but if that were the case they would be advertising the phenomenal speeds and not 5G. \n\nI\u2019m almost certain you are caught up in some fear of missing out by a gang of buzzword grifters. The value proposition hear sounds extremely dubious and I would recommend you do a lot more research before putting your hard earned into crypto related assets. Start with Bitcoin, it\u2019s proven safe and the best way to understand other projects (which, btw, are mostly scams).",

Think about how slow blockchains are for a transaction vs a normal communication on a 5G network? Why would I want my SMS to take 15 minutes and cost a fluctuating value between $0.00003 and $300 USD? We literally had a system like that 20 years ago. And then when some unrelated coin drops 50% mine can lose value too? \n\nJust do yourself a favor and give your money to a financial professional so that you will have something left in a few years.

The two pieces of technology are independent of eachother. \n\nThink of a car maker and a tire maker. We need each to have a fully functioning car. But no car only works with one tire manufacturer. Just as no tire manufacturer only works with one car company. There are standards for cars and there are standards for tires. There is a compatibility list. But no monopoly.\n\nDouble check that made sense by thinking about the production of screws and screwdrivers. \n\nCrypto and 5g are governed by the same type of standards. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model",
