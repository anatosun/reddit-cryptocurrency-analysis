And so when Do Kwon replaces luna with the other thing, Coinbase gets to keep the customer's money from the promise and also gets all the value of those shares credited to itself.\n\nSend the info up the hierarchy to the oligarchs asap.  This is Merrill/Citadel/Blackrock/Citi level wall street professional crime.  Coinbase is adopting, pumping, ponzie cryptos at unrealistic highs, and then shorting them by wrapping them, which keeps all the value in them when the ponzie blows out.  Once the feds figure this out (it's complex, few people if any fully understand it), they're going to make what Coinbase is doing a Crime.  Though it may take another 5 or 15 years to land on the books and it'll be a carnival shit show like robinhood was for freezing only one side of the market, so they can load or unload for a quick billion in profit.\n\nCoinbase evolved the ability to short sell scam cryptos like Citadel.  Find a tulip bulp ponzie at crazy highs, endorse it, pump it, receive money for promise to buy back later, short sell it deep out of the money, then eject it and pocket the difference.  Hats off I guess.  Scratch that don't tell SEC/Congress they're party to the crime.  Inform Citadel tell them they got competition muscling in on their divine right to create money.\n\nFurther business with this Scam company will be rocky over the next 5 or 10 years.  Professional Robbers hate competition.",

That's enough gas for about 7 more years of this daily irritation.

It's how the immune system works.  To make them go away, they either have to be cut in on the action, or paid to go away.  Failure for either, is fewer customers to defraud.",
