Sent the request for photo ID and a phot of myself and got an email stating my account should be available in 24 hours. \n\nAt exactly the 24 hour point, I received an email to reactivate my account.  I had to reset my password and I regained full access to my account except for a 24 hour hold on crypto sends.  I was still able to submit trades and I was able to move funds to my linked bank account. \n\nStill not sure what exactly happened, but not the doomsday scenario I\u2019ve read about from some others.  Had there been more market volatility, I probably would\u2019ve been more upset having missed out on some trading opportunities, but everything seems fine in the end.\n\nRegardless, some clarity on the email itself would\u2019ve been nice as well as better communication from the support staff.  \n\nTo be fair, though, I had a similar experience with a checking account I have around six months ago where they locked my entire account because they wanted to make sure a check I deposited would clear.  In that case, though, I was able to call back again and get the account unlocked by another customer service person .  \n\nPerhaps, as someone else suggested, I just happened to get support staff that wasn\u2019t sure exactly how to handle the situation and just figured this would eventually fix it.\n\nOne final note, I\u2019ve been a Coinbase customer almost since they first opened and have had to contact them a few times in the past.  None of the experiences were particularly satisfying, but also were resolved without too much trouble.  By comparison, I had to contact crypto.com recently about an issue through their in app support and that experience was far and away better than Coinbase.  Hopefully these exchanges will take note that there is a good amount of competition out there now a days and work to improve the support experience overall.",

There wasn\u2019t any other way that I could find to verify ID since it show d I had already verified in the app and on the web site.  \n\nNote that if you call them to do the reset, you won\u2019t be able to access your account for at least a day and then there will be a hold on your account for at least another day or two after you verify and reactivate.  So if you go that route, make sure you\u2019ve moved any coins and/or funds you will need within a week off the platform before you try to get it resolved through customer support. \n\nIt\u2019s also possible that you may not even need to do this at all.  I never got a clear answer from support on that.  They just reset my account so I could through the ID verification process.",
