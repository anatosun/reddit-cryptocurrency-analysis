            "selftext": "Have you noticed how many people are concerned after the recent crypto drops, and I was puzzled as to why some people sold their Ethereum or Bitcoin? There are various reasons why this is a bad idea. How are you managing the issue as a whole?  \n\n\nI must admit that were actually several points where I considered quitting, especially when I learned I'd have all these troubles with high gas prices and sluggish transactions, which were so unpleasant at the start, I felt helpless, and I even considered spending more money on gas fees than on purchasing more Ethereum haha.  \n\n\nHow did you feel when you first dealt with this issue?  \n\n\nHowever, I didn't know anyone who was working with Ethereum at the time, so I couldn't get any solid advice, I was on my own. Thanks to several Reddit users who helped me a lot by introducing me to L2 platforms, I now use Metis and I must say that these L2 solutions are essential for dealing with gas expenses.  \n\n\nThis is why I'm writing this since most of the individuals who started selling Ethereum and are afraid of losing everything are probably new here. All of this will not continue. Shortly, we will have a merge, and things will be a lot smoother. When it comes to cryptocurrency investment, time and patience are everything.  \n\n\nGuys, keep in mind that we're talking about the second-largest crypto, that the majority of stablecoins are placed on Ethereum's blockchain, that Ethereum has the most developers working on its blockchain, and that Ethereum leads the NFT market, dApps, DAOs, and so on. So there's no reason to be concerned.  \n\n\nSo, veterans do you have any tips for newbies?",

Nothing wrong with this strategy.\n\nBut I can't ignore the big picture, that's why I decided to swap 20% of my holdings to USDC and set limit orders all the way down to $24k and $1,400. This works as a hedge against the slow bleeding. Yes, in case of a huge pump I miss the gains for these 20%.\nBut I'm ok with this deal.",
