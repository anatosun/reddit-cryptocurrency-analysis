We cannot know when it's going to change direction, or how far it will fall.  Be we do have some timing information on Ethereum.  The first merge of a public testnet happens around June 8th.  If that is successful the price of ether will go up relative to the market.  Conversely, if that merge fails, Eth will lose relative value.  Everything might be falling, so any investment might lose.  I believe the merge will be successful.  I bet on Eth relative to the rest of the market.  DCA is safer, but knowing and using Eth development timing is something that shouldn't be ignored.\n\nEdit:  Warren Buffet doesn't suggest timing the market, but he is fond of saying to do the opposite when there is a big change.  When everyone is greedy, be fearful.  When everyone is fearful, be greedy.",
