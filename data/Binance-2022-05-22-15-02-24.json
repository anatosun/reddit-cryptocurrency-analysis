            "selftext": "I am still shocked by the email I received today from Binance. An email promoting pizzas. It is scandalous! It is well known, since many years, that pizzas are made of mozzarella. But there are only two mozzarellas: either the fake mozzarellas which are made, by the mafia, from garbage, sometimes rotten, recycled and bleached cheeses. Or the real mozzarella produced from the milk of animals that graze on contaminated meadows that serve as dumping grounds for the mafia's waste traffic in the Parma area.\n\nIn the face of this relentless promotion of mafia-related products, the question arises: is Binance in the hands of the mafia?\n\n[https://www.lemonde.fr/televisions-radio/article/2015/05/30/quand-mozzarella-rime-avec-mafia\\_4643908\\_1655027.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/televisions-radio/article/2015/05/30/quand-mozzarella-rime-avec-mafia_4643908_1655027.html)\n\n[https://www.liberation.fr/futurs/2008/03/26/la-mozzarella-victime-de-la-crise-des-dechets-a-naples\\_22454/](https://www.liberation.fr/futurs/2008/03/26/la-mozzarella-victime-de-la-crise-des-dechets-a-naples_22454/)\n\n[https://www.courrierinternational.com/article/enquete-pour-la-mafia-italienne-la-mozzarella-est-plus-rentable-que-la-cocaine](https://www.courrierinternational.com/article/enquete-pour-la-mafia-italienne-la-mozzarella-est-plus-rentable-que-la-cocaine)\n\n[https://www.rtbf.be/article/du-fromage-avarie-etait-recycle-pour-etre-integre-a-des-nouveaux-produits-5233253](https://www.rtbf.be/article/du-fromage-avarie-etait-recycle-pour-etre-integre-a-des-nouveaux-produits-5233253)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: I just realized that Today it was exactly 30 years ago that Judge Falcone was murdered. And this is exactly the day that Binance chose to send an email about pizza",
