It's early though, so it has a cap of $100k USD. Testing, testing, testing. Security is the name of the game.\n\n- StarkNet full node #2 - Juno is now live and has successfully synced up to block #94. Early days, but this is now the second full node implementation!\n\n- StarkSwap x iearnfinance collab - yep. They're collaborating on a DeFi pooling system where you can access L1 dApps from L2 with the cost of an L2 interaction by pooling many user transactions together!\n\n- http://cartridge.gg gaming wallet - improved UX for StarkNet games.\n\n- MatchboxDAO grants program announced - if you're looking to dive into Cairo and want to build a game or game component, this one's for you.\n\n- updates, updates, updates. So many libraries being released every single week. Someone implemented CRISP from the Paradigm paper.\n\n- fun fact: The Otherside mint on StarkEx would have cost only 0.25ETH under ideal conditions. Really makes you think, huh?\n\nMake sure to check out the full post linked above. Thanks for reading, ignore the charts for a while and I'll see you guys again next week!",
