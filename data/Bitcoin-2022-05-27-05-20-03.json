It's down 60%-70% right now and I'm spending all my spare cash on buying more bitcoin so the only way it'll break even is if the price hits previous highs again (unlikely? Probably, it's one of those staking tokens).\n\nThat said, I don't really want to convert it to bitcoin either because I keep thinking \"aw man I'm writing off a lot of money by trading it away!\" but since bitcoin will likely keep getting bigger against alts, that 60% loss might end up working out better if I just put the remaining 40% of value in bitcoin right now when it's cheap... Ugh. I think this has been the lesson they say every newbie goes through by wasting money on shitcoins at first.",

I prefer my odds in that scenario - much more than relying on democracy to prevent corruption and authoritarianism from taking hold of the 'legitimate' levers of power.\n\nDecentralization has its costs, but IMO it's as important with firearms as it is with Bitcoin.
