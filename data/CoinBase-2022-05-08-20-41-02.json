            "selftext": "This is not a fluke. It has happened multiple times in the past month.  As of writing, $ALGO is up 5.37%, yet Coinbase lists the \"Top Mover\" as some random coin called $SUKU at 2.25%. Earlier today, $ALGO was up even higher, way more than others were either up or down. Yesterday was the same. Last week when the $ALGO deal with FIFA was announced, it was up 13% while others were down, and the percentages for the top movers (both up and down) were in the low single digits. I recall a similar instance back in February where $ALGO pumped hard against the market, yet, despite clearly having the highest movement against tradable coins on Coinbase, it was nowhere to be found in the Top Movers list.\n\nI don't trade or make decisions based on the Top Mover list, nor do I think anyone else should. But, I find it deeply concerning that Coinbase seems to be putting their fingers on the scales here. I have many gripes with Coinbase that are even more concerning (\\*ahem\\* apparent insider trading on coins that are about to be listed \\*ahem\\*), but this is also another one.\n\nBut, seriously Coinbase, how is it that the top moving tradable coin doesn't actually show up as a Top Mover? Are you bad at maths and don't realize 13% > 4%? Is your algorithm busted? Or are you, unbeknownst to your customers, trying to pick winners and losers and move the market to your benefit?",
