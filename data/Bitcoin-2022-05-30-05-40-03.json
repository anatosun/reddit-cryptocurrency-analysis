We understand the goal of providing a new global monetary system, open to all. The scope of the project and its ramifications are even more momentous than the pyramid. Instead of stone, we have code and consensus. We build in cyberspace rather than the physical world. Our monument is everywhere and nowhere, bringing unique protections but also different kinds of vulnerabilities for which we must be vigilant and shore up where possible. The engineering design is simultaneously incredibly open (anyone can contribute to the code) and incredibly private (nobody can force a change onto anyone else). This deliberately messy and entirely voluntary system both supports and demands a social layer on top to coordinate any global-scale changes moving away from the status quo. If the inner functionality is to survive the harsh trials sure to come, we must orient both the code layer and the social layer for unprecedented resilience. Anything else risks failure.\u201d",

Make a function so you can seed a world with individual agents, specifying a ratio of different behaviors (for example agents that DCA Bitcoin, agents that buy bear markets, agents that fomo tops).\n\nYou can then set up different tax structures, build worlds where Bitcoin is either a store of value asset or one where it\u2019s a Bitcoin Standard with no other fiats. You can define countries with different tax laws and ways in which they treat Bitcoin to see how they fair economically against each other.\n\nOne of the main ideas I want to explore involves debunking the notion that you can\u2019t fuel technological growth without inflationary money and without requiring altruistic agents\u2013even at the multiple nation state level.",
