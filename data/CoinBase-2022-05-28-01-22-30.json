Or send it to an exchange that is still allowing trading (Kucoin for example), sell it for USDT and send that back to your Coinbase account to cash out. In either case you have to send it some place you can trade it. It\u2019s up to you on which is best. I use Kucoin so I would probably go that route.  Good luck.",
