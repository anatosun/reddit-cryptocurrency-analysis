In 5 days I've make approx 400$ in profit with  5K investment , wich I think is not bad , Of course i've missed the lowest to buy and highest to sell because of panic , but still I think its quite a good begining ?\n\nDo you guys have any tips to continue growing exponentially each day ?\n\nToday just seem hard because ive never seen such rollercoaster xD\n\nAlso with platform is the best for lowest fee ? im using kraken right now but its quite expensive \n\nThanks and best regards to you all\n\nApologize my english is not native",

Even experts fail to consistently predict fluctuations.

It isn\u2019t fast money, but it will save you losses and peace of mind.",
