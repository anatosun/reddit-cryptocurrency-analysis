Stop wishing and hoping and wanting. If you have the conviction like we all do here, then Do It. Start small and be consistent. But if you\u2019re still unsure and feeling iffy then don\u2019t, coz you\u2019ll only sell at the worst moment. Buy hold and forget about it and don\u2019t get freaked out. Good luck",
