This is deep wizard math that allows you to prove something occurred without proving anything else. \n\nIn Monero\u2019s case (there\u2019s a few ZK coins out there)\u2026\n-\tthe sender of a tx can see both addresses, the value of XMR transferred, and the timestamp\n-\tthe recipient of a tx can see their own address, XMR value, and timestamp but not the sender\u2019s address\n-\tanyone else not involved in the tx can *only* see the timestamp. They don\u2019t know who transferred how much to who, only that a transfer did indeed occur at a given time. \n\nSo likely what a person seeking absolute anonymity of funds would do is process the asset through a mixer like Tornado Cash, trade this asset on a non-KYC DEX for Monero XMR, transfer said Monero to another Monero wallet, then return to the DEX, repurchase the initial desired asset, and finally put that too through a mixer.\n\nFor extra security, do this all through a VPN and the Tor browser.",
