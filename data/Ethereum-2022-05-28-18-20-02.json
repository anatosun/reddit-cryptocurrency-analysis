Yeah, agreed. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve used this bridge before you but what basically happens is that the ETH HAS to be burned on Polygon before it gets released and you\u2019re capable of withdrawing it on the mainnet.\n\nYou basically just panicked over nothing pal. Next time all you have to do is go to [bridge-explorer.polygon.technology](https://bridge-explorer.polygon.technology) and just press the confirm exit button. It's that simple.\n\nSome are pointing out that his post was just FUD but I think its just a genuine mistake honestly. I\u2019m a big Polygon supporter but I still think it\u2019s good that we see posts like these from time to time so that more people can get educated about this.",
