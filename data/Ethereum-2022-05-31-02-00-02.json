            "selftext": "Hello Ethereum reddit!  I have small amount of funds that I would like to stake.  My question is: what would be the best place to stake ETH taking gas fees and Coinbase\u2019s current promotion into consideration.  \n\nPlease understand:\n\n(1)I have no plans to sell the holdings at any point, only add funds\n(2) Security and peace of mind are a priority of high yield\n\nI have never sent ETH off exchange and I do not hold any ETH yet, so I am not familiar with how much gas fees actually are and don\u2019t know how much to expect to pay in gas.  To my understanding, and please forgive my lack of understanding, there is a base gwei amount required for each transfer.  My two current considerations:\n\n(1) stake ETH from cold storage (Rocketpool or LIDO), but to first consider whether the gas fees would outweigh the benefits of funding smaller amounts of USD on a recurring basis.  \n\nMy other option is to utilize Coinbase\u2019s promotion (up to $50 free when staking up to $500 ETH).  With this method, I would not have funds on my own wallet, but I would avoid the gas fees and earn 3.75% APR.  The inability to access my ETH once deposited is not a concern.\n\nI am considering taking advantage of the $50 promo then weighing the cost-benefit of staking smaller amounts on a recurring basis thereafter.  \n\nI have so much to learn from this community and experience.  Thank you in advance for your time and insight.",

But will those staking pools refund you if they suffer a hack? Gas is cheap at the moment. A couple bucks a transaction. If your sending $500+ obviously that won\u2019t hurt to bad. I know you said you won\u2019t sell but keep in mind funds are locked and even after merge comes eth cannot be unstaked for like 6 months after consensus layer becomes live. Even if price nukes it\u2019s there for better or for worst.",

Also online you have to make sure you are loading in the 100% correct link.

Sending money off exchange for the first time can be nerve wracking it goes from clicking buy eth to send to this contract address and make sure you are on the correct chain when doing so.",

I\u2019ll give Kraken some credit though because they\u2019ve announced plans to go public.  \n\nThanks for your input.  If the decision is to stick with exchange staking, then I can see myself using Kraken or at least using it after taking advantage of the CB promo ($50 free, why not).",
