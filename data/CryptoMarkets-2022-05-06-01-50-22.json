People get suckered in so they start investing tons of money again and then the big boys dump on them.\n\nYou also have the Central Bankers talking about rising the interest rates to combat inflation so less people will be borrowing money which means the markets will go down more as there is less money coming in.\n\nOn the bright side, in 2024, Bitcoin will see another halving so we will most definitely get nice pumps, just like from 2020 to late 2021.",

It seems like there is for sure a plus tax break on income up to 3k - assuming markets don't bounce back and I don't have more capital gains to write off by year-end, plus an opportunity to consolidate to core projects.\n\nAny thoughts are greatly appreciated :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nexample of a wash sale and leveraging a loss against capital gains and income for clarity:\n\nI bought 1 BTC for 64k at the ATH, and now I want to sell that 1 BTC at 35K for a loss of 29k, but then take that money and immediately buy back the 1 BTC for 35K for a net loss of 0 BTC, but a capital loss of $29k against this tax season.\n\nThat 29K loss can then be deducted for any capital gains to reduce overall tax liability, but if all capital gains are balanced to 0 then you can take a max of 3k against normal income before rolling the capital loss into the next tax season.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso forgot to add, this is in the US from a tax perspective.",

I like what I have, minus maybe 10% that could be sold and redistributed to projects I like during my buy back.\n\nI guess i am wondering if it's crazy to sell at a loss and immediately buy bake to reset my cost basis on my portfolio and harvest a theoretically loss for tax purposes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIE: I bought 1 BTC for 64k at the ATH, and now I want to sell that 1 BTC at 35K for a loss of 29k, but then take that money and immediately buy back the 1 BTC for 35K for a net loss of 0 BTC, but a capital loss of $29k against this tax season.\n\nThat 29K loss can then be deducted for any capital gains to reduce overall tax liability, but if all capital gains are balanced to 0 then you can take a max of 3k against normal income before rolling the capital loss into the next tax season.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do think that it does make sense to take the money from the projects I don't want anymore and keep it in a stable coin so I can DCA over the rest of the year into the projects I do like. That however is a much lesser part of the question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is for the US by the way, forgot to add that.",
