People get suckered in so they start investing tons of money again and then the big boys dump on them.\n\nYou also have the Central Bankers talking about rising the interest rates to combat inflation so less people will be borrowing money which means the markets will go down more as there is less money coming in.\n\nOn the bright side, in 2024, Bitcoin will see another halving so we will most definitely get nice pumps, just like from 2020 to late 2021.",

It seems like there is for sure a plus tax break on income up to 3k - assuming markets don't bounce back and I don't have more capital gains to write off by year-end, plus an opportunity to consolidate to core projects.\n\nAny thoughts are greatly appreciated :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nexample of a wash sale and leveraging a loss against capital gains and income for clarity:\n\nI bought 1 BTC for 64k at the ATH, and now I want to sell that 1 BTC at 35K for a loss of 29k, but then take that money and immediately buy back the 1 BTC for 35K for a net loss of 0 BTC, but a capital loss of $29k against this tax season.\n\nThat 29K loss can then be deducted for any capital gains to reduce overall tax liability, but if all capital gains are balanced to 0 then you can take a max of 3k against normal income before rolling the capital loss into the next tax season.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nSeems like there is a lot of confusion around what I am asking. I am not planning on selling my portfolio and walking away with the loss. No need to respond \"just hodl\" or DCA those are givens. This question is specific to the pros and cons of a wash sale for tax purposes.\n\nSome tidbits I found through his exploration:\n\n\"As of December 2021, there is no crypto wash sale rule in place\u2013yet. The IRS officially considers digital currency to be property rather than a security.\"\n\n\"Yes, it\u2019s possible that cryptocurrency could eventually become subject to wash sale rules.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile, the Build Back Better Act includes a proposal to subject cryptocurrencies to the wash sale rule. If the Act were to become law, cryptocurrencies would be subject to the same treatment as stocks, mutual funds and other securities when applying the wash sale rule. That means cryptocurrency investors could face new tax liabilities when selling crypto at a loss and buying new crypto assets.\"\n\n[https://smartasset.com/investing/crypto-wash-sale#:\\~:text=Specifically%2C%20the%20wash%20sale%20rule,before%20or%20after%20the%20sale](https://smartasset.com/investing/crypto-wash-sale#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20the%20wash%20sale%20rule,before%20or%20after%20the%20sale).

These thoughts you are getting are mostly terrible lol\n\nI don't think there is any downside other than what you already mentioned ie fees and time. \n\nDo a thought exercise, pretend you had sold it all. What would you buy back? How would you reorganize your portfolio ideally? Then just rebalance to hit those %.  That will minimize your fees.  \n\nPersonally I've found that once I've sold things (with the intention to buy it back) that I realized I didn't actually want it enough to buy it back, so I didn't and reinvested elsewhere.

That however is a much lesser part of the question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is for the US by the way, forgot to add that.",
