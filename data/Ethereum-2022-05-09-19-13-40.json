            "selftext": "Curious what exactly EVM entails? For instance, if an L1 wants to build towards an EVM, are they doing it in solidity? What if it\u2019s a purpose specific chain say for instance, gaming and NFTs like Ronin/Flow? If someone were to launch a native token off that EVM chain - but with their own token standard (so not ERC20) how does that work? What about custom consensus mechanisms? \n\nDoes EVM essentially mean:\n1. Build own chain with custom scalability, consensus, etc\n2. \u201cTurn on\u201d EVM - where developers of Ethereum apps like Curve and ENS, etc can import those apps onto this custom chain? \n3. Equals = Reap the rewards of Ethereum apps but on a faster, custom built chain? \n\nI\u2019m gonna need the ELI5 because I\u2019m not a dev but curious about this topic as Ethereum is labeled \u201cthe world computer\u201d \n\nThanks!

But the recent development & activity has made crypto natives more bullish on the ecosystem than ever before.\n\n1. **Stripe X Polygon**  \nStripe, the global payments giant, is making its foray into the cryptoverse with Polygon. Soon, Stripe will allow business owners to pay using USDC. Plus, Twitter will be the first to use this! Imagine the possibilities...\n2. **Underpinning blockchain in Lugano**  \nLugano is a pro-crypto city based in Switzerland and has decided to settle its stablecoin (USDT & LVGA) transactions on Polygon Thanks to its low fees The crypto-friendly Swiss town recently made Bitcoin and crypto legal tender.\n3. **Investors\u2764\ufe0fPolygon**  \nPolygon has been massively funded In Feb, Polygon raised $450M in funding led by Asia\u2019s biggest crypto investing firm Sequoia Capital with participation from leading global investors including: Animoca, Seven Seven Six & Kevin O\u2019Leary aka Mr. Wonderful.\n4. **Redpilling Web2.0 companies**  \nPolygon is onboarding Web2.0 based companies into the decentralized world of Web3.0. Draft Kings, a NASDAQ-listed sports betting company, has partnered with Polygon & has announced setting up a validator\u2019s node to help decentralize its PoS network.\n5. **Frontrunning P2E gaming**  \nPolygon Studios, the gaming/Metaverse arm of Polygon, is working at the forefront to bring GameFi & Metaverse to the masses. Guess who\u2019s heading it? Ryan Wyatts\u2014 Ex-head of gaming at Youtube to build out the gaming division at Polygon.\n6. **Supernet chains**  \nPolygon has several other scaling solutions besides its famed & widely used PoS chain. One of them is Supernet Chains. These are a set of highly scalable interconnected chains allowing devs to build their projects in customizable environments with 0 costs. To incentivize devs to build on these Supernet Chains, the foundation has announced a $100M support fund.\n7. **Hermez 2.0, NightFall, Avail, Miden, Zero (Plonky 2.0) - Launching Live / TestNet**  \nThe Polygon team will be launching Hermez 2.0 & NightFall to the livenet later this year. And Avail, Miden, and Zero chains will be hitting TestNet before the end of the year. These coupled with the Ethereum merge (expected in the Fall) will drive huge adoption. Also, don't forget an Enterprise chain is also in the works.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q6aggc5cnwx81.jpg?width=1820&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e587a296444c0612d4e032e0dd22f119b8a29eb",

That's why it doesn't. \n\nWhat it does is solving some vulnerabilities and reducing unnecessary issuance costs, as staking costs are way lesser than mining costs. Keeping the same token issuance would have been an additional feature of drastically increasing security, way beyond what's currently accepted. It would have needed strong proofs that it was needed. \n\nAmong the vulnerabilities that are solved: \n\n* increased beyond profitability level the cost of manipulating gas price with transaction spam, thanks to gas being burnt; \n\n* increased censorship resistance by switching from PoW to PoS, as such allowing any consensus actor to be as anonymous as they desire to avoid any risk of coercion from anyone else; \n\n* solved the 51% vulnerability of PoW through layer 0 consensus adoption. \n\nThe fact ETH is most probably becoming *temporarily* deflationary as a result is only coincidental.\n\nTo be noted that, if ETH price increases without any increase in gas demand, we may just as well end up with a temporarily inflationary currency, because that's what the network self-regulation entails.",

If the inflation rate of a cryptoasset is higher, there is less incentive to save it, leading to a more active supply. If you want to incentivize transactions, then you need to increase the issuance rate to disincentivize absolute saving of coins.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.\n\n**When is Eth2 launching?**\n\nEth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. \"The Merge\", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.\n\nVisit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about \"The Merge\".\n\n**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**\n\nNo, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.\n\n**How can I stake my ETH?**\n\nThere are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.\n\n* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details\n* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)\n\n**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**\n\nLike most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.\n\n**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**\n\nEthereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.\n\nAdditionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.\n\nWhile rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.\n\n**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**\n\nThe most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre there questions you'd like to see added? Leave a comment below.",
