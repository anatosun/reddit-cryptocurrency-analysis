They were stealing electricity consmption 2000euros per month, but they will get punished with maximum fine of 12 months, so 24000 euros. Fortunately for them, they won't be charged with drugs related things... The miners mostly 21 rigs were valued in 50.000\u20ac. No information about how much they mine but police says they were caught at an \"early stage\" and they mined 2500\u20ac per month so 500\u20ac profit per month \"therorically\". Energy in Spain is really expensive and it's almost not \"doable\" mining in Spain if you do not steal or have \"free energy\"",

For instance Codeine is turned into morphine in the liver but only at a roughly 10 to 1 rate, so 100 mg codeine is effectively 10 mg morphine, while 100 mg heroin would roughly translate to 150 mg morphine metabolized due to higher absorbtion rate and some other factors.",

If this is Venezuela for example, the goverment actively seizes crypto mining operations that don't have a \"permit\" (it's all corrupt). Venezuela is so corrupt and dangerous that who's going to ask for a permit to mine crypto in Venezuela? That's literally putting a target in your back.\n\nAnyways in Venezuela they sieze the machines and put them to mine crypto for themselves. The Venezuelan government has a many huge mining operations most of them running with confiscated machines, and who knows where those crypto are going. Certainly not to Venezuela's coffers. Some the people in power that control the government are probably among the top crypto whales as they've been doing the for years. \n\nYou know the $5 wrench attack? Now imagine the the government of the country you live in is the one doing the attack.",
