            "selftext": "Hello Dogecoin Reddit Community, \n\nMy name is David Mitchell Jr. This is going to be a long post but, I believe it's crucial for the health of the community. I don't have the largest platform on YT so I'm writing articles now to inform everyone this is about more than holding.  If you take a close look at the charts you'll see the strategic effort to control Dogecoin's price. Most of you may know that Dogecoin's price action has been extremely manipulated however, a lot of you may not know-how. I've been publishing my research in video form if you want to see charts but the fact is the exchanges are using our coins against us. It's become so obvious that even Gary Gensler is speaking on it. \n\nInstitutions hold about 82% of all coins on their exchanges... which is roughly 110 Billion of the 135 Billion supply. I've been doing my best to inform the community to switch to a cold wallet to restrict access. Why? \n\nExchanges are no different than banks... it's really of no benefit to them to hold your crypto if they can't use it to make money. This is where shorting comes in. An abnormal amount of shorts are present in Dogecoin. I've seen rallies of +200% on nothing but an Elon Tweet. Institutions will lend your Dogecoin to be shorted against the current demand. Yes, your crypto in a way is duplicated and used to place an immediate sell order in the market. They charge a fee for this of course, in addition, to making money on the buy/sell. \n\nFYI (Side Note): A short is a borrowed asset that is immediately sold into the market. The shorter is a guaranteed buyer at some point but the effort is to drive the price down and buy at a lower price. The gap between the borrowed sale order and the purchase price at the (hopefully) lower price is the spread. If the price increases then they will have to buy it for a higher price and thus take a loss. If the asset has become scarce, or over-leveraged this can result in a squeeze...creating an abnormal amount of buying pressure for any of the assets that hit the market, sending the price parabolic. \n\nThe crazy part about all of this is, that Dogecoin shorts always engage at the beginning of a catalyst or news. This is why I believe it's about more than money. It makes much more sense to wait for the curve and open up the gap between your sell order and a natural correction...if you're shorting for profit. The actions I'm seeing seem to be more personal. It's to curve momentum and suppress the price. \n\nWe know that Dogecoin is the most held crypto and roughly 60% of all wallets contain some Dogecoin. So, this information along with the charts allows me to believe the price action of Dogecoin has been vastly off for some time. You can find evidence of this right now by looking at the pool of liquidity surrounding Doge and the fact they can't exit their short position completely anymore, otherwise, Doge would either rally or appear as a hedge to what's going on in the market. The community did have a sell-off but not as bad as it looks. \n\nIf we remove our coins from exchanges we will limit the access they have to our coins. You can do this via a cold wallet...like Nano\n\nFYI (Side Note) It\u2019s important to know that your crypto is not actually on the device. It\u2019s still on the blockchain. Your Nano will help you manage your seed phrase which will give you access to your coins. They're a lot of fake sites selling Nanos, so please make sure you get one from the actual site for your crypto. [https://shop.ledger.com/?r=01f1d3f5672a](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=01f1d3f5672a)\n\nWhen you remove the coins from the exchange this will reduce a dramatic portion of the lending. If the exchanges wish to lend coins make them go on the market and buy coins to lend them for shorts. \n\nSome of you may ask, doesn't 1 Doge = 1 Doge? That's a loaded question but the truth of the matter is the market is designed to provide leverage. When leverage is involved nothing is 1=1. The principle of a short creating a negative sell order of the same Dogecoin someone is holding is manipulation, to say the least. It's like synthetic Dogecoins are created but erased when the position is covered, all in the name to extract money. \n\nThe truth is even at 10k doge a minute we don't have enough Dogecoin to become the internet currency. The inflation argument doesn't make sense mathematically. 135 Billion Coins with at least 4 Million holders ( our current wallet addresses) leaves us with about 33,750 coins each or $2,700.  These numbers alone would leave 0 Doge available to buy. This alone suggests with any form of massive utility Dogecoin will appreciate greatly due to the lack of coins. Imagine 50 million people on Twitter with 100 Doge in their wallet. It's game over, you couldn't even short it. There would be no more coins left. \n\nA prime example of this is Binance refusing to show Proof of Assets for Dogecoin. Even though, they do so for Dogecoin. They also use a wrap-around token for trading...their BSC token. Supposedly is 1=1. We have no way of knowing this because we don't know how many Dogecoin they have. So it could be 1=3 for all we know. This is how all the BS starts. It always starts with abuse to leverage. \n\nI could write a book on Reddit but I know some of you will need charts to verify etc so here are some of the videos that include the charts and break down the math. If this is received well, I'll write more in the future. \n\nWhat Are Shorts: \n\n[https://youtu.be/sVVYPRy5ovo](https://youtu.be/sVVYPRy5ovo)\n\nWe Need More Dogecoin: \n\n[https://youtu.be/NUBFbSuQMlg](https://youtu.be/NUBFbSuQMlg)\n\nEven If They Got Doge To A Penny: \n\n[https://youtu.be/\\_HD8zp2nF58](https://youtu.be/_HD8zp2nF58)\n\nThe Binance/Exchange Fake Coins : \n\n[https://youtu.be/mbj-8XnjhCA](https://youtu.be/mbj-8XnjhCA)\n\nI hope this information finds you well, \n\nDavid",
