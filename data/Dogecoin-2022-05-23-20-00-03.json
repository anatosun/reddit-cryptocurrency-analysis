            "selftext": "The number 10 place on CoinMarketCap\u2019s list of the biggest cryptos by market cap, Dogecoin (DOGE), has seen a slight price gain in the last 24 hours according to the crypto market tracker. \n\n At the time of writing , the price of DOGE is around $0.08699, which is a 2.52% price increase compared to what it was 24 hours ago as tokens saw a bit of an upsurge yesterday with Luna gaining over 50%, Bobcoin seeing double figures in price increase percentage as well as FTM. \n\n  Despite that, the weekly performance of Dogecoin has seen it at a loss, however, as its price dropped 4.58% over the last 7 days. This has in any case seen DOGE strengthen against Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Currently, 1 DOGE is worth 0.0.000002876 BTC and 0.0000428 ETH. This means that DOGE has strengthened 0.31% against BTC and 0.24% against ETH. \n\n A descending triangle has formed on the 4 hour chart for DOGE/USDT, which is a bearish indicator. \nThis is because the price of DOGE has posted lower highs while bouncing from the $0.0845 level in the last 2 days but has surpassed it now. Should the price of DOGE break below the $0.0845 level again, we could see DOGE drop to as low as $0.075. Do you feel it will come back?",
