            "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI'm trying to finalize my coinbase profile here by adding my bank account to my account, and anytime I try to it fails, it tells me my credentials are invalid. What it's telling me is actually impossible due to me being able to log into my banks website & app with the same exact credentials I'm plugging into Plaid. I've tried 10+ times. I've even made sure to press each key for my password with 1 finger, and watching each finger press the correct key, JUST to be sure it wasn't user error. I ran into this problem before when trying to sign up on Webull, and it was never resolved. I contacted support and they just kept telling me to \"make sure my credentials were correct\" over and over again, even after trying to explain to them that the credentials I am using are 1000% correct. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas anybody else seen this issue before?",
