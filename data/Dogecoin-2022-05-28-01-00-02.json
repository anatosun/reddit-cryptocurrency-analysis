(Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) These companies have quite literally had the biggest influence on society, yet you prioritize on a singular man. \n\nIf you want more companies have you heard of FOX or CNN? Media companies that both sides are telling lies yet as well both sides are telling the truth. \nYou may even ask yourself how that\u2019s possible but that\u2019s because media companies are meant to deliver information and have the \u201cviewers\u201d back at home interpret what\u2019s real and what\u2019s fake. \n\nA rule of thumb I learned in the Real Estate investment world is that \u201cYou can either hate on the successful people, or you can join them.
