                    "response": "With the correlation between BTC and Nasdaq these days I decided to take a look at how the Nasdaq has recovered from down markets in the past.  The Nasdaq is down about 30% year-to-date.  I think it\u2019s pretty safe to assume it will be a negative year.\n\n\r  \nYou may be surprised to learn, as I was, that in the 50 year history of the Nasdaq there have only been consecutive down years on two occasions.  The first time was 1974 & 1975 (-31% & -35%).  The other time was after the dotcom bubble crash in 2000 which was immediately followed by 9/11.  In this case there was actually 3 consecutive down years. \n\nhttps://www.macrotrends.net/1320/nasdaq-historical-chart\n\n\r  \nInflation was also very high in \u201874/\u201975 (11% & 9%).  Although it would get even higher in the early 80s.\r  \n\n\nFor a number of reasons I don\u2019t think the current market is anything like the 2000 bust.\r  \n\r  \nThe last big down year was 2008 when the Nasdaq was down over 40%.  The next year it was up 43%.  Of course, a 40% gain doesn\u2019t erase a 40% lose.  It took about 4 years for the market to regain previous highs.\r  \n\r  \nAnother thing I found interesting was that the 2008 market topped out in November of the previous year (like this time around) and selloff bottomed out in February of 2009.   After that it went on a 65% run over the next 12 months.  If history repeated itself, we would see a bottoming in February of 2023.  That\u2019s about one year before the next bitcoin halving.  \n\nBut the current monetary environment is different today than in 2008-2009 so who knows.  None of the historical comparisons are perfect.  But just like with bitcoin it pays to zoom out and realize that markets never go down forever.",

If that is true, then the exchange never needs bitcoin to beck the trades, just cash equivalent. \n \nIf shorts profit, longs get liquidated and their money goes to the shorts and vice versa. When the two sides of the books a re balanced this is pretty risk free, but when you have an outsized long, if bitcoin explodes to the upside, the exchange will be on the hook for a lot of cash to pay them. This scenario is what will blow up exchanges who are fractionally using their bitcoin reserves. \n \nI have never once seen a screenshot or notification saying how many bitcoins are locked up in trades. I'm pretty sure if tou had the cash they would let you leverage into a 22MM bitcoin position.",

Bitcoin's price continues to grow at a very rapid rate, long term average. You see, there were good reasons for Bitcoin's rapid rise. Most of those reasons still exist. In fact, today there are even more good reasons than there were 10 or 5 years ago. It is reasonable to expect the long term average growth rate of Bitcoin to stay very high for the foreseeable future.\n\nReal estate has significant holding costs (eg: taxes, maintenance, insurance, sometimes fees, interest). Real estate isn't very liquid, and it has extremely high transaction costs.\n\nUltimately, the price of real estate (and rents) is limited by incomes. For example, in the long run people can't pay more for mort./rent than they earn. Realistically, they might be able to afford (at most) 35 or 40 percent of their net income for \"a place to live\". Thus, real estate prices are limited by incomes in the long run. Incomes tend to barely keep up with inflation.\n\nLooking at long term historical data, such as Case-Shiller, for popular real estate markets, we see, in fact, that real estate prices barely track the rate of inflation, especially when the significant holding costs are properly accounted for.\n\nBitcoin has no such limit. Bitcoin has no holding costs. Bitcoin is liquid. Bitcoin transactions are typically very little. Bitcoin's price has been more than doubling every year, long term average, and as mentioned before, can reasonably be expected to continues its rapid ascent.\n\nReal estate is currently in a bubble, as evidenced by the price-to-income ratios. The current bubble will pop, as the prior bubble eventually had to pop.\n\nReal estate is nailed down. Bitcoin can be taken with you to anywhere in the world. Real estate is a sitting duck for higher taxes. Real estate can be confiscated.\n\nWhen the private keys are properly stored, Bitcoin cannot be confiscated.\n\nKnowing all this, a person would be a total idiot to purchase real estate instead of investing in Bitcoin.\n\nHaving said that, I do plan on eventually using a small fraction (about 10 or 15 percent) of my Bitcoin holdings to buy my dream home - and to pay for it with Bitcoin, but still end up sitting on a serious stack of sats.\n\nI have zero regrets for investing in Bitcoin instead of real estate, and I never will.\n206",

Save your fiat for something you believe in.\n\nIf you don't question BTCs long term price trajectory and you do believe it will someday go beyond $69k then you have three options:\n\n1) Aggressively buy now. Worst case scenario is that we dip to 20k or lower before launching to the moon and you missed out on some extra gains\n\n2) Wait to see if it dips to $20k before buying. Worst case scenario is that it only goes up from here and the rocket departs without you.\n\n3) DCA every week. Worst case scenario is that it only goes up from here and your average buying price is much higher.\n\nNow lets consider the best and worst case scenarios when it hits 69k:\n\nOption 1) In the worst case you still more than doubled your money. Best case scenario is that you ONLY doubled your money.\n\nOption 2) Worst case is that you made zero money. Best case scenario is that you more than tripled your money.\n\nOption 3) Worst case is that you made decent returns on your money. Best case is that you took advantage of the dip but also lost potential money on the way up so you cancelled out the benefit of the dip.\n\nIn my opinion the logical choice is Option 1 since the worst case is that you still doubled your money.",
