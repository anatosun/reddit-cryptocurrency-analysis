Since I was reading the Fiat standard by Saifedean Ammous, I had the idea to pick a subject about fiat. I have to hand out a set of questions to 10 people, and it can be online so I would like to ask these questions here. Here is the link to the survey:  \n[https://taroku650.aidaform.com/expert-account-template-net-promoter-score-survey1](https://taroku650.aidaform.com/expert-account-template-net-promoter-score-survey1)  \n\n\nIf you have time I would appreciate if you can answer it. Thanks!",
