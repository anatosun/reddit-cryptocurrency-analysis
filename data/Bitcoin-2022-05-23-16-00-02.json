So while us common folks should buy the real thing, a spot ETF would be beneficial to businesses who don\u2019t want to go out of their way to purchase btc on an exchange, invest in hardware wallets etc, and would much rather an ETF that could be purchased through their typical investment brokerage",

I'd love to have more exposure to Crypto when looking at total asset allocation, however I really don't want to use a taxable account for such a highly volatile and frequently traded asset. \n\nI did some reading a while back on crypto IRA's but decided the fees were a bit excessive for my taste. I was recently introduced to the \"IRA/LLC\" or \"Checkbook IRA\" and have been doing a bit of research. Definitely DYOR and I'm not going to list any specific companies. \n\nTo be brief, it is a combination of a self-directed Roth/IRA which owns/invest in an LLC. The LLC is managed by you, and can purchase a variety of assets for the benefit of its owner/investor. There are some caveats to prevent the manager from billing the LLC and getting around the distribution limitations imposed by an IRA. The historical use has been for real estate property but it can be used for a variety of assets. \n\nI'm considering rolling over some Roth IRA funds to this type of account. It would allow for purchasing from a DEX, self-custody in a cold wallet, tax advantages, and significant legal protections. YMMV, and this is not financial advice.",

The SEC already laid out guidelines for what they required to approve a spot ETF and none of those things will be done by July so it\u2019s not like they are gonna magically change their mind. In case anyone was curious they want crypto exchanges to adopt comprehensive surveillance agreements and they want to see significant demand/liquidity for the product. I don\u2019t agree with all of this personally and feel they set the goal posts far away so they could keep manipulating futures over spot. I own Grayscale and I will probably regret it for a long time\u2026",

No, in fact something similar to the 2000-2002\n\nMost metrics , though, shows the Nasdaq to already be oversold. An oversold Nasdaq in the weekly has never lost 50%, and Bitcoin has never decoupled from the nasdaq so wildly for almost a decade now (so much as to bottom all all the while Nasdaq is recovering)...\n\nSo, yeah, some things we do know with at least some certainly. We are going to neither short term. If sth catastrophic happens to the protocol maybe we see bitcoin again as low further in the future. Equally if more of the traditional finance on boards to bitcoin we may see 100k in the next mania phase, whenever that may be. A $20k-$40k sounds like a realistic range for the short term in fact.",

It is equally foolish to pretend that we do not know that it will be somewhere around here even though bitcoin tends to bottom where the stock exchanges do.\n\nYou can't just ignore history and tell we know *nothing* of where the price will go next. No, actually we have a 10 year history giving us good clue that mostly hold true and ignoring it can lead to worse financial ruin than taking it in some consideration.\n\nWe.do.not.go to 8k unless a black swan happens (to bitcoin) or we immediately enter a long term recession. Mark these words, save them and return to them after some time.\n\nThis is not merely a prediction, it is a deduction produced by the past behaviors of bitcoin compared to world economies. It always does certain things (bottomm with the market, never go below the 200 wma and stay there, etc).\n\nEventually it will break some of those things. the vast majority of chances is that this won't be the time, and prolly buying at these prices is better (even if it briefly goes lower), than simply holding on and pretending that we can k ow nothing about the price...",

Literally 95% of holders would be underwater at that price, something we\u2019ve never even been close to.",

The trick is that bull markets strike fast and you really never know when they will come. It doesnt correlate well to news, to fed policy, or anything really. just sometimes the dollar price goes up by 2x to 20x, and its probably as much the dollar losing purchasing power as bitcoin gaining popularity. \n\nthe dollar is currently sitting at 3200 sats, and trending sideways.\n\nJust dont be exposed with custodial sats sitting on an exchange.",

The closer you get to 8K the more and more people see a \"full coin\" as affordable relative to the previous ATH. This would lead to an increasing amount of buying pressure the further it went down.\n\nSpeculation? Sure.\n\nBut I also set buys at Bitcoin after Mt. Gox at $275 and set more buys at $4200 and $3900 after it popped at 18K.\n\nSo I called the last two bottoms (and I don't actively trade, I only buy and hodl).\n\nThen again, I did not anticipate massive inflation and a global economic meltdown.\n\nEdit: Then again, I expected higher then 69K this time around. So..... Lol",
