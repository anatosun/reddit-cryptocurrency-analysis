However having the satellite itself ready is not trivial by any means, and before i see any real confirmation by the satellite company i wouldnt get my hopes up. Furthermore, the same company which already has one satellite scheduled for october 1st. It does not seem to be a company with resources to focus on many project at once. Also, in aerospace it's really really rare for things like this to be unexpected. Even the fastest and most reliable companies very often have at least one delay from the original date, and in this case it hasn't even been set so i don't think its realistic to expect a launch so soon.",

A lot of those satellites are still in development, a lot of those satellites are still in planning. Launches are scarce and companies buy them in  \n\n\nIm sorry but i wont be replying anymore, i saw you write some sensible stuff before so i know youre not a troll, but in this case youre just too proud to admit you were wrong, you stated clear ignorance of basic facts in the field and kept on going, you'll try to refute what i say and it will take precious minutes of my life to keep writing down and looking for links.

I remeber seeing official source for the rocket but ages ago cant find it now. The current official source for the satelite is this:  \n\n\n[https://www.geometricspace.ca/launch/schedule](https://www.geometricspace.ca/launch/schedule)  \n\n\nAnd it's TBD not third quarter or even guarantee of a year. Getting a satellite ready is not easy or trivial, that's why companies exist devoted solely to this. Furthermore they have another launch that's set to launch on october 1st. Since it's not a very big company its very likely they dont have the resources to focus on more than one project at once.FURTHERMORE its really rare for satellites and rockets to be launched perfectly on schedule, even by the quickest and most reliable companies, there's almost always at least a small delay (small could mean weeks or months). It's also really rare that projects these bigs are announced with little anticipation. Meaning, most of the tie the aproximate ready date is set at least a couple of months before, often 6 months or even years before. So to assume that the launch date will go from TDB (which is the offical state that no one has contended with believable information) to 28 june, and actually launch there with no delays, when even big satellite companies that are completely devoted to one project almost never achieve that level of quickness and reliability, and keeping in mind that were talking about a small satellite companies with other projects going on, is not zero but very close to it.\n\nThis is all based on hard evidence, a careful study of the world aerospace sector that ive been carrying on for years and the only official information that has been posted in this thread so far afaik.",
