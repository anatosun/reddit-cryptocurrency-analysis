            "selftext": "So I d like to know how Bitcoin supposedly saves us from all the ills of the current monetary system.\n\n  \nThere are a fixed supply of 21 million bitcoins and just a few million left. \n\nSo we got \\~19 million bitcoins already assigned to someone, let's say in the future through hyper-inflation, fiat is worth 0 and a bitcoin is holding massive purchasing power. That means that the current small percentage of bitcoin holders won the lottery and become the new 1% for doing what exactly, for being early? \n\nHow do you become the 1% today? By providing value to society, which rewards you with IOUs in the form of fiat. You think society (=government) will accept a situation where the 1% is a bunch of bitcoin holders having enormous wealth for no other reason than having bought in at the right time? There will be such a large part of society losing everything that they will elect a government that will outright redistribute or replace bitcoin. At the end, fiat money has credibility because society beliefs in all of its implications. The rich got rich because they create value and the middle class gets its fair share. \n\nIn what universe would society accept a wealth redistribution that radical as implied by this sub? I don't see it happen but honestly I am not trolling, If I m missing the bigger picture, please elaborate.\n\nBitcoin will be tolerated as long as it does not shift significantly wealth distribution.\n\nThe only places where bitcoin has replaced government fiat (officially or unofficially) is in countries with little to no democracy and quality of life. If bitcoin thrives, it means we have lost all confidence in our government (= in ourselves as a society) and we are well on the way to societal collapse.",

Salvation!\n\nEdit : in Bitcoin, the opportunity to build generational wealth from almost nothing as an individual - possible a decade ago, less so 5 years ago - is now arguably gone. Unless you are providing some sort of service or commercialisable innovation. There will be no major wealth redistribution, as institutionals and extremely high net worth individuals are already deeply vested. Critical mass has been reached, and uptake will continue. Bitcoin is decentralized and extremely government and regulation resistant.",

In a Bitcoin Standard, you are incentivised to spend your Bitcoin only on things that truly provide value....which not only redistributes BTC to others who provide value, it also incentivises us to have a lower time preference and seek to do things that provide value.\n\nThe system itself is decentralised. In the current system those who are closer to the money printer benefit, whilst those who dont have assets/can't buy assets are screwed. If I am in a 3rd world country, and hold Bitcoin that is proportionate to the wealth of the nation, I know my spending power cannot be destroyed by Governments.....I don't need to be the wealthiest. That starting point (your comment above) assumes the same goals in the current system are true for a Bitcoin Standard. It also assumes that everyone's goal is to become mega wealthy....some just want enough to live, and therefore if there are 1% of the world who hold a large portion of BTC...it doesn't take away from the benefits I receive from the system.\n\nYes some will have more, some will have less, but the key point is, all you need to do is keep saving BTC and your purchasing power doesn't get destroyed. It's not about having the world with each person holding the same amount, it's about having each person having the opportunity to not get poor slowly like in the current system.",

You will be initially more wealthy because you got in early, but a fool and his money are soon parted, so if you aren't good at investment or management it will go to those more deserving\n2. I thought all the billionaire entrepreneurs told us they would be billionaire entrepreneurs anyway, through hard work?  So they'll get the money back by taking loans to start their companies and making products, same as today.  No?  Surely you aren't telling me that many of them got extremely **lucky**?  Can't have it both ways.  Either you believe the bootstrap stories and therefore others having most of the cash temporarily isn't an issue, or you don't, so why are you afraid to have a similar gamble with those others?  If it's luck and not bootstrapping, this new crop of Bitcoin rich are equally likely to have inventors in their midst.\n3. Getting money from being early is quite literally what angel investing is.   You have a huge risk of the project going to 0 and losing everything (Bitcoin was and is not a guarantee).  No reason to complain about it.\n4. At this point if you get into Bitcoin, you're not \"early\" like a 2010-er, but you have 12 years of history to guide you.  If you don't get in, that's your fault.  If you get in now, you aren't late, you just aren't early.\n5. In your future, jobs pay in BTC.  So people who work, and provide a value to society, get BTC.  No one is locked out.\n\nThis sounds an awful lot like sour grapes thinking mixed with an unhealthy dose of class warfare.  The bottom line is most people think \"You have millions in USD?  Wow you must be a successful businessman\" yet \"You have thousands of BTC?  Nerd\".  Stop thinking that.  It's not correct for the USD case nor the BTC case and it leads to dumb thinking like \"The USD guy deserves his wealth, but the BTC guy got lucky\".\n\nNews flash - nobody did shit without getting lucky, and survivorship bias means you just don't hear about the millions of guys who lost their shirt starting a business, investing in a company or a crypto, etc.\n\nIf someone has a lot of wealth in any currency, who the fuck cares so long as they don't wield undue influence in government.  And if they do, **tackle that problem**.",

I say stop living in fear and letting the media spin this crazy narrative. Push back. Bitcoin is not perfect, but it is the best we can do to take back some power without a direct fight.\n\nI can't really elaborate on how Bitcoin gets its value better than others on this sub, but I do know it's mined with tons of energy. Ppl go out of their way to acquire the land, hardware, and electricity to compete for its block reward just like any land grab that brought today's civilization upon us. It's mathematically scarce, secure, immutable, etc. The list just goes on...\n\nWith Bitcoin I came for the wealth, but I stayed for rebellion. It's opened my eyes to so many facets of world history, computer science, economics, cryptography, and politics. If you think bitcoiners would easily give up their right to use it, you're dead wrong.\n\nSo yeah, bitcoin probably won't replace fiat, even tho it probably *should*",
