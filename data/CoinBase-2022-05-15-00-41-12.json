                            "response": "Well your support team is writing some random answers, not inline with my case. they talking something about SEPA-Transfers... i didnt even do any sepa transfer to coinbase and other withdrawals (USDT) went thru without any problem, just my BTC-withdrawals not working.  \n\n\nfor example last email - what is that for an answer? My funds are not even in the coinbase-wallet, they are on coinbase pro and i tried to send them away, i just bought the btc with usdt i got there:  \n\n\nHi \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*,\r  \n\r  \nThank you for contacting Coinbase Support. We appreciate your time and effort in bringing your concern to our attention about your BTC transactions and we'll be more happy to provide clarity in this matter.\r  \n\r  \nBased on our records, you have funds on hold indicated in your account and we can further explain why your funds are on hold.\r  \n\r  \nCoinbase Pro is a separate service offered by Coinbase. Your Coinbase and Pro accounts each have their own wallets for available digital assets and fiat.\r  \n\r  \nOnce a purchase or transfer has been made on Coinbase, we provide access to those funds in your Coinbase wallet immediately. \"Funds on Hold\" are funds recently deposited to Coinbase, but have not cleared between banks and have not been deposited into your Coinbase account.\r  \n\r  \nProviding the deposit immediately into your Coinbase wallet allows you to understand your total balance and trade at the price you want immediately on Coinbase, however those funds are placed on an initial hold before they can be transferred out of Coinbase. Once the hold clears, you will then have the ability to transfer the funds to Coinbase Pro, withdraw fiat to your bank, or send funds offsite.\r  \n\r  \nTo check the hold time on your funds:\r  \n\r  \n\\- Sign in to your Coinbase account, and visit your \"Portfolios page\":https://www.coinbase.com/accounts\r  \n\\- On the top left hand corner where your available balance is, Please select the Question Mark Icon, and in the pop up window there will be more details on when your hold will be cleared.\r  \n\r  \nPlease note: Until your pending funds clear between banks, you cannot withdraw them from Coinbase or transfer those funds to Pro. Once the hold clears, you will be able to transfer the funds to Pro.\r  \n\r  \nTo avoid holding on your funds going forward, I would recommend depositing directly into Coinbase Pro. To do this, please see instructions \"\"here.\"\":https://support.pro.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2936551-funding-your-account-with-usd?b\\_id=17474\r  \n\r  \nWe hope this information helps. If you are still running into issues after your hold time has elapsed, please let us know, and we'll be happy to assist you further.\r  \n\r  \nStay Safe!\r  \n\r  \nThanks,",
