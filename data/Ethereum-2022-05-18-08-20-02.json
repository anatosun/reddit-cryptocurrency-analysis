Be careful, because you're most probably getting scammed: an increase from 9 to 33, whatever the unit, isn't something that happened to Ethereum recently. \n\nBesides, you really should Do Your Own Research about whatever you're investing in and ask yourself why you're investing in the first place. Just asking around whether you should invest or not isn't DYOR at all. \n\nFor instance, let's say you invest now. What will you do if it drops to half its value? Sell? If so, you mean you're intending to buy high and sell low? Is that a sound strategy to you? \n\nRather, start asking yourself for how much time you're willing to invest and try to understand the products you're willing to invest in so as to know why it should have value rather than waiting for others to tell you that it's either the moon or over.",
