Then they release private chain. The nodes would switch to this new longer chain. Any transactions in last 4 blocks (on the old \u201cpublic\u201d chain) , including block reward would now not be valid. \n\nIf someone say, cashed out their btc 3-4 blocks before the private chain was released, everything would look legit and coinbase or whoever would likely credit your account with usd. (depending on confirmation requirements, but it\u2019s usually 3) \n\nThe malicious miner would \u201cideally\u201d cash out the usd and then release private chain, reverting the btc they spent (they keep btc and their new usd)\n\nI didn\u2019t read the linked paper, so forgive me if they cover this. But what I just described is also know as a 51% attack or double spend attack.\n\nWith only 20% it would basically just be extreme luck if you are able to crank out 4 high diff shares before anyone else can. Then execute the double spend attack. \n\nLots to read on the subject but overall, it would be very hard to achieve as even 20% of the network would cost a ton in hardware, electricity, etc. so you\u2019d have incentive to not attack the network you \u201cinvested in\u201d",

Due to this happening people will start using multi sig or some other way for a company to prove that they have your bitcoin on hand. If they do have your bitcoin on hand then how would they make money? Which leads me to ask why would they give you a loan for the BTC???\n\nDoes my logic make sense or am I missing a piece of the puzzle? Any thoughts are appreciated.",
