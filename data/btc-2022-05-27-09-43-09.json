Didn't even get anywhere near it's previous ATH last bull market\n\n**Bitcoin Cash is doing great at being an open payment system that is accessible and useful to anyone on this planet from a mobile phone**.  It gets even better with SmartBCH: https://smartbch.org/\n\n\"So what,\" you say? Well, my BTC hodler friend, The greatest value anyone can have is true and unobstructed access (freedom) to an open payment network. \n\nBTC community decided to focus on \"Store-of-Value\" which is obviously not working. I am aware that BTC can be used for payments, but does not make sense to most people on this planet due to adoption and usage costs and requiring new banks (centralized LN Wallets like Chivo or Strike wallets)\n\nBitcoin Cash fixes this!",
