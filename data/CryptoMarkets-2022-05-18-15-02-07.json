However, before buying the dip, the project use case should be considered because not all projects have a good use case in the ecosystem. Railgun, for example, has been consistently innovative despite the market situation and still maintains a price range that makes it significant due to its strong fundamentals. If there are no hiccups in the way, ZEC might start a bullish run, and it wouldn't hurt to look at projects with strong fundamentals before buying.",

Interestingly, some altcoins seem to be doing quite well in terms of price actions. A good example is Railgun which has maintained a consistent price over the month. I believe it has something to do with innovations it just introduced to privacy in decentralized finance. MKR is another one that has stood out in the market. I believe it is more reasonable to spend on dips when a good resistance has been exhibited to an extent, especially for low and mid caps.",
