Scooop a position, adopt the altcoin, sell it to users for post-adoption price, de-adopt the altcoin, price goes back to zero.  That's pump and dump and extremely illegal for stock exchanges.\n\nYou asshats just turned 15 billion dollars into 0 dollars in a few days and there isn't so much as a peep coming from you guys.  That's not cool.  The fact that your earnings are up even after you've destroyed 15 billion dollars of other people's money is something you can ignore and dismiss.  But makes you look bad.\n\nYou're destroying the original thesis of cryptocurrency altogether by handing the government its ability to create cryptocurrency and issue it to itself, and then you're raking transaction fees.  I guess coinbase is just a game of roulette at the Casino?  The ball and the slot aren't money, it's just a game of musical chairs where 10 people put in a dollar, a rake is taken, then 1 person gets $8?\n\nGovernment is going to smile and wave at you, since your customer's losses makes them smile from ear to ear.  Don't spend my money all in one place you crooks who found a sweetheart deal into the sovereign's ability to issue self money in the name of out group.  File it under betrayal, the ancient and timeless definition, a grey area between outright theft and confidence-man swindler.  Word of mouth do its thing please as a goes around comes around correction mechanism.",
