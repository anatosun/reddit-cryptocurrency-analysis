            "selftext": "Hi!\n\nI have a problem with my UST transaction from the platform Hodlnaut to Binance recently. What i did is send UST (selected Ethereum network) from my Hodlnaut account to Binance (also selected ethereum network). On etherscan the transaction is succesfully so i don't really know why the money didn't arrive in my Binance account. \n\nPresumably it has something to do with Wormhole UST. Hodlnaut warns with the following at the deposit/withrawal tab; \"**Please ensure that the designated address is a valid Ethereum address accepting wormhole UST.\"** But Binance doesn't say it doesn't support Wormhole UST, also see this article; [https://www.binance.com/en/how-to-buy/terrausd-wormhole](https://www.binance.com/en/how-to-buy/terrausd-wormhole)\n\nDoes anyone know if i did something wrong, if yes; what i did wrong and what is the best advice for me to do right now? I already filed for a failed deposit in Binance but this takes 30+ business days before I get an update about it. So in the meantime, for my peace of mind, i'm trying to understand the situation, how i can do it right the next time and what the chances are that I will get my money safe.  \n\nAnyone who has the same experience or can tell me more about this problem? \n\nThanks for your help!",
