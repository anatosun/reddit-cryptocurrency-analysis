Simple game theory would suggest the only type of proposal that would get approved is \"buy ENS-tokens from the market and burn them\" or some variation. How does it come that actual public good funding gets approved regularly?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know that much about ENS, so please excuse me if I'm missing basic facts here.",

Even owning a few (3 to 5) quality names will prove to be an excellent investment. \n\nCoinbase and other companies are making ENS names the standard. \n\nGas is incredibly cheap. I minted [this ENS](https://i.imgur.com/zfwO13c.png) name yesterday for $13 (gas + reg). Out the door! I'll gladly post doc - support from Etherscan if you like. \n\nThis is from Etherscan's[gas tracker](https://i.imgur.com/b80OXbV.png). Don't be fooled by false narratives. Gas is cheap. You can easily build a decent name portfolio for $100. \n\nENS names are NFT's with utility. \n\nIf anyone's interested, I can post guidelines on the project. I've bought & sold 41 names. That's not a huge number, but enough to understand all the dynamics of the project. \n\nI truly believe it will develop into Web 3's personal portal. Everyone will need one. I urge you to at least reserve one for personal use in the future. \n\nBest of luck to you.",
