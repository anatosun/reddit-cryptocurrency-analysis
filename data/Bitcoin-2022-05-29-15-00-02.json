I look around and see a collapsing system built upon the ultra rich stealing from just about everybody via \"money printing\".\n\nLook at the dot com bubble, and it's crash.  \n\nThe housing bubble from about 2005-2008, the toxic bullshit Wall St. cooked up... and the subsequent crash.  Oh, my, what \"success\".  The entire global financial system was a few hours away from utter collapse.  That's \"failure\" right there.  They \"had to\" bail out criminals, at our expense, to save their rotten, \"successful\" system.  \n\nLook around today.  Nothing says, \"success\" like negative interest rates for cronies of central banks, and high interest rates for credit cards and payday loans.  Now we have another housing bubble, even bigger than the prior, and it will pop.  We see the artificial stock market bubble is already leaking.  Oh, they'll just lower interest rates again, like they've always done, to \"stimulate the economy\" -- wait!  What's that?  Interest rates are already as low as they can go.  It's big, fat, failure time.  Make some popcorn, find a comfortable place to sit and watch the whole fiat currency based pile of shit system collapse.  \n\nYou call that \"success\".  \n\nStudy some history, boy, and learn that the long-term success stories were using sound money, and when they switched to fiat, they started having massive problems and collapses.  Look at the Great Depression, for example - right after the arrival of the Federal Reserve, whose stated purpose is to prevent shit like that.  \n\nFiat always goes to zero.  Today's fiat currencies are swirling the drain.  \n\nThe smart people have already been loading up on Bitcoin.",

The government wants more businesses to be started so it makes a bet on the innovation of its citizens. It loans to banks, banks loan to businesses. Some fail, some are massive successes and those push everything forward. \n\nEventually, everyone gets too greedy, debt needs to be restructured, and we crash. And the cycle repeats. \n\nBut we can\u2019t have the expansion cycle if we can\u2019t spread around the bets in order to. Take some chances and be rewarded with the big wins. \n\nWho is giving a loan Bezos when he says he\u2019s gonna sell books online and eventually sell EVERYTHING online? Who gives a loan to Elon when he claims electric cars are the future? When the currency is being expanded and loans are cheap, it happens. When you base everything on \u201chard\u201d money risk is severely limited. \n\nIt\u2019s probably better for the average citizen but far worse for the overall economy",

It contains some truths and it sounds sensible.\n\nBut what\u2019s missing is that you can, of course, start a new venture by saving up enough capital as opposed to needing finance, regardless of what these stakeholders say. I know, I\u2019ve done that in the past myself. But it becomes an especially favourable environment to accomplish that when there isn\u2019t constant debasement of your savings, and instead a modest appreciation of the value of those savings over time.\n\nSo the answer is that Bezos and Musk would be productive men, and put away what they earn from being productive, and would have their shot just as they did under our current system. And if they need more capital at any point, then they can always put down assets as security or a stake in the business for the bitcoin they need, and need only to convince investors that their business will produce much greater gains than bitcoin appreciation over time. If you want an example of how easy that will be, just look at shitcoins.\n\nIf you want further proof that it\u2019s not only possible, but ideal, look up the Wright Brothers, who pioneered the aviation industry that transformed the global economy through their creation of the airplane. Read how they funded themselves, and then note the lack of cyclical global economic crisis\u2019s required in their case.\n\nSomething else I\u2019ll add, is you may be overestimating bitcoins appreciation and its volatility in our vision of bitcoin as the world reserve currency. It expands rapidly at the moment, and contracts as investors get spooked, but in the case where it dominates, there\u2019s no-one left to rush in and then rush out, and I personally think its value would be more stable in comparison to goods and services than anything we\u2019ve seen in civilisation prior.",
