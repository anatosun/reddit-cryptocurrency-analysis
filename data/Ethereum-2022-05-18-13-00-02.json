However today that is worth over 120k which most of the world will never achieve. \n\nI'd love to stake myself without joining a pool however it will take me upwards of 10 years at current price to have 32 eth. In lower income countries this is an unfathomable amount of money. With the intent of decentralization shouldn't this be lower? \n\nIs there a specific reason 32 was selected or is there the possibility that this will change in the future?",

                    "response": ">Will the amount of ETH required to run a validator ever be lowered from 32?\n\nShort answer, no.\n\nLong answer:\n\n>There are two choices here that need justification. First, why force validator slots to be a fixed amount of ETH at all, instead of allowing them to be any size? Second, why a fixed size of 32 ETH, and not 1 ETH or 1000 ETH?\n\n>The problem with allowing variable balances is that algorithms for a random selection (eg. of block proposers) and shuffling (for committees) become much more complicated. You would need an algorithm to select a block proposer such that the probability that the algorithm selects a particular proposer is proportional to the proposer's balance, in a context where balances are changing and validators are always entering and exiting. This could be done with fancy binary tree structures but would be complicated. In the case of committee selection, a wealthy validator cannot be assigned to one committee (as they would then dominate and be able to attack it); their weight would need to be split up among many committees. It's much easier to solve both problems by simply formally representing wealthy validators as being many separate validators of the same size.\n\n>The 32 ETH choice is based on this logic: https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735. If the deposit size is higher, then fewer people can participate, risking centralization, but if the deposit size is lower, then the chain suffers a higher cost of verification (\"overhead\" in the post), risking sacrificing decentralization differently.\n\n>Economic review suggests that at the current 32 ETH level the hardware costs of staking are enough to make a significant, though not fatal, dent on validator returns. This implies that if the deposit size were reduced to 16 ETH, then the overhead of the chain would double, and the rewards to each validator would halve, so staking with a single validator slot would be four-times more difficult, already a potentially unsafe level. Hence, 32 ETH is the most inclusive deposit size that does not become self-defeating due to increasing overhead.\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/beacon-chain.md#gwei-values",

That translates to a block every five months per validator. Also more validators means more signatures that need to be checked to follow the beacon chain.\n\nFinally, consider the costs of running a node (you need a full node after the merge).  If you have something like 1 ETH, it will currently make 0.05 ETH per year or 16 USD per month.  That will hardly pay for the server or running cost like better internet connection and electricity.
