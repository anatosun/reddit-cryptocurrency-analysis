Initially, Coinbase will only offer self-help customer support in your region.'\n\nI assume that means Coinbase team is not going to look into my case, but I can't solve it with self-help articles.\n\nBy the phone is a robot that says to visit a support page.\n\nLooking forward to hearing back from you guys.\n\nI've been a member since 2017.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest wishes,\n\nMaksym",
