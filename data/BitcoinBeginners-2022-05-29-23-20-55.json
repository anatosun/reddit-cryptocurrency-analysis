We might go down for a test, but I'm not expecting any further significant downsides.\n\nThe market right now reminds me a lot of Q1 2019, when we hit bottom at $3.2k. So many people were soo sure we were heading down to $1k. But me, I DCA'd, and managed to acquire a whole bitcoin in 3 months for under $4k. The market then took off and the bears got left behind.\n\nNow is the time to DCA until it hurts.",
