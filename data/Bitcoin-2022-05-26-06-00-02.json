It is the bank that risks giving you said credit for the X% they will make off of you paying it back. worse case scenario they get the thing you were trying to buy that you financed with their money. Its why their are so many Fees, atleast in america, for everything in the bank system. hell most banks if you dont hold atleast X amount of dollars in them will charge you a maintenance fee for your account till you reach that threshold and big investors, the bank normally charges a ridiculous amount (in lay-mans money) for basic things like a phone call or even a quartly statement. FOR SHAREHOLDERS OF THE BANK, they showcase how much money is invested or being held in the bank as a bragging rights to show many people use their services, thats all they can do with other people's money without other contractual paperwork.\n\nMy bank for instance, charges me 25 bucks every quarter for a trust i dont have access to due to previous contractual family circumstances. they take the money right out of the account every quarter and send me a packet of the trust information. its literally an envolope with 30 pages that they could just email me, but they are 'legally obligated' to mail a physical copy due to legal reasons. And god help me if i want to talk to them, a phone call to talk to anyone about it is 100 bucks for the first hour for their time... and you should see the fees they tack on for it that they just take right out. Thats how banks make bank in america. crazy charges.\n\nand of course anyone whose ever seen an overdraft fee knows that even 1 penny overdrawn means anywhere from a 10 dollar overdraft fee to 50 dollars overdraft. if you didnt have the money prior to spending it, how are you gonna have the 10-50 bucks to pay it? but you gotta or it'll kill your credit.\n\nShould the bank fail, a certain amount of money is insured, and tax payer money will reimburse you basically up to XXX amount based on whatever the bank's insurance is. all loans will be transfered over to a new parent company that buys the failed bank or a state/federal backed bank. This is all done to prevent another great depression run on the banks should something dire happen and the banks not having the money to give out due to losing it in ill-gotten investments. \n\nJust like in bitcoin, no market is guaranteed. it could raise in the green for 100 years, but 1 bad day, week, month, year, can wipe everything and literal empires can topple, once built on what was thought to be absolute certainty.",

(Central African Republic).\n\nEdit:  Thailand's crypto tax exemption (exemption from VAT) technically is being initially structured to last through the end of 2023).  The C.A.R. situation is more complex, involving the creation of digital real estate, with this (fully digital? partially digital? not sure) island's legislative structure to include the folloiwng: an e-residency program, citizenship by investment, online firm registration, and no income or corporation taxes. C.A.R. now intends to finish the specialized legal framework before the end of the year.  (It looks as though the C.A.R. was possibly inspired in part by [Vanuatu's approach](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/q72oz1/crypto_ban_is_finally_lifted_in_vanuatu_one_of/) and possibly some other countries, like [El Salvador, mentioned as part of a longer prior post in this subreddit here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q4tr8e/bitcoin_people_inc_where_to_go_on_earth_and_outer/).)\n\nAnyway, these countries such as Thailand (if it makes the exemption permanent), and C.A.R. (if it extends the exemption more generally beyond virtual real estate and makes the tax exemption permanent) as well as El Salvador, Vanuatu and Portugal, for example, with their decisions to exempt digital assets from taxation (each in their own way), are definitely on the right track.  I've explained why before in depth [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q9pdca/nobody_should_pay_any_tax_to_any_government_on/) and also [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/q13fh6/of_223_jurisdictions_around_the_world_only_one/) for those who want to get into the weeds on the economics of why it's the right decision.",
