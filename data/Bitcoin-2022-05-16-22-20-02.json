I am about to turn 40.   \n\nLet's say for example ~5-10 years from now I inherited ~$1 million.   A roughly even combination of stocks/bonds, real estate, life insurance lump sum cash, etc... \n\nThis is all just hypothetical - but let's say I have relatively minimal liquid assets and this will compromise the majority of my investable assets besides perhaps some home equity and 401k.\n\n\n Roughly what % of this inheritance would you allocate towards bitcoin?\n\n\n\nTo me I think the average person would probably feel very comfortable allocating 5-10% towards bitcoin esp if it is trading in the $50-$100k range where the math is clean (i.e. one bitcoin is 5-10% of my investable assets).\n\nNow if bitcoin tanks to $3-$6k...  How do you not buy just one or two \"just in case\"... And if it's $250k dont you still allocate at least $50k (5% of NW for 20% of a btc) as its seemingly taken hold as an asset class?",

Yeah diversification is nice but put yourself in a situation where if you could ONLY choose one.  The answer is obvious..at least for me.  The thing is though, in the real world, we can choose multiple things.  I think the best thing is choose a few things not many things\u2026index funds are ok but choose companies you\u2019ve researched or other coins..assets..etc\u2026But in the end any profit I get I personally always find it back in sats maybe us die hard bitcoiners are crazy lol. But we shall see in the coming decade or two.",

Real estate in a low tax booming area with ability to generate rental income/airbnb (think Greater Nashville, Austin TX, Florida) is an acceptable alternative tho I would be slightly concerned about rising interest rates.  Commodities would perhaps be my third choice.   They are risky as these levels but I trust them more than equities.",

If you're used to lottery tickets, sure, it doesnt make sense to diversify between negative EV bets. Slightly smarter people know that diversifying doesnt lower your average EV, just cuts the variance. Take risky +EV bets and diversify between them. The hard part is actually finding good expected returns and much more importantly good *uncorrelated* expected returns.",

Right now, I'm sitting at a 50% allocation of BTC and [crypto stocks](https://www.investortrip.com/cryptocurrency-stocks/) (Coinbase, Marathon Digital, BTCS, etc).\n\nOver time, Bitcoin will grow faster than my other growth stocks and it will naturally reach 80% over time. There are additional risks to Bitcoin and I don't need to go all-in to build a substantial nest egg.\n\n50% exposure is more than enough for me and I still buy Bitcoin before ANYTHING ELSE when I receive my regular paycheck.

Day traders who only want to make more fiat are the ones who cause bubbles.  They buy in with a big check or a big line of credit and cause the price to rise a bit.  This rallies the market with lots of small investors looking to \"ride the wave\" and the price rises even higher.  But as soon as the price begins to hover, indicating that the market has reached full saturation, the fat cat who started it all cashes out and the music stops playing.  That triggers a panic sell off and the price crashes back to normal with most investors losing their shirts.  What 2021 and 22 have taught me is that the 'normal', unmolested, market price of Bitcoin is somewhere between 28k and 30k.  Same as it was last January and August, between the spring and fall bubbles, and now.",
