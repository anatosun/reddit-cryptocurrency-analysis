It can also be used for manufacturing (much more than most think) and luxury goods.\n\nBtc only mass \u00ab\u00a0utility\u00a0\u00bb is the potential as a future inflation hedge and a non-inflationary asset. However as it\u2019s performance tracks closer to the nasdaq rather than gold, is it still logical to call it as an inflation hedge? Others would argue that it can be used as a payment method for cheap, secure, traceable and border less transactions (which is true and totally amazing) but governments don\u2019t seem to be eager to let this happen.\n\nSo where are we standing right now as of per utility (which should lead to a higher buying pressure and even higher prices due to non inflationary asset status)?\n\nCheers",

Of course Bitcoin is built upon the theory to be used like cash. I doubt that governments will allow that. However also through history people tend to use barter a lot. I can see that Bitcoin is closer to like an universal barter asset rather than a currency itself (we have some countries using it as such but no history to tell if it will work out well after all). So should Bitcoin be more like a non inflationary asset this better to store than cash but not especially as effective as stock (not only on returns but risk reward ratio)? I\u2019m invested in Bitcoin just trying to understand because it seems confusing: people say Bitcoin is both a currency and a risky asset which doesn\u2019t make sense in the way that both these have totally different characteristics",

Imagine the same story but instead of gold, fiat being backed by BTC. A verifiable, limited, infinitely divisible asset that is mined through proof of work (like gold)\n\nBitcoin is also easier to transact with directly compared to literal gold. This is why people consider it as a possible currency. \n\nIf the gold/fiat supply was trusted, then you also wouldn't transact with your precious gold. That's what fiat is for. Same with BTC. Hold BTC, spend fiat.\n\nTruth is Bitcoin is many things. Store of value, digital energy (because unusable electricity can be used to mine Bitcoin) transactable medium (currency), a collectible (because it's limited and supply gets lower everytime somebody loses their BTC wallet keys) \n\nBTC beats gold. BTC beats fiat. Its more scarce than gold, easy to transfer across the world, non-corruptible, decentralized, verifiable. \n\nIt's an alternative to our current Fiat/gold standard, and the only missing component is adoption.",

Currently Fiat is preferred, and fiat has problems because the supply is inflated and it's backed by inflated gold.\n\nIf fiat was backed by btc, then Fiat would still get printed and inflated, but it wouldn't get inflated at the base (btc)\n\nTherefore you would hold btc and exchange it and transact in whatever medium the stores prefer.",
