If there were enough tokens for people to hoard them, they already had too much circulating supply in the first place and there wasn\u2019t enough demand for babysitting. It\u2019s a particularly dumb because in the article he says that people only go out every once and a while. This is much different with money, where you have to spend it to survive and people selling will prefer the best money in return for their goods. If you need it, you\u2019ll buy it.\n\nKrugman is a stooge.\n\nOn top of this, bitcoin doesn\u2019t need to be a currency. The dollar and credit system can all be layered on top of Bitcoin.",

Even fee-less payments in the US actually cost a minimum of ten to fifteen cents to the banks themselves.\n That's not even counting wire transfers which are not usually allowed (for one reason or another) to be used by individuals for less than $25.\nAlso, it's less than the cashapp cash-in cash-out fee. Also less than the xoom money transfer fee, western union fees, literally all banking systems. Only exception possibly is phone-based money transfer in kenya  although that still has fees they are economical compared to ones in western systems\nEdit;realized India phone pay is just subsidized wire transfers.

They saw the uncontrolled wallet services for digital payments and decided to make a framework for all payments. The result was UPI(Unified Payment Interface).\n\nThat basically forces all payment apps to partner with banks and all transfers are going from bank account to bank account for free. There's no wallet redemption charges like Venmo or anything. And all payment apps need to play nice with each other, so I don't need to worry about which app the other person is using or which bank is being used by the other person. RIght now, Amazon pay, google pay, facebook/whatsapp money all use the UPI and you don't need to deposit anything in wallets to use the service. (Even lightning networks runs outside bitcoin's blockchain with you having to put some money in when you start and have to pay charges for settling)\n\nThis resulted in the astronomical growth of digital payments in India to the point that in 2016, the volume was 2.65 million per year. In 2021, volume was 38.744 billion per year. The act of transaction is very fast, you can enter mobile number or just scan QR code at a shop and within 10-15 seconds, your transaction will be done and shopkeeper will get confirmation as well. \n\nDebit, credit cards of visa and mastercard have merchant discount rate(MDR). If I pay 1000 bucks using credit card, the shop will only get 980 and the 20 will go to visa. India decided it was stupid that 2% of all transactions goes to banks and released their own card, on top of UPI with 0% MDR. That means businesses are no longer accepting visa and master cards. Why would they accept a payment method where their payment is getting cut? (Visa actually complained about this to USA lol. They were getting undercut completely)\n\nThis also means all the very small shops and roadside vendors can print their QR codes and take payments of tiny sums like 10 rs (around 14 cents) on UPI. (You can also send large amounts on UPI of course.) They don't need to worry about keeping change and all that. They anyway don't pay taxes because they don't earn enough. This is possible because India gives free zero balance bank accounts to everyone. No overcharge, no draft fees, no minimum balance and all that bullshit. You are living in India, you get a free bank account because PM decided that banking is basic need.\n\nI've literally not taken my physical wallet or carried cash 95% of the times in recent years because India also allows for digital IDs, so I can have all my documents online and it's just as acceptable as physical copy when cops ask for it. And all this is perfectly possible everywhere in the world, but you need a government willing to cut the exploitation of the banks. \n\nThe Indian government and banks are happy to pay for all the costs for now because a large portion of the cash/black economy is now digital and linked to bank accounts. So, their tax collection and bank usage has increased by more than enough that UPI is making profits for them despite 0 transaction fees. And there are other benefits of not having to print and handle cash. Government can directly deposit any social payments and subsidies to the bank accounts without middlemen doing any corruption as well.\n\nThere have been some rumours of adding some transaction fees to UPI, banks can charge for transactions but nothing has materialized and it likely won't happen anytime soon because the government can benefit from the digital economy even after paying out of pocket. They are expanding the framework outside India in other countries now. Right now, apps are also using the UPI data to make credit ratings and give microloans to people because they can estimate risks from the financial data which would've been very hard to get otherwise.  \n\n\nAfter all that, it seems stupid to use bitcoin as currency because it's costly, slow and not at all user friendly. Not to mention volatility. (I still don't get how India with 5-10% inflation and US with 0-5% inflation and turkey with 40-50% inflation can use the same currency across the world. )",

Mind you, 3127 transactions is high, if you look at the blocks around the it, they're bouncing between 1000-2900 txs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, another consideration this subreddit never talks about is the fact that block subsidy is the driving factor for all the miners right now, in the same block I referenced earlier, the paid fees were $6,532 (again this was a block with much higher transactions than the average blocks around it), while the block subsidy was $191,109. Miners are in the game for block sub, once that dwindles you'll most likely see miners dropping out since there's no way the current fee schedule is offsetting the loss of subsidy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone talks about lightning but that competes against the miners and their rightful earnings of fees for on-chain transactions. In the next few years it'll be very interesting how the community and developers attempt to mitigate these problems to keep the network/hype train going.",

You could have Visa like speeds at virtually no costs, just settling on the background. \n\nIt really doesn't matter even if it's centralised. You store you coins, move what you need \"as currency\" and use whatever L2 solution exists. It's like moving from saving account (cold storage) to current account (hot storage/coinbase/whatever).",

How many stories are there of people losing their wallets or celebrities getting scammed out of their coins. Properly securing and managing a self wallet is significantly more difficult because the risk is tremendously high. With non-self custody like in traditional finance you generally have some level of insurance, with self custody if someone swipes your keys or you forget them or are conned out of it when you\u2019re 60, you\u2019ll end up with no money",

They are simply a phrase that decrypts to a wallet private key.\n\nA wallet is a public key and a private key. The Public key is the receive address. The private key can me typed into any node that is part of the BTC network and used to trasact from that wallet. You can generate wallets (keypairs) all day long. There are many sites that can do this, or you can do it yourself locally using the BTC client.\n\nAt any exchange I know of, you can simply type in your private key and make the contents of that wallet available on the exchange. If you do not want to move the entire contents, you either have to set up a full BTC node and send the desired amount from the wallet, or import the whole wallet and then send the part you do not want on the exchange to a new private key pair(wallet).\n\nHardware wallets are just encrypted flash drives with a private key stored in them.\n\nSeed phrases use a 3rd party algorithm to encrypt/decrypt a private key and have nothing to do with the way BTC actually works.",

There are work arounds for inflation like governments who can adjust their inflation by adjusting their loan rates. We\u2019re unsure what governments will arise in 30 years and how they will approach their own countries inflation. The US previous president prioritized investing which did well for the market but also made inflation more rampant. Obviously the pandemic played a huger role with inflation but that\u2019s an example of how it can change by a government. The current US government is trying to combat inflation. Look what that\u2019s done to Bitcoin (last interest raise was around our recent crash)\n\nWe\u2019re also assuming 20% of the world money supply will be tied up in Bitcoin. If people only buy and hold. That is an insane projection because that\u2019s not including stock markets market caps, real estate, etc. Currently Bitcoin is around 1-2% of the world money supply. I\u2019d say it\u2019s safer to assume it might hit 5% of the market supply which would be around $350k following your math and assuming inflation is constant.\n\nAlso, if 20% of the market supply is tied to an asset no body spends it would likely cause hyperinflation due to the lack of money supply. Which in that case, the price of Bitcoin may be higher but it would be impossible to speculate price at that point. \n\nFor Bitcoin to be 20% and not experience hyperinflation it would have to be used as a currency and be spent daily.

These big falls are large short positions opening. These are either really dumb traders at this point as resistance is fierce under 30- or more likely, they are using leveraged shorts to accumulate unleveraged coin at lower prices.\n\nEither way shorts create short interest which are orders for BTC that have to be purchased. With the number of times BTC has climbed back up over 30 only to drop in a matter of minutes, she's about to pop. All that purchase volume has to be filled.  Analysts calling for 36k. Intend to think 37-38 with retail fomo.\n\nThey are also claiming a bigger fall in the works after the pop which is plausible, but unlikely to me. With how much the market has already fallen, I just don't think there are enough people in the money to create a deeper dip. It's a tough call though. Some people who are buried may just try to exit. I call up to 37, down to 33 then gradual upward momentum. Momentum could be rapid if traditional markets begin to recover, which they should considering that inflation reportedly dropped to 4%. I think  investors are still waiting to see how this effects the CPI next month.",

Whales unload sometimes but not always as many bought anywhere below 6k and don\u2019t really care about short mid term price fluctuations.\n\nMaybe it will be more relevant later on but so far has not produced any solid price movements",

                                    "response": "The exchange keeps it all in one custodial wallet though, right?  I mean, if an exchange has 1 million different customers, each with 0.1 BTC, then they would keep those 100,000 BTC in one wallet - the exchange's wallet.  Now, if a few people on the exchange want to send their BTC somewhere, well then that BTC is \"liquid\".  So the exchange's wallet would be fully liquid, with 100,000 BTC of liquidity.  \n\nBut.  If those same 1 million people each took their 0.1 BTC off the exchange and into cold storage...then 1 year later the only \"liquid\" amount of BTC from those wallets, will be the wallets that have had some transaction.  Which would be a much smaller amount than the 100,000 coins.  So the chart will show much less in this second scenario.  \n\nSo I'm saying, maybe this chart just shows a high illiquid supply, because the word has successfully gotten out to keep your Bitcoin in your wallet, get it off the exchange, not-your-keys-not-your-coin, all that jazz.",

                    "response": "Long term I wonder if a combination of this and the lost wallet problem will contribute to deflationary pressure. ie if an asset is known to only decrease in supply and price only goes up over time, the tendency to hold becomes even stronger, opening up a feedback loop where people hold because it will go up, people lose keys because of human error, which causes supply to dwindle, which drives price up, which causes people to hold, etc. I'm sure many PhD candidate economists will spend years working on elaborate arguments for or against one day. Will be interesting to see. I does tend to suggest price action in the next two halvings won't be boring lmao.",

And then? The dollar is still worthless. So what they going to do? Bitcoin would be the first currency in a long time that came from the people. Of course there is some \"crazy factors\" but if you looked a bit into Bitcoin, you cannot really deny its technology and its role in the world as the first global financial network kinda like early internet.

Its apples and oranges. \n\nPeople do use gold and reits as generic investment classes.\n\n> So I hope you went in just as hard on OP by raising the obvious point that real estate is neither fungible nor portable.\n\nReal estate is in fact typically bundled up to make it so; REITs, MBS's, and ETF's and other investment instruments attempt to allow a person to generically invest in \"real estate\". And plenty of people invest in buying an actual property and turning it over to a management firm. There is one hell of a bubble in it right at the moment.\n\nWhen those common widely held investments become super lucrative, people can increase the supply. And are.\n\nBut unique items, like for example, your bunghole, are not typical stores of value and their rigid supply doesnt matter, and it is not relevant to the discussion.",

However as it\u2019s performance tracks closer to the nasdaq rather than gold, is it still logical to call it as an inflation hedge?

Of course Bitcoin is built upon the theory to be used like cash. I doubt that governments will allow that. However also through history people tend to use barter a lot. I can see that Bitcoin is closer to like an universal barter asset rather than a currency itself (we have some countries using it as such but no history to tell if it will work out well after all). So should Bitcoin be more like a non inflationary asset this better to store than cash but not especially as effective as stock (not only on returns but risk reward ratio)? I\u2019m invested in Bitcoin just trying to understand because it seems confusing: people say Bitcoin is both a currency and a risky asset which doesn\u2019t make sense in the way that both these have totally different characteristics",

It is a currency to two small countries. It is not a payment method. A payment method is something that allows you to pay with a currency such as a wire transfer or a debit card. Bitcoin network allows to transfer bitcoins.\n\nIn that sense, if people accept Bitcoin as a mean to pay for a produce or services then it makes it a barter as salt used to be back in the time. If someone sells you a house for btc it does not make btc a currency. It just makes that the seller of the house sees value in an asset that you own and accepts it to transact to get his house.\nIn that same way, if you have a beautiful watch and you went to buy a car. Someone offers you to switch a car for you watch. Does that make one of these a currency? No. It\u2019s barter. Just like when people accept Bitcoin (an asset) to get their house. It\u2019s barter. Not a currency. Not a \u00ab\u00a0payment method\u00a0\u00bb.\n\nAt best it\u2019s some kind of more or less widely accepted asset to pay for something (and still I\u2019d be happy to see how many goods or services have been bought last year using btc)",

If it still becomes a problem after that, then an emergency fork could limit block creation in other ways.  The only way quantum breaks bitcoin is if a sudden advancement breaks the entire encryption algorithm and you're able to calculate private keys from public ones.  If that happens then it is very likely that *everyone* is fucked whether they own bitcoin or not.  A computer that powerful probably means that all data moving around online is exposed and we go back in time by 50 years.  So yeah... bitcoin will be the least of our worries.",

I do believe the volatility will start to slow as a larger part of the global economy moves into Bitcoin, and I do believe on balance that I will profit off being early, but I buy Bitcoin as a moral protest against fiat. Honest money controlled by a distributed network with agreed rules is better than money based on lies, blood and political power.  Real estate is overpriced precisely because fiat is untrustworthy. Gold is honest and has a predictably low inflation rate but has been corrupted by fiat custodians. Bitcoin is our only hope of beating the bastards.",
