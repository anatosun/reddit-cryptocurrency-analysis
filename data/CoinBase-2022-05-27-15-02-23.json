I need some help understanding how this coinbase card works, I have a CDC.com card and I top up that card, the money I then spend on that card gets cashback and then converted to CRO, which is stored on a different portion of the app under my current crypto assets, after using this card it seems there is no way to directly \u2018top up\u2019 my Visa card but rather send money to the app and then buy crypto using that which then can be used on the card? Is there any way for me to Just simply put say \u00a310 on the card, spend it and then just choose what cashback I want? It seems the only way I have is to send \u00a310 to my coinbase account, buy a crypto asset, spend 99p doing so, then risk that money going down while I wait to spend it on daily things",
