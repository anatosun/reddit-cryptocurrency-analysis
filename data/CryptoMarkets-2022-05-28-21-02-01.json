How was the crash a scam? What is your definition of scam by the way? Of course, Luna messed up pretty bad and there was a lot of losses. I made a big loss too in all the crazy stuff. Perhaps you did as well. But just calling an investment that went wrong a scam is not the best thing.",

Getting back the trust of the community is a long shot but there is nothing wrong in acknowledging the fact that there is an obvious effort to recover the entire chain and keep it active. There is a whole lot more to look forward to besides the pump and dump. It was totally predictable before it all started but there is more at play here",
