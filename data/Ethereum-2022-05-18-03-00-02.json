You should use the ENS Public Resolver contract (`0x1da022710df5002339274aadee8d58218e9d6ab5`).\n\nOnce you set the default resolver, any translation of `yourname.eth` will be handled by it (ENS default in this case). However, you still must tell the ENS Public Resolver to map `yourname.eth` to your wallet address.\n\nThe reasoning for this decoupled approach using a resolver is so that if you wanted to develop your own smart contract with logic of translating your domain to a wallet address you could. For 99% of people the ENS Public Resolver is what you want (simple translation to a wallet address).",
