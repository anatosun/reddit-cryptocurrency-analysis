            "selftext": "Before I was in high school (2013 or earlier), my dad & his 2 buddies dropped, collectively, just under $10 000 on this bitcoin generator that sits in my dads basement.\n\nI was too young to grasp the concept of it. \n\nI recently found out that bitcoin is worth about $50K Canadian for 1 coin.  \n\nRealistically speaking, how does this bitcoin generator work? Is my dad a secret millionaire? \n\nI asked my dad about bitcoin (obviously not his bank account balance - I know he\u2019s very well off because of his job & his insanely good money habits) but he said he didn\u2019t even have one bitcoin\u2026. But what the fuck was the  $10000 generator doing then??\n\nGenuinely curious but I know very little about this stuff; wouldn\u2019t that generator have generated a few bitcoins at the very least? Especially considering the price of bitcoin in 2013 vs 2022?",

If your Dad ran it consistently for a few years immediately after obtaining it, he may have quite a few BTC.\n\nPower it up and see if you can find the wallet address it mined to. Beautiful thing about BTC: if you know the address, you know everything that happened to the coins.",
