            "selftext": " It is often said that Bitcoin is everything you don't understand about money combined with everything you don't understand about computers. There's nothing to relate it to, as Satoshi remarked \n\nBitcoin is different things to different people. Not only that, but what we mean when we say \"bitcoin\" depends on context, among other things \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9y1zfmu39zx81.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c471e2b19f19add36d6ee81ca9e199c3a992cf0\n\nBreaking apart this loop is what 21 Ways is about. However, it's almost impossible to talk about Bitcoin in any meaningful way without a brief discussion of the building blocks that make Bitcoin work. \n\nFirst of all, understanding how public-key cryptography and digital signatures work is absolutely essential. While Bitcoin seems magical, its nuts and bolts are anything but. Key generation, message signing, and message verification are mathematical operations \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pvsxmqly9zx81.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=860631ea5e5c18a8b8fa6bda1b26ebc909de2c9a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b8a7ih10azx81.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90dde9b33f2aa5fa7ee0d77a59c77a2bd4f5b021\n\n Hash functions are another essential building block. They are crucial to identify and verify information in a decentralized system. In Bitcoin, they are used for mining, generating addresses, identifying redeem scripts, identifying transactions, blocks, and more. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/blw6we88azx81.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b378e2e5577dc2f06d16dfcaf3c8b9fbc3822b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uz18vrj9azx81.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4c0640010c73eb5e1231d7e00997c19bb9cfb49\n\nThe problem with regular computer networks is a political one. Traditional computer networks usually follow the client-server model, which puts one server in charge as the central authority of the network. The solution? Make everyone an equal participant by design: peer-to-peer. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ww0xdo6iazx81.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d6f8a0bdd68aba04c15fd94a186be185c736031\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kqx571yjazx81.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=794cd22bef7273fc489dfc1b7265881ac1757b2f\n\nOnce these building blocks and Bitcoin's operation are properly understood, it becomes clear that this often-used picture is an oversimplification, to put it mildly. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h4bo182oazx81.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e0e059f53fdc05ef111672e6f6e0b811792be1c\n\nA more accurate picture would be the following: sats are in locked vaults floating in the sky. If you know the magic spell, you can open your lock and create new vaults that you can seal with someone else's lock. Sats do not exist outside of vaults. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pjrasdatazx81.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11eecb92e3aa8e82006efb4949900422ff5bcc0a\n\n Confusing? No doubt. But it gets easier as you study and get comfortable with these concepts.   In the end, Bitcoin is a network that is incredibly hard to corrupt and keeps everyone and everything honest\u2014producing a truthful ledger, recording who owes what to whom \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2yuyy2frbzx81.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4acffd793a844727d97a12c1006cc943b350ad6d\n\nAll The credit should go to :  u/dergigi \n\nLink To his twitter : [https://twitter.com/dergigi](https://twitter.com/dergigi)",

They know that Bitcoin is money that the government can't control, that goes up in value, and that is being adopted by countries. What they don't get, is what makes it decentralised, why other cryptos are not decentralised, and how fucked their fiat really is.\n\nThey have just enough information to want to ignore the technical stuff: \"Oh, I get it, government can't control it\", but not enough to become part of the solution.\n\nThat has been my experience.\n\nBitcoin is not safe if the majority of its users are using the same custodial service provider, because that means that this service provider now has enough resources to attack Bitcoin, or to be coerced to attack Bitcoin, and your average holder will have no idea what is going on, why, and they will inevitably keep making bad decisions which is bad for them, but also bad for Bitcoin.\n\nIMO, it's the fiat that needs to be explained, once they see the bed of nails below them, they'll want to understand how to keep Bitcoin the way it is now.",

Ask how long they've gone without food. Answer is about 24 hours. Clean water? Cellphone? That Civil War would last 24 hours before people realized just how amazing their lives were. Nobody is logging out from Twitter, putting down their phone for more than an hour, picking up a gun they're afraid to put a scratch on, and preparing for death. The only war we're engaging in is on the Xbox where we level up our GTA character and finish 2 bags of potato chips. So thank god for bitcoin that it is in fact a peaceful revolution, and requires nothing more than the language of the masses (tap, swipe, click) to exchange fiat for bitcoin. \n\nWWIII on the other hand is quite likely, although it'll look much different than world wars of the past. As for civil wars, I can see one in the Middle-East with a famine, possibly in Russia, and Turkey too.",

I use to wonder how can crypto be anonymous when these exchanges ask for verification when signing up and later found out there is non-custodial wallet. I am still reading about this so please forgive me if I am wrong.  I learned there are wallets such as Ledger Nano X where one can store crypto. From my understanding, these are non custodial wallets which means only you have control over these wallets. My question is how do people purchase bitcoin and where do they purchase bitcoin and put them onto the noncustodial ledger. Does that also mean the government cannot take or freeze the crypto. . Also are these noncustodial wallets safe and anonymous.",

Any concerns in the slightest reach out to the manufacturer and/or ask here. \n\nAlways ignore your direct messages. \n\nDepending on how much you bought you may even want to buy 2 cold wallets and store the seed phases in separate places. \n\nWelcome aboard!",

Do you know what happened? Bitcoin waited it out while the shitcoiners haemorrhaged money and transferred it to miners. When they ran out of money business resumed as normal.\n\nIt is, imo, probably impossible to destroy now. Governments can suppress it by restricting access to centralised exchanges and so on, but they cannot destroy bitcoin.\n\nSome moon boys that are in it to quintuple their net worth in the next 5 years might be put off by this, but bitcoin's mission was never to satisfy greedy speculators. It was to free individuals from those that would control them by wielding centrally issued currencies as a weapon. It can do this without governments, without centralised exchanges, without hodlers, without moons and lambos. And what's more it's the only cryptocurrency that can survive this kind of attack. Bans have shown time and time again just how useless they are at stopping the use of bitcoin as a p2p currency.\n\nSmarter people than I can see this coming, and it doesn't scare them. Infact some of them want to see bans in order to tidy up the ecosystem, remove exploitative companies, and attacks on the protocol from regulated mining bodies etc. I'm starting to sympathise with this point of view.",

Given we can make a single asset move quickly, store value, provide sovereignty, and all the other qualities we want\u2013why arbitrarily make a different asset for some of those things? This is an old mindset stuck thinking there needs to be two things like physical gold and fiat notes. The digital space does not need a different asset to accomplish high transaction volume with a fixed supply.\n\nI'm open to other digital assets to represent ownership of equity or physical properties. I'm even open to a digital \"debt\" ledger denoting an owed sum (measured in Bitcoin) with interest (measured in Bitcoin) once Bitcoin has matured a lot more.\n\nThe crypto world believes in this interoperability world of many blockchains with their own assets to denote transaction fees, sub protocol fees, etc. and the reality is that this creates a permanently inaccessible system for the layman population. This is untenable because the barrier to adoption is not about easier to understand applications but a highly complex set of arbitrary units of account.\n\nPeople do not want to be holding a bunch of different currencies that fluctuate in price based on how many people are using this or that lending protocol. They want DeFi applications where the usage fees are dependent on a single core unit of account (Bitcoin) or they don't want it at all.\n\nThe only possible way another chain could take Bitcoin is if it somehow took this single unit of account approach, while simultaneously developing the same degree of confidence in its fixed monetary policy, its decentralization, and its wide distribution. Lots of interesting technical achievements going on in the broader space, but none of them are even close to doing this yet.",

Using access points to the blockchain such as MetaMask or any centralized exchange such as Binance or CoinBase breaks the decentralization. As far as I know, one cannot do otherwise, right? Is there actually a way to actually achieve this? i.e can one send tokens from one address to another without passing by a centralized entity? I feel like all of this is a bit contradictory to the initial motive behind the movement, and that the whole community is more focused on other benefits of crypto and blockchains than anonymity. This might be because of the blockchain trilemma and the fact that the demand is mostly for security and speed, rather than decentralization.",

Unfortunately there are a fuck ton of coins in custody of those platforms.   So there are very much plenty of coins to be sold and bring the price down.  \n\n  There is absolutely no supply problem currently nor will there be until people put the shit in there own care and lock it away.  \nJust shifting back and forth..... borrow, sell, price drops, buy back, return coins , keep profit.  Wash and repeat.  But people just must have that 2% APY.   Until those people get their head out of their asses and stop using those places, we ain't going no where fast.

This concept differs from the reliance in a dependent relationship, where some members are dependent and some are not. There can be various degrees of interdependence.\n\nso when satoshi said 'system' do you think he meant for bitcoin to be turned into paper bitcoin i.o.u's? or maybe he meant for bitcoin to be interdependant within a 'verified' (proof of reserves) type of electronic cash system such as all of the coins have the potential to do proof of reserves for verification 24/7/365?\n\n---and who are the ones setting up all of these bitcoin paper i.o.u's?",

I don't know, but if he is Satoshi, then yes Satoshi envisioned it and predicted it.\n\n\"I predict that fractional reserve Bitcoin banks will exist. They'll make loans and pay interest, just as banks have done for centuries.\" \n\n\u2012 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4782.msg70107#msg70107\n\n\"Actually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.\n\nBitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.\n\nGeorge Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.\n\nI believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the \"high-powered money\" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.\"\n\n\u2012 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2500.msg34211#msg34211",

Not sure how many exactly now, I would hit the faucets for 5-10 minutes every day for ~4 months, there had to be at least 6-700 minimum, could be in the thousands. \n\nThat stick was water proof and was likely dropped in a bar/tavern parking lot somewhere in Racine, WI. Probably behind the Blind Alligator. I looked but not that hard, BTC was still <.01\u00a2 at the time.",

Before we start here, please smash those likes and if you're new to the channel make sure you subscribe and turn on the bell notifications so you don't miss any of my daily videos. So as you can see here, Bitcoin has just formed a triple bottom and triple top formation. The bullinger bands are tightening. Incredibly bullish if we break up and bearish if we break down. But you know me, I AM INCREDIBLY BULLISH LONG TERM. That is all for today\nDo you think Bitcoin is bullish or bearish? Drop a comment and let me know. Don't miss tomorrow's video where I tell you that Bitcoin did exactly as I predicted. CryptoSomething out! \"",

And on top of that, everyone would still be able to use Twitter for free. The difference is that if an influencer makes a tweet then he/she can limit who replies by adding an option for yellow-checkmark people only. Influencers that don't opt-in for that option would still have everyone with no limits replying to them and whoever doesn't pay would still have the option to make their own tweets.\n\nAlso, having people opt in for this would pump the bitcoin price lol.",

Yes, they don\u2018t like Bitcoin, don\u2018t care about Bitcoin, don\u2018t understand Bitcoin. \n\nYet, they are both among the greatest value investors of all time. I would not dismiss them, even if I disagree.\n\nI think they get it wrong. Bitcoin is a different asset class than equity in a company. It\u2018s value is not derived from future cashflow and assets, but from it\u2018s properties and the strength of its network. To be fair, nobody knows yet how that is properly valuated. I think it\u2018s still undervalued for what it is.\n\nI can forgive old school investors to not understand that. They also probably have seen any investment fraud under the sun.",

Everything else relies on external factors and is bound to collapse once these external factors provide false inputs. \n\n It goes even deeper than that: The problem of synchronizing clocks is ultimately an insoluble one. Bitcoin offers a practical solution to this impossible problem.  You can not solve this problem without introducing a new arrow of time, a distinction between past and future. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gvk0sr1l10y81.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=400c8daf4b1804f52293016849a1cdaf34c807ff\n\n The link between time and heat is fundamental: without heat, a distinction between past and future is impossible.  Without a distinction between past and future, a ledger - something that keeps track of things - is impossible. \n\n Once you understand the profundity of the problem, the beauty of Bitcoin's probabilistic solution becomes obvious.  Synchronization via a difficulty-adjusted proof-of-work is the innovation. \n\nAll Credit Should Go To : [https://twitter.com/dergigi](https://twitter.com/dergigi)",

From the date/time data present within the operating system (or motherboard). Where does that come from? Ultimately, centralized systems online that broadcast the time, maintained by central authorities.\n\nNormally that's not a problem. But if you're building a decentralized system that aspires to compete with worldwide centralized banking, you don't want to introduce such a vulnerable vector of attack and add it to their arsenal.\n\n>I found these references to physics underwhelming.\n\nYou're right. References to physics are underwhelming, because in the end all hardware and software is based on physics. But that doesn't make it any less true. Proof of work takes advantage of that physics property to add further decentralization than it would otherwise be possible.",

There are still unresolved issues with bitcoin and it\u2019s far from certain that it will replace gold (or  become the go-to asset for everyone around the world) I hate to see bitcoiners constantly proclaiming bitcoin is going to eat the world and all these dinosaurs are gonna bend their knees and capitulate. We\u2019d all love to see that but it\u2019s not a done deal. Far from it. People get complacent as if it\u2019s all gonna be inevitable. Bitcoin can still be vulnerable to a lot of attacks. Dalio is one of those more open minded billionaires and he seems always ready to change his mind when presented with new information. So I have to agree with him that bitcoin still faces plenty of challenges, we are just at the beginning of the \u201cthen they fight us\u201d stage. Talking hyperbitcoinisation and bitcoin standard as if we have a crystal ball into the future is just bad thinking. We need to go out and convince people why bitcoin is good, esp in the face of ESG attack these days. After all, it\u2019s just a network and if not enough people using this network it\u2019s useless. When ppl are skeptical about bitcoin and all we do is give them a middle finger yelling HFSP only make them all the more entrenched in the opposite camp. We want to get every help we can rather than a bunch of ppl who are so at odds with us they take every little chance to undermine it just because they hold grudges.",

But if you are in Congo with the same thousand dollars, nothing might happen because those dollars are not revered by the local community.\n\nTo really crystallize for average Joe how Bitcoin can be the foundational money, we must have at least one physical community where Bitcoin is the desired asset.
