He is only 25 years younger than Warren Buffett, but he is a billionaire and he isn't one of those people that \"needs\" bitcoin. He has so much money that he could probably find a way send it to North Korea without using bitcoin or cryptocurrency and find a way to conceal it - and if he were to be caught I'm sure he would only get a slap on the wrist.              \n\nWithout lingering on any billionaires in particular, when they reach that status, they have access to financial services that you and I do not. I don't want to put the Winklevoss twins on a pedestal that is any higher or lower than Bill Gates (or vice versa), but I'm pretty sure that both parties can get access to better banking services than 99% of the people who are browsing this sub right now.                \n\nThe kind of way that we hold idols and their remarks towards something is entirely unimportant because it changes nothing. Maybe it's a technology thing. Who knows? I've been buying bitcoin since 2017, but didn't start using uber or uber eats until 2021. Last but not least, I don't see the reason why a billionaire would need bitcoin in this lifetime.",

But as with pretty much every apex civilization in history, America is going to go down printing. Its been a broken system since 2008, if not earlier, and now its all starting to unravel. The Winklevos, Elon, Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates all know this, and right now every Government, Billionaire or wannabe Billionaire is needing to decide what they are going to do about a falling power. Some want Gold, and there will be Gold Countries. Some want Bitcoin, and there will be Bitcoin countries. But most at the moment are holding their faith in the US dollar, despite the inflation, and suggest that those seeking alternative are currently crazy. \n\nThe US in particular is strong enough to persist on FIAT alone for some time, but Billionaires lose out in extreme inflation too. As bad as inflation is right now, this is far from over. Inflation moves in waves and right now we are barely around the peak of the first wave. The crash down from here will trigger a response so powerful that inflation will be impossible to control. THAT is the situation that these billionaires are preparing for. We're still in the second quarter of this story, and Bitcoin has just entered the room.\n\nMany of us here agree with the Winklevos, whether we like them or hate them or neither, that Bitcoin is a unique financial instrument and a convenient payment option that may grow to be ubiquitous. We trust the lifeboat ethos of HODLR support and a powerful deep rooted network, the only thing we don't know is what the boat is actually made of, so we need to invest at our own risk.",
