I got into crypto in 2017 because fuck the banks,  corporations and governments... also because I'd like to retire before my body gives out.  my career is heavy manual labor and my body isn't going to last forever,  at this rate... I'm in need of surgery on both shoulders,  my knees... and my back is royally fucked.",

They include the entrepreneur types, the pragmatists who don't care so much about how it works but rather that it delivers on its promises.\n\nSelf-empowerment might be a bit more appealing way of marketing #2 rather than removing government power, even if ultimately, more power in the hands of the people means less centralized power and maybe that can be equated with \"remove power from governments\".\n\nBut let's keep in mind that people are frequently attached to their government, esp. if the previous government was worse. Ok, so governments right now aren't doing too well _on average_. We need to point out that it's money that often buys a ticket to freedom when government turns oppressive. And when the state or its subservient institutions (like central banks and their regulated downstream commercial banks) start to enforce state ideology, then suddenly the citizen's access to money can become precarious. We saw this in the case of Canada where big banks jumped in to play censors against the truckers who protested against violations of the peoples' rights, freezing peoples' accounts and handing over account details of suspected dissidents to government. This can easily happen anywhere, and cryptocurrencies help protect people against such \"emergency\" situations just as much as they can help in improving regular transacting (if governments / banks weren't putting regulation obstacles in the way all the time).",

That\u2019s cool when the parties involved are already trusted and known. Buying dinner or concert tickets or sending money to a friend. \n\nAt some point, further crypto adoption is going to require infrastructure for more sophisticated types of financial transactions. Loans, Credit, escrow, assurance, custodial services are not going away just because of a currency blockchain. Those services exist because there is some inherent need, risk, or flaw with a counterparty in the transaction that is totally agnostic to the form of payment. Right or wrong large financial institutions have dominated the market for those service. Hence the disproportionate power you mention. But is a scattered network of De-Fi companies tasked with building that infrastructure (complete with their own profit incentives and need for self sustainment) really that much superior to what we have now?",

More open access to these services for all. No more a few people picking winners and losers. Increased competition, more choices, and that is good for services and products in this sector.\n\n2. More decentralization means lower risk of the system failing catastrophically like the crises of the current one.\n\n3. Less reliance on trust and more reliance on transparent contracts and open math holds potential for better separation of the good services from the scammy or bad quality ones. This could go some way towards restoring the reputation of the financial sector, which has suffered in the public's estimation because of incessant scams, extortionate practices, intransparency, and causing financial crises bringing hardship predominantly on the middle and lower classes. \n\n4. The technology holds the potential for completely new financial applications and forms of organization that were impractical before programmable money & smart contracts. 'DAO' comes to mind, but really even multi signature contracts which do not rely on trust, but math, are innovative. Being able to exchange value trustlessly through atomic swaps and non-custodial escrow is another.\n\nEDIT: strange, user u/AI_Derp_Learning seems to have removed its account?",

And others disagree with both of us.\n\nI am in crypto for this reason:\n\nI want to take power away from all centralized entities. That is the entire purpose of decentralization.\n\nAnd that is why I support BTC and battle the misconceptions in this subreddit daily.\n\nAll that happened with BCH is that you gave complete power to another centralized entity: /u/memorydealers\n\nhttps://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/1063123138081370112\n\nAnd that is exactly why people who really understood this goal did not want a contentious hardfork for bigger blocks to occur. Once that pandora's box is open, where we let miners have complete control of the network, it can never be reversed. It would mean that no consensus rule in Bitcoin, including the 21m cap, would ever be a certainty.\n\nRoger Ver proudly bragged about being able to force that contentious hardfork with his pool, without any approval from the people pointing their hashrate at BTC in his pool. Instead, he just pointed their BTC hashrate at BCH and paid those miners the difference in the money they would lose by mining BCH for that duration instead of BTC.\n\nWas that november 15 2028 hardfork good or bad? Again, this is subjective, and no single entity should have the power to force a subjective change. \n\nMost users of this sub like to pretend that price is irrelevant, and since hashrate follows price, that hashrate is also therefore irrelevant. \n\nWell, hashrate distribution and % share is literally what keeps bitcoin decentralized. Without BCH's terribly low price and sha-256 hashrate % at that time, Roger would not have been able to force that hardfork by simply flipping a switch on his mining pool.\n\nAnd he had the audacity to brag about doing so....\n\nThe \"people who shouldn't have power to begin with\" that you reference would more easily be able to take complete control of BCH for that same exact reason.\n\nSide point:\n\n>People who want to make as much money as possible.\n\nMoney/capital is literally the path to freedom from control of others in this capitalist world.\n\nMoney is also literally what funded you doing this video. Are you gonna pretend you don't like money?\n\nEdit:\n\nOh and you guys are still bragging about your centralized hardforks: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/uq794u/meme_for_bch_network_upgrade_day/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",
