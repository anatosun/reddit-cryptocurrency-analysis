They include the entrepreneur types, the pragmatists who don't care so much about how it works but rather that it delivers on its promises.\n\nSelf-empowerment might be a bit more appealing way of marketing #2 rather than removing government power, even if ultimately, more power in the hands of the people means less centralized power and maybe that can be equated with \"remove power from governments\".\n\nBut let's keep in mind that people are frequently attached to their government, esp. if the previous government was worse. Ok, so governments right now aren't doing too well _on average_. We need to point out that it's money that often buys a ticket to freedom when government turns oppressive. And when the state or its subservient institutions (like central banks and their regulated downstream commercial banks) start to enforce state ideology, then suddenly the citizen's access to money can become precarious. We saw this in the case of Canada where big banks jumped in to play censors against the truckers who protested against violations of the peoples' rights, freezing peoples' accounts and handing over account details of suspected dissidents to government. This can easily happen anywhere, and cryptocurrencies help protect people against such \"emergency\" situations just as much as they can help in improving regular transacting (if governments / banks weren't putting regulation obstacles in the way all the time).",
