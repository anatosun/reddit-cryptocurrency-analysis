            "selftext": "So guys I am extremely newbie to crypto and I am learning something everyday to widen my knowledge. I am doing my research and looking for forums and threads, also I ordered some books just to get the idea of how the blokchain works, what is staking etc etc. \n\nBut that is a lot of information and I just have a maybe urgent question.   Also, I only plan to HOLD for at least 7-8 years and DCA all the way monthly a couple hundred bucks in but I only plan to buy BTC and ETH currencies.   \n\nLucky me these prices are extremely low these times altough I think that it will take some more patience this time to have another bull run.    \n\nSo I just came across the other day that there will ETH2.0 come out in 2022 June. And some things are just not clear for me. Is it a new currency? Or is it just a huge upgrade for the blokchain itself? \n\nAs a holder, trader, should I transfer my ETH to ETH2.0? Or it will be transferred automatically?   \n\nIn short, my question is:   -Do I need to convert ETH to ETH2?  \n\n(Or it is not a new currency but just a huge upgrade for the blockchain?)  \n\nAlso please give me some ideas where can I get updated always on crypto news (btw I found the thread pretty up to date). \n\nAnd don\u2019t ashame me for my lack of knowledge.   Thank you guys!",

There will probably be another testnet every couple of weeks and Mainnet date will depend on how many issues are found and how long they take to iron out. August is more likely, but there is no set date yet. When it does happen all of your ether, ERC20 tokens, NFTs etc will remain completely unchanged. Nothing needs to be converted, automatically or otherwise.\n\nAn analogy would be that if your wallet is a car, with ether as the fuel, The Merge is about improving the road surface. Your experience driving around might be a little better but nothing about your car or the fuel is changing.",
