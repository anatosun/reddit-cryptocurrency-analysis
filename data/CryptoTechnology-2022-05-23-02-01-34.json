Since this is mostly a technical thread and doesn't have to do with prices I would like your opinion on which you consider the better coin and why.

Which approach is better is hard to say at this point in time.\n\nWith regard to their reputation, both projects had their ups, downs, and criticisms. With some questioning the Polygon's security model (Vitalik). While on Fantom side we had some drama in the past with one of the most popular dev leaving the project and the space in general (Andre).\n\nI hope this helps you get some direction.",

Both are good buys IMO but if you want to 10x, you need to invest in new L1 chains before they get popular, like UTNP and CNDL. CNDL is also a metaverse project, which should pump well later this year when Facebook META launches.",
