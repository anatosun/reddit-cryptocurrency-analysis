The Cash version of bitcoin which can barely operate at a quarter the txn rate, and then replaces an existing on-chain token protocol with a centralized \"side\"-chain solution.

I'm surprised the price hasn't dropped further. We can't even find a single person within every 2 seconds, on the whole planet.\n\nSmartBCH is centralized unless miners are voting. Burning BCH should increase its value, but moving SLP txns off the BCH blockchain could **reduce** its value by more. I prefer centralized exchanges. Atomic swaps would be fun, though, except I don't trust the XMR ones. Ethereum capabilities like USDT were already possible on SLP, but CashTokens should improve that. I never said SmartBCH is a bad thing.\n\nMy account wasn't compromised, but my **mail.com** email was. Their support told me it's de-activated, but I might double-check.",
