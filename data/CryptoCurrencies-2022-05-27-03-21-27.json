Sure, sure, I mean you can make money on anything with volatility. Will anything that isn't bitcoin ever be better than bitcoin at the job of being an asset? Probably not for a long time.\n\nEverything that isn't bitcoin right now is failing to be as simple and as elegant as it could be. It's all extra steps and proprietary or incomplete adoption - the task at hand of a universal commodity is bitcoin. \n\nI wish I had more careful and well articulated points, I have just the sense of urgency of my conviction on the matter.\n\nI am a beginner and I've made many of the beginner mistakes, and one of those is over diversification, and specific to crypto that takes the form of fomo. What if one of these projects really really takes off and I'm left behind? Well, if you want to play roulette play roulette, but the sure thing seems like it's bitcoin.\n\nGod, I'm so frustrated with myself for not being able to outline what has convinced me so, but it is the elegant perfection of what bitcoin is and what it isn't. It isn't more of the same system of money makes power makes law. It isn't its progeny - the bitcoin forks - because it doesn't have to be. It's open, honest, brutal, flow of value.\n\nIt is just enough, no more, no less.",

It's a tad unfortunate thise issues require more complexity, but even today I've always felt BTC is old tech relatively speaking that's being held up by it's cultural status and the vast amount of wealth already invested.",

Saying bitcoin is unsustainable implicitly assumes there is nothing else we can do to not only make room for bitcoin but turn the whole problem around. Namely, we need governments and corporations and the wealthy to get their shit together.\n\nWhen the weather is out of control and water supply is scarce - when the globe is destabilizing because of the consequences of the Anthropocene - it will be because we didn't kill enough rich people and politicians, not because of bitcoin mining.",

I develop an investment strategy first, how much to invest on the long game, how much to use at the casino...errrrr centralized exchange.  Then what sector are you interested in and what will be the next thing.  Metaverse, NFT, blockchains, financial protocols, etc.  Then what do you want your money to do to make you money.  I'm big on passive income, so I want something that I can stake or provide LP so I can gain income in addition to the price going up.  Once I know what I want, I narrow projects down to those parameters and research.  There are a bunch of research sites, I prefer the new guardianplatform.io.  when I find one I like, I buy.  Don't rush, this process for me takes a couple weeks.  Good luck to you!",
