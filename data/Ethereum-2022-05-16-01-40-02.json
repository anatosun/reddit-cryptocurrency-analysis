He doesnt really say anything bad about Ethereum or Vitalik (he says that he disagrees with him on certain issues but he respects him), but he does say Cardano in its future form will have some advantages over current blockchains.\n\nHe says hes pro-choice on which platform devs choose to build on.\n\nI get the feeling that Charles does feel like he and his project are, erm, \"under appreciated\" and that shows up in public interaction. He makes some good points on some of the vitriol in the space but my feeling is that sometimes he contributes to it himself.\n\nI dont think its fair to strike him off before listening to what he says.",
