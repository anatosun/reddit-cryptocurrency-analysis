            "selftext": "Can I use the same wallet with two different wallet softwares? Any risks/cautions about that?\n\nBitPay gave me a hard time getting my ID verification approved, so I used the Mnemonic they generated to import my wallet into Electrum. Worked great and I've already paid for things via Electrum. However, my BitPay balance now shows 0, while Electrum shows the correct remaining balance on one of the change addresses of my wallet.\n\nBitpay's next receive address matches the next unused receive address in Electrum, so I'm confident they're working with the same wallet. But shouldn't Bitpay scan at least the first 20 receive and change addresses from the wallet to discover any balances? Is this just a deficiency of Bitpay, or do all wallets work that way? Is it a bad idea to use the same wallet/master key with two different wallet softwares, even if they're both BIT39-compatable?\n\nNow Bitpay says the resolved the ID verification issue (their support isn't quick, but they do respond). So now I'm mad that I'll have to pay the miners \\~700 SAT for Bitpay to recognize the BTC that's already in what should be the same wallet.",

This is where the thieves trick the phone company into issuing a new SIM for your number & they then use that to reset your password on the exchange, stealing all your Bitcoin.\n\nYou should get a hardware device, like a Yubikey, and use that for the 2FA. Most emails and many other financial institutions support these devices also. Turn it on everywhere. And to be smart, you should have a backup of that key\u2026 so buy two.\n\nI decided to post this today because Yubikey is running a promo today where you can get 2 for the price if one.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t considered Yubikey before, consider it today.\n\nI am not affiliated with Yubikey in anyway. I am just a fan of their products.\n\n\nhttps://www.yubico.com/store/2022/may-the-4th",
