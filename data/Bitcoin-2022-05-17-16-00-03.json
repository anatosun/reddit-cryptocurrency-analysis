Remove the dollar, how much Bitcoin is an apple worth? A banana? Who makes that decision? It's unclear to me how to define it's value without relating it to some other already existing standard. \n\nNote: I have no fuckin idea what I'm talking about and this is probably a stupid question. I'm just curious to see how people that are passionate about crypto might explain this. \n\nThanks :)",

If I'm selling apples for 1 BTC, as long as I'm not the only one selling apples, chances are someone will offer apples for 0.9 BTC. And so on and on until the price for apples, people are willing to pay/sell finds a \"balance\". \n\nI guess you don't even need the \"World without FIAT\" scenario for that to work. \nFIAT is just another number (or system) that represent the \"balanced\" market value for something.

Inflation destroys the assumption that the real value of the unit of account is stable which is the basis of classic accountancy. In such circumstances, historical values registered in accountancy books become heterogeneous amounts measured in different units. The use of such data under traditional accounting methods without previous correction can lead to confusing -- (or even meaningless) -- results.\n\nThere's no perfect way of doing it. Countries usually tend to just use their own currency so the number of the money remains the same, but the price of the products change over time. \n\nWhenever you feel like your cost of living has increased while you acquiring the same stuff as before, you're experiencing this issue.

Presumably, they accept that payment because they can exchange the BTC they receive for whatever currency is actually broadly relevant and usable for them and their business. So the value of that Bitcoin relative to the underlying currency would matter in this case, wouldn't it? Practically speaking, the value of that BTC is defined wholly in the exchange rate between BTC and whatever their native currency is. \n\nIf the world were to switch to BTC as the global currency tomorrow and currencies like the dollar and euro just didn't matter anymore, would 1 BTC still buy you $30K worth of stuff, or would the market have to enter an entirely new phase of price discovery? These exchange rates already exist, so it's difficult for me to imagine that they wouldn't have ANY influence on the new accepted value of BTC if the world were to transition away from fiat. Hence me saying I feel they are coupled. \n\nNot a realistic scenario, obviously. Just something I was thinking about",

By transferring money from fiat to bitcoin now instead of in 10 years I expect/hope that the value of the money has increased compared to if I had kept the money as fiat.

But i explained to my parents how bitcoin works (and just demostrated my understanding of bitcoin and crypto) and agreed i would invest ~\u00a330 to test the waters. I did this because i personally was abit scared as it was my first investment but also to ease them into the thought of buying crypto. Then slowly i continued increasing the amount i invested as i learnt more about the space. Eventually they came to me asking if i could help them put some money in. It would be nice to get their approval but if you are 18, you should invest in what you believe in.",
