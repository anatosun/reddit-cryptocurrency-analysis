I'd have to buy that coin back at whatever price it was at which I might not be able to do. If I can't buy that coin back because I'm broke then there's a big problem. \n\nSee, now someone owns a coin that I never actually had. I borrowed that coin remember? The exchange wants me to buy that coin back so they can give it to the person I borrowed the coin from. Except I can't, because Bitcoin mooned and I literally don't have enough money.\n\nSo what happens now? The person who lent me that coin is shit out of luck. They literally lost a Bitcoin just for having their coins on an exchange. At best they might have salvaged 8% in interest if their exchange pays people to lend bitcoin. \n\nCrazy right? Except in reality thousands if not millions of Bitcoin are short either directly or through derivatives. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that eventually there could be short exposure greater than the maximum supply of Bitcoin. If the price moves up significantly major financial institutions will get liquidated and the people holding coins on exchanges will end up with nothing. \n\nIf this sounds too wild to be true, know that this same kind of shit has happened in the commodity and stock markets. Except when the big shorters start to lose guess what? They just fabricate more shares out of thin air and drive the price down. In some instances the exchange will literally reverse trades to make sure that big shorters don't go bankrupt. Hell the US government has let JPM suppress silver for DECADES, I imagine because it makes the dollar look stronger. \n\nWall street cannot pull this shit with Bitcoin. They can't fabricate more of it (there's only so much they can short it before there is literally no supply left). The exchanges can't reverse trades on the Blockchain. The govt can't do shit either. \n\nTldr: just get your coins off exchange and avoid the inevitable shit show that's going to happen Bitcoin derivatives blow up.",

An exchange can disable withdraws at any point. Say Coinbase has a wallet with 4M bitcoins with customer deposits at 6m bitcoin. If customers try to yank out all 6m at once, all of a sudden they have a big problem trying to get that 2m bitcoins. They can easily disable withdrawals.\n\nThey also can be infinitely leveraged. Say bitcoin goes up 500%. They don't have a margin call or liquidity requirement that says they need to start covering being short 2m bitcoins. No, they can easily start printing more and dumping it at its high price.\n\nLastly, a lot of people can also hedge with leverage derivatives. On paper, they could also be long 2m worth of bitcoin in futures that are for fractions of the cost.\n\nBasically, exchanges always come out on top when you leave your coins with them.",

Once the first major exchange goes bankrupt due to lending, nobody is going to trust an exchange that lends Bitcoin ever again. I don't want or need the govt to come in and \"regulate\" exchanges. Look how shittily wall street is \"regulated\". All these regulations do is make loopholes that allow the powerful to manipulate the market for miniscule fines.\n\nThis isn't the stock market where bad actors like citadel can just short a company into bankruptcy with literally infinite sell pressure via naked shorting. If you're short Bitcoin and it goes to one million a coin you might be able to short it a little bit more but the supply is capped. Shorters will be liquidated and lenders will be lucky to get their coins back.",

I've found the F/G index useful to think about where we are in this place and time, and let it check any impulses or emotions that I might be having. \n\nIf anyone has seen one, please let me know.
