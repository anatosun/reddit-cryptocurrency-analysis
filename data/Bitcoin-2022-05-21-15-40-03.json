How did satoshi have a transaction with 28 bitcoin on it? At this time he had only received rewards in increments of 50 and it would be assumed that if he sent Hal Finney 10 he would have used one of his mining reward transactions to send it and he would have received 40 in return. Is there another transaction on an earlier block that split one of his rewards?",

First, nobody blamed acid rain on the internet. Second, acid rain was resolved because we passed international treaties like the 1985 Helsinki protocol that required countries to pass laws that reduced sulfur emissions. That is the reason why the acid rain problem went away; we stopped emitting sulfur. Just like the Montreal protocol is the reason why the ozone layer has been recovering. These were real problems and we had to do real things to solve them. The fact that we solved those problems doesn't mean that those problems somehow did not exist.",

They can\u2019t legiferate on anything really because whatever EU law is passed by the parliament needs to be received and adopted by countries before entering into force - and that usually takes years. \n\nWhen it comes to taxes, one of the characteristics of the EU is actually tax competition between countries. Germany has recently announced they will not tax crypto if you hold for more than a year. Any attempt of unifying taxes in the EU has miserably failed because that is one of the favorite tools that many EU countries  use to fuck over their neighbors - become de facto tax havens inside the EU (Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg are all examples with their low corporate tax rates). \n\nI hate the EU and I believe the ECB is run by a literal criminal (Lagarde) who has on her shoulder the impoverishment of millions of people from her IMF days.
