How did satoshi have a transaction with 28 bitcoin on it? At this time he had only received rewards in increments of 50 and it would be assumed that if he sent Hal Finney 10 he would have used one of his mining reward transactions to send it and he would have received 40 in return. Is there another transaction on an earlier block that split one of his rewards?",
