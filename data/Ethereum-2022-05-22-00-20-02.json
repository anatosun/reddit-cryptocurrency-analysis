I already knew this, but psychologically I only came to understand the scale when I saw them lined up together, collection after collection, sold as \"unique\" items.\n\nOne cool use I see would be custom festival tickets for example, as it doesn't really cost that much more to the organizers of events to make these instead of paper ones, and it adds some uniqueness to them.\n\nThe problem I see in this system is that the bandwidth is shared between all actions on the blockchain, be it an important eth transaction or a monkey jpeg. Imo there should be different \"lanes\" for applications of different domains, like one lane for finance, one for nfts, and so on.\n\nThat being said, I am also surprised by how low the fees are.",
