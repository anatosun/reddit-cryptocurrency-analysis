If you don\u2018t want to do that, you\u2018d have to trust someone, who did that for you (i.e. some electrum server)\n\n[https://electrumx-spesmilo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol.html](https://electrumx-spesmilo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol.html)  \n\n\nIn fact how much you can trust any ownership, is a function of time. If an incoming transaction is buried deep down in the blockchain (i.e. 6 blocks in the past), it is much more trusted than a transaction, that is just in the mempool or confirmed only once. So there is no 100% ultimate, but confirmed 6 blocks in the past is about 99.99999999% ultimate.",
