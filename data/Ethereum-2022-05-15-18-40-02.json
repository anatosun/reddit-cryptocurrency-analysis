US gets nothing.\n\nLook at what Tom Duffy and  the CME are doing to our industry, this decrepit guy is admitting to the US ag hearing what he & his crony did the last 4 year to us. If they try to give licenses to DeFi w/ gate keeping, Dedollarize everything, let them know.\n\nYou know how easy it is to just write a front end that shows the usd dollar amount of a completely different stable coin pegged to god knows what. Dedollarization.\n\nJust build collateralized stable coins tied to a basket of 50 different currencies and 20 or 30 treasuries, plus 20 or 30 commodities, if these nation state want to do reflexivity attacks on the collateral, they'll have to short every major currency in every major country in the world. Invent our own peg. Over collateralize it to peg it to a past snap shot of itself at a given index of valued assets. It can be done.",
