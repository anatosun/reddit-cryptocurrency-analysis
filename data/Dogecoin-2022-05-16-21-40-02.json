Stuff like secure hardware /android stronbox and secure enclave  on iphones amongst other things. The wallet needs to support these features though.  If it does, your keys are isolated and offline even if you connect the phone to the internet. (but signing the blockchain transaction is online I think )\n\nNot sure if MyDoge supports these. Also  it is closed source which is a negative.\n\nIf mydoge was open source and uses these features + run on a device that still gets security updates and also has the necessary secure hardware , mass storage is also fine. But a hardware wallet still offers better peace of mind.",
