I think that would be a lovely collaboration.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin number one.  Dogecoin, come on, it deserves to be number three... Or number two!  And then Ethereum, whatever that other number is.\"",

It's just arbitrage which is cover for all sorts of misdirection. But granted that it tends to happen each become retethered but at different levels.

They were a tethered arbitrage pair.\n\nBy driving down LTC while doge is held steady 2 percent, the natural rebound after the bots tether and attempt to arbitrage from doge again causes a rebound pressure of 2 percent back up.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/6VTBYoy\n\nWhen you drive a commodity down extremely sharply you can pretty much bet on it rebounding, and the bots take care of the rest.\n\nKnowing doge as noted was being arbitrage tethered to LTC, a sharp drop in LTC while doge held steady leads to a recovery boost in both LTC AND DOGE granted that we knew LTC was already an arbitraged tethered pair with DOGE.\n\nThats why early on we mentioned that it was key to monitor flow data and find these relationships. These relationships can be exploited.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/6VTBYoy\n\nThe continuity of this thread documents the process.",

Last time we boosted doge to cause a reversal Elon's tweet was attributed to being the cause although it came at a completely arbitrary time literally more than 12 hours after we had already began the reversal.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/TFF1ZRp\n\nTossing money in to the pot is a typical gesture and more symbolic than anything. The amount thrown in was just my own money and any profits would be divided to the team which barely pays for the rock stars and pizza. Lol\n\nI'm not certain if it was just a badly timed tweet and if Flon deliberately stole credit... Which is pretty characteristic of how he operates. It is however common for adbots which are really the same as news bots these days as mass com(rades) know we live on the age of the vanishing ad ie everything is an ad. And news and ads have become one in the same. Adbots are triggered by rises of any commodity to draw attention to cause people to buy late in the game. We had signaled the beginning of the reversal while his tweet was already 12 hours after the rise had already occurred so anyone who believed Elon caused the rise of they were only notified and truly believed it was because of his tweet would be buying 60 percent higher than if they had bought when the reversal had already began turning it into a pump and dump by virtue of people believing Flon was the cause of the rise and buying way too late after the price had already risen thus buying high.\n\nBe real here... If we had claimed at 2pm we caused the reversal rather than at 530am no one would take us seriously. Why would Flon be treated as if his tweet made any difference at all other than MAYBE contributing to doge after his very late tweet becoming a pump and dump to top off the reversal we began literally minutes after announcement at 530 am.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/yF0hbcu.jpeg\n\nAt 530 when we began the reversal there was no clear indication there would be a reversal at all. At 2pm you're literally just pointing 12 hours later at a reversal and claiming you did it if he in fact claims his tweet caused the reversal. Why would anyone beleive his tweets do anything when it's so clearly frivolous. \n\n\nThis is what makes all this complicated because this can bite doge later unfortunately due to the concurrent doge = Elon's Ego campaign I'm deliberately trying to distance myself from.\n\nIf Elon keeps pretending he is the \"doge father\" just like he pretends he's the tesla father or the PayPal father etc doge will be blighted by his reputation.\n\nDoge should be neutral and not considered tethered to any papacy nevermind some tech daddy wannabe.\n\nI'll chalk it up to a mistake and maybe Flon had no clue his tweet would be cited by newsbots as a fake catalyst so Ill withhold judgment. Others however might not which leaves doge on the cross hairs between anonymous and musk.\n\nNot a good place.",

Market analysis IS stupid. Charts are not scientific they are just meant to be framed to represent anything you want like looking for patterns in toast. No one uses charts to prove anything scientifically charts are arguments used to selectively market data. That's why I keep it simple and use wysiwyg charts that can't be zoomed or scaled. At best in science they're visual aids that's it. Never has a scientist pulled out a chart and said hey causality. The times it's been used that way surprise surpise are typically eugenics type crap like the infamous bell curve theory whose citations are basically a pile of disconnected data used as sand upon which the theory is built or economics which we as a species really suck at. \n\nTrying to guess at a pattern based on squiggles whose granularity is completely arbitrary based on zooming scaling stretching and smoothening of infinitely granular data based pretty much on human emotion and bots also trying to simulate and \"guess\" human emotion is nonsense. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/cTYR8Z4\n\nSo just play along. Half of all this is social engineering.\n\nWhen you are inducing an effect you can track the progress and see that LTC is basically being dragged along by doge at this point as it's still trying to recover from the sudden drop.",
