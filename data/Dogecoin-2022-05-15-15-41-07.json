If they want to just take zkRollup-style technology and just have thousands of transactions\u00a0a second on their own chain, that would be a great outcome as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce Ethereum gets its scalability, any scalability thing that works for Ethereum as such that you would be able to also trade Doge with extremely low transaction fees and very high speed as well.\"\n\n\"If doge wants to make a fork to allow two way transferability with Ethereum, they could.  I think that would be a lovely collaboration.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin number one.  Dogecoin, come on, it deserves to be number three... Or number two!  And then Ethereum, whatever that other number is.\"",
