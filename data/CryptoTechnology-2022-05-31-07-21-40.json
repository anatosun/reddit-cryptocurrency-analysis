For instance, If I wanted to sell an NFT but wouldnt mind it being sold either over ethereum or hedera, can I have the token exist on both networks, and then moved around on either one based on which platforms it sells in? Im developing an NFT storage platform, and Im just trying to grasp all possibilities.",

You could also take a centralized approach in which any burn, mint, or transfer between networks requires your signature. In that case you would query the state of the token on each of the networks before you sign.",
