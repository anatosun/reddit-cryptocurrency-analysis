            "selftext": "Do Kwon, the CEO of Terralabs, the company that created the terra blockchain, UST, and Luna, believes he has a solution. He recently proposed a Terra blockchain hardfork, which requires creating a new copy of the network with significant upgrades. The new blockchain will be absent of the algorithmic stablecoin and will feature a billion Luna tokens, which will be issued to current Luna and UST holders and used to encourage the development of new Terra apps. Do you even know what's the difference between algorithmic and non-algorithmic stablecoins? I'll link it [here](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/algorithmic-stablecoins-what-they-are-and-how-they-can-go-terribly-wrong/). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey lost a lot of money in the crisis, which exposed the weakness of various cryptocurrencies and algorithmic stablecoins. Although the proposed approach may help Terra, many investors are already doubting the credibility of other stablecoins. They still have a long way to go before garnering the trust of the public. Do you think this could be the end of stablecoins? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther algorithmic stablecoin initiatives may have learned something from the disaster. Other initiatives are taking precautions to avoid ending up in the same situation as Terra. The Tron DAO Reserve, for example, increased its reserves by purchasing millions in TRX, Bitcoin, and Tether to defend USDD, its stablecoin. Is it the time for exchanging your stablecoins for other currencies like ETH, BTC, etc? ETH can always be used for NFTs from communities like BAYC, High Sloth Society, etc. so it seems like a good option. BTC on the other hand is the currency that keeps driving the whole market with it, and as we all know, the king of crypto. With that in mind, people will split on these two and probably number of other options as well. Do you believe in stablecoins, or will you switch to other currencies considering the situation?",
