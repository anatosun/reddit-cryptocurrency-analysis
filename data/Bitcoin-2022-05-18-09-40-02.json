                    "response": "I'm going to take a moment to talk about NFTs since I see people in here talking and arguing about them. NFTs have some actual use cases, but what people are currently doing with them on altcoin platforms is not one of them.\n\nBelow I will explain how the NFTs on altcoin platforms work on a technical level and I will explain why they probably wont even exist in 10 years. I will also explain why some of these NFTs are selling for such high prices.\n\nMany of those NFTs that were sold for crazy high prices were not actually sold to other people. The person who bought those expensive NFTs is often the same person who minted the NFT in the first place. I will explain how whales can easily own very expensive rare NFTs for very little cost. They can just mint an NFT and sell it to them self for $500,000 worth of et\u04bb. They will only lose the small percentage that the NFT marketplace takes and now they own a super rare NFT worth $500k and they will still have most of their et\u04bb because they sold the NFT to them self. And there is a small chance that they might be able to to sell that worthless NFT to some fool who believes that it is actually valuable. Doing this also entices more newbies to mint NFTs in the hopes of getting rich.\n\nSome people are now using flash loans to borrow large amounts of et\u04bb so that they can purchase their own NFTs for extremely high prices and then they pay back the flash loan all in the same block. https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/122516/how-a-cunning-trick-made-it-look-like-a-cryptopunk-sold-for-532-million\n\nHere is another example that can be done. You can mint an NFT and sell it to yourself for $1000, then put it up for sale and buy it from yourself again for $1500, and sell it to yourself another time for $2200. Now you can put this appreciating NFT up for sale and try to sell it to some fool who sees it keeps getting sold for more and thinks that it must be valuable.\n\nHave you seen celebrities buying NFTs like jpegs of bored apes for hundreds of thousands of dollars? Platforms like MoonPay are paying those celebrities to claim that they bought those NFTs. Those celebrities didn't really pay anything for those NFTs. Those celebrities actually got paid for receiving those NFTs. You can often look at the blockchain and see that the et\u04bb that was used to buy the NFT came directly from a platform like MoonPay, as is the case with the bored ape NFTs that Post Malone recently \"bought for $700k+\"\n\nThe current NFTs are useful for something. These NFTs are a useful tool for laundering illegally acquired cryptocurrency. Criminals can shift around their ill gotten crypto between different tokens, mint an NFT, and purchase their own NFT with their dirty crypto. Now they've cleaned their dirty crypto and they also own a rare NFT that's supposedly worth a lot of money. I mean just look at how much it sold for!\n\nIt costs anywhere from $100-$600+ to mint an NFT on et\u04bbereum depending on the current gas fees and where you mint it. So they're [hyping shitcoiners/artists/anyone up and luring them into minting crap in the hopes of getting rich](https://fstoppers.com/opinion/nfts-are-pyramid-scheme-and-people-are-already-losing-money-554869) and NFTs are doing a great job of that at the moment. People are spending millions of dollars worth of et\u04bbereum minting NFTs hoping to hit the NFT lottery and get rich.\n\n**All these NFT tokens being sold on et\u04bbereum right now either point to a URL on the internet, or an IPFS hash. In most circumstances they reference an IPFS gateway on the internet run by the same startup that sold the NFT. That URL also isn't the media. That URL is a JSON metadata file.** The owners of the servers have no obligation to continue storing the media. Now let's take a look at a couple of real NFTs and see how they work on a technical level.\n\nhttps://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x12f28e2106ce8fd8464885b80ea865e98b465149/1\n\nThis NFT token is for this JSON file hosted directly on Nifty's servers as shown below: https://api.niftygateway.com/beeple/100010001/\n\nThat file refers to the actual media that was \"bought.\" Which in this case is hosted by Cloudinary CDN, which is served by Nifty's servers again. So if Nifty goes bust, this token is now worthless. It refers to nothing and this can't be changed. \n\nNow we'll take a look at the $69,346,250 Beeple, sold by Christies. It's so expensive. Surely it isn't centralized, right? Wrong, it's pointless: https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924\n\nThat NFT token refers directly to an IPFS hash. We can take that IPFS hash and fetch the JSON metadata using a public gateway: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz\n\nSo well done for referring to IPFS, it references the specific file rather than a URL that might break! **But** the metadata links to: https://ipfsgateway.makersplace.com/ipfs/QmXkxpwAHCtDXbbZHUwqtFucG1RMS6T87vi1CdvadfL7qA\n\nThis is an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com, the same NFT minting startup which will go bust one day.\n\nYou might say \"*just refer to the IPFS hash in both places!*\" But IPFS only serves files as long as a node in the IPFS network **intentionally** keeps hosting it. Which means when the startup who sold you the NFT goes bust, the files will probably vanish from IPFS too. [This is already happening.](https://twitter.com/CheckMyNFT/status/1371960028765245440) There are already [NFTs with IPFS resources that are no longer hosted anywhere.](https://twitter.com/scanlime/status/1371509988179464196)\n\nAnd just pinning the file on your own IPFS node also wont work because the metadata file generally points to a specific HTTP IPFS gateway URL and not the IPFS hash. This means that when the gateway operator goes bust, I can buy the domain and start serving dick pics lol\n\nRight now NFT's are built on an absolute house of cards constructed by the people selling them, and it is likely that every NFT sold on et\u04bbereum so far will be broken within a decade. This creates a pretty solid exit plan for makersplace if they run into financial problems. The people who own the these useless NFTs \"worth\" millions of dollars are going to be pretty motivated to buy the site or fund it. Or someone can buy the bankrupt startup domains and start charging NFT owners to serve their files.",

Before minting pictures of monkeys wearing different hats became the NFT fad, NFTs were talked about as being rare/limited items in video games. For example, some RPG with random drops might have some special sword that only has 10 copies possible. Someone who finds that sword could sell it or even rent it to other players. This type of monetization has potential because there's already a huge market for paying people to level up characters or grind for rare items.",

Maybe you take a 0 Mana sword into a game where that number is read as weapon condition so the new game assumes your weapon is broken.\n\nBasically these items only make sense in the context of the games that they were designed for and, unless a herculean effort was made to standardize game engines, switching them between games seems pretty unlikely.",

I can't bring a sword from Diablo over into WOW as an example.  The companies that own these ecosystems have 100% control over every item in their game.  They don't need NFT's to already say, \"there's only 10 copies of this sword in the game, that's why they're $5,000 each\".  How would you see NFT's enabling what they can already do without the extra cost/hassle of the minting process?\n\nEdit:  I thought of one:  VG Publishers would love to make games 'pay to win' where you can buy a higher powered whatever for real dollars, but the gaming community slaughters companies when they try to do this.  So, the publisher could mint NFT items with higher power, and limit their drop rate in the game to a scarce number.  Then they wouldd enable in-game trading and if based on the NFT, the publisher could get royalties every time that item changes hands.  When the gaming community screams \"pay to win!\" the publisher can say, \"hey, it's not us charging money, it's your fellow players!  You had the same chance at getting that drop as the guy who got it!\"",

See it as it was a key because that is the way it has to be seen.\n\nNFTs are keys that open doors, either access to a DAO, either access some services, you can stake them to access rewards or private sales for some other content. There is a truck load of things yet to discover. \n\nAlso, NFTs are a new way for companies to start businesses owning their own liquidity and having each NFT holder as a shareholder in that company.\n\nSo obviously some clever people are using NFTs to do some arbitrage and crazy stuff to evade taxes or to lure some dudes but it is absolutely not the core of what an NFT is used for. It is not deviant at all, people that use it badly are the deviant ones. \n\nThis technology is here to stay weather you want it or not. Face it bro",

TF2 still exists today and is nowhere near as popular as Fortnite is right now.\n\nPeople don't migrate to a company because they like the idea of buying/selling/trading skins, they play a game because they like the game.\n\nYour comment sounds awfully libertarian and this fake idea that humans will naturally reward companies that do good things, and punish those that don't.

Game developers do not have an incentive to do this because they want users to buy new items every time they make a new game. They have zero financial incentive to do this, and NFTs wouldn't be the way even if they did.\n\n>Considering games are usually developed on a similar engine with publishers it would be easy for them to make this happen as the data could easy be interpreted between generations.\n\nNo, it wouldn't. The only way to make this work is to not only develop all the games in the same engine, but also standardize all animations / models / cosmetics / items across the entire ecosystem. It also means whatever design decisions are made when this is implemented are permanent; changing them will break your in game item. So now whatever developer decides to do this is stuck with that system, forever. Major changes and innovation are now more difficult. \n\n> As for the NFT being trustworthy, having a long standing institution/company such as Ubisoft backing it feels better than an alt-coin which only appeared a year or two ago.\n\nHaving your purchase backed by a central authority defeats the entire purpose of purchasing anything backed by a blockchain. Either it's an NFT, or it's backed by Ubisoft, doing both makes zero sense.",

The government enforces contracts. Thats what makes them legit. Who enforces nft's? \n\nIf i buy a house and upload a copy online somewhere. Lets say someone makes an nft of the contract. Would the house then be his or hers? Would  the contract not be mine anymore? And again who would enforce the legitimacy of an nft? And why should anyone care what some online proof of ownership says?",
