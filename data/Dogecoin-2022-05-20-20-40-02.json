RH needs to scan your drivers license, you need to download an Authenticator App, you need to confirm your email. \n\nThen when it\u2019s all setup, you can send doge to your mydoge wallet. You can do this by going to your doge investment in RH, scroll down and click send. That\u2019s when you paste your MyDoge coin wallet address. You can get the address by click on the paw, and \u201creceive coin\u201d from the menu. It will give you an option  to copy the address of the wallet. \n\nWhen you are in RH, after you click send you just click \u201center manually\u201d that\u2019s when you paste the address.",
