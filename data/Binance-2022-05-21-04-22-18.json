When I was taking him through the steps, binance had a \"special offer\" of 20% for the first 2k BUSD, the APY was doubled for every tier.\n\nI checked my own app and it still said only 10%\n\nWhat gives? What do u need to do to see the special offer rate? He's had his binance account for over a year like me.",

Every time it's done that in the past it's made its way to the 200 week moving average, which currently sits at $21,800 USD or there abouts.\n\nRising inflation, a parabolic USD, the us fed slapping down interest rate hikes a fortnight ago and another 50 basis points expected soon should push btc price further down, causing it to hit that 200w MA sooner rather than later.. Hell it could even go down to the 300w MA.. But we'll cross that bridge when we get there..\n\nSo there is almost certainly a market bottom on the horizon, I for one don't believe that 26k was the bottom for btc.",
