First there haven\u2019t been 21 million BTC mined yet and your going to be waiting more than a couple decades for the rest to be mined. Even if there were that many coins. There are quite a few people waiting, for 21 million other rich people to try to rush the supply. It\u2019s called decentralization, this would only empower BTC, no one entity is going to be taking control of BTC. Honestly the only possibility of stopping BTC is if BTC self-destructs via miners direction.",
