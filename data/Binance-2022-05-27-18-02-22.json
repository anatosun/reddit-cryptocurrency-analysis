In the crypto space, the major crypto platform and the department will collaborate. \n\nThe memorandum was signed during Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao's visit to the Central Asian country, according to the crypto news outlet Forklog, which cited the company. Zhao met with top government officials in Kazakhstan, including the head of the digital development ministry, Bagdat Musin, and President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. \n\nAccording to the report, Binance will advise the country on cryptocurrency regulation. The Ministry of Digital Transformation and the exchange will also look for a solution that will allow Kazakhstan's banking infrastructure to be integrated with the cryptocurrency market, the document details.\n\nFurthermore, Binance and the Ministry of Finance have agreed to collaborate in support of the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC), the financial hub in Nur-Sultan, formerly Astana. The two parties have discussed the creation of a blockchain-focused venture fund and an academy \"to help local talent from the Astana Hub reach the global level,\" according to Musin. \n\nKazakhstan wishes for AIFC to serve as a hub for regulated cryptocurrency exchanges. As part of a pilot project, the country's National Association of Blockchain and Data Center Industry announced last summer that domestic commercial banks will be allowed to open accounts for crypto trading platforms registered at the hub. \n\nKazakhstan became a major mining hotspot after China cracked down on its crypto mining industry last spring, but the influx of miners has been blamed for a growing power deficit.\n\nTo address the issue, the government intends to implement differentiated tax rates based on the cost of consumed electrical energy. The necessary changes to the Tax Code were approved on first reading in the Mazhilis, the lower house of parliament, this week.",

Since then, it has been bolstering its compliance team by recruiting from the ranks of former regulators.\nIt has also increased its presence in the Middle East. It was granted a restricted operating license in Dubai in March and temporary authorisation to operate as a broker dealer in Abu Dhabi, the UAE's capital, in April.\n\nIn my opinion Binance's increased regulatory compliance is great for the mainstream adoption of Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. \nA regulatory compliance that acknowledges operations of the biggest crypto exchange platform in the world will increase cryptocurrecy use in a country. Regulations creates trust with the crypto centric platforms and government institutions who in turn would facilitate cryptocurrency use, trust is also created between users and platforms as the regulations serve to protect rights of users. \nAlso regulations would grant investors both retail and institutional confidence to invest the crypto and blockchain ecosystem. \n\n\nThe blockchain ecosystem is  growing by facilitating the development of innovative projects that could reshape industries and even create new markets. \nThe innovation of the developing ecosystem is embodied by projects such as Silks a blockchain-based metaverse that enables users to own, trade, and profit from thoroughbred racing horses, Shiryo is a P2E Card trading game in the metaverse that allows users to hold their cards as NFTsbased on the Ethereum network, Sandbox is like the metaverse-equivalent of MineCraft in terms of its design and functionality. It like a real estate on the metaverse, Decentraland  an online world that allows users to create their own avatars and purchase plots of virtual land. I think that as blockchain technology becomes more mainstream.\n\nHowever while regulations are good for the increased adoption they might stifle innovation and technological development with stringent rules and act to centralize the crypto ecosystem.\nI think it is an irony that Bitcoin and it's alternatives which were designed to be decentralized protocols have to be subject to centralized authorities in order to thrive. \n\n\nNews Source: \nhttps://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/26/binances-bahrain-license-upgraded-for-more-crypto-services/",
