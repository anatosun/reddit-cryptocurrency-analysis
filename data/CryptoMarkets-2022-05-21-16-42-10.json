Mostly because they're a great way to bring some privacy features to eth.\n\nHowever, zkp is not enough to get full smart contract functionality + privacy (that is, the ability to have encrypted inputs, outputs, and state for smart contract transactions).  Unfortunately, only fhe would get us there and it's currently orders of magnitude too slow.  The alternative is to use hardware solution instead of cryptographic.  Scrt uses hardware approach but they've always said they will switch to fhe the moment a sufficiently efficient fhe protocol is invented (but this is a hard-core math problem, it's unsoved as yet).\n\nI did look into oasis a few months ago but they didn't have private smart contracts on mainnet yet at the time. I do think they had something for like private transfers or something but that doesn't rly excite me since I'm kind of an xmr maxi for transactional privacy.  Do you know if oasis is now with fully private smart contracts?",
