A better service would be to replace them by a decentralized third-party.\n\nAnd actually, it's exactly what blockchains do: miners are a decentralized third-party handling the cost of computation and competing against each others so that the cheapest ones are favored over the more expensive ones, to the point market prices are closer to cost.

The drivers can still choose their own price to give the ride, but the 15% fee that the Uber execs get is replaced with a transaction cost. Eth transaction costs go down in the long term but Uber has no incentive to reduce their costs. So basically drivers can make more and people getting rides can pay less. \n\nIf you want to get really fancy, you can control the entire system with its own token, released on the ethereum network. This means that the USD price can be the same as before, but drivers are essentially paid in stock. The drivers could sell this stock for USD immediately, or they can hold it if they believe more people will use the system in the future. Riders, drivers, and investors can all benefit from increased use of the Blockchain version of Uber. Unlike the current Uber, where drivers make peanuts and the execs are billionaires. \n\nReduced costs and better incentives than real Uber.\n\nAlso, your comment basically assumes that ether price wont go up more and that everyone who will profit has already profited, which I don't think is true.",

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think people get confused since most see Ethereum as just a currency. I'm sure some people think it's literally just another Bitcoin. But in reality it's a network of nodes that can operate and execute smart contracts and the currency or \"fees\" is actually Ether. And Ether or \"fees\" are the incentive for people to get involved and exchange those contracts between other users (Gas).\n\nPeople also ask how is the guy supposed to get an Uber or how am I supposed to find the Rubix cube seller. On Ethereum you can run decentralized apps or dApps as well that could bring the two parties together.  I believe there's even insurance applications that have emerged.  \n\nI imagine many people back before internet also said many of the same things like \"Well how are we gonna do this?\" or \"How is this going to work then?\"",

The difference between paying Ethereum and paying eBay/PayPal/uber is that in an Ethereum contract you can completely eliminate service fees and replace them with transaction fees. Ethereum has scaling plans which will, in a few years, increase between 100x and 1000x the capacity, which should translate into an equivalent reduction in transaction fees. There\u2019s also layer 2 solutions in the work, which allow scaling beyond this but at different costs (this gets really technical quick, but all solutions have different sacrifices made)",

Eth replaced all of those business costs with \"ethereum stalkers\", or people who maintain the ethereum network in exchange for getting paid in inflation. There is no profit / loss statement for ethereum itself, just an inflation rate and a burn rate (a small amount of eth is destroyed on each exchange, acting somewhat like a stock buyback and returning some money to investors). \n\nThe cost has a few benefits in itself. #1 it provides incentives for the stakers (workers for the eth network) to maintain the network. #2 secures the network, since to hack the Blockchain you need 51% of the money, #3 stops people from spamming the network like they do on the normal internet, since spam would cost them money, #4 properly aligns incentives between users and the workers and the investors for the eth network. You are the product on services like google / twitter / Facebook, so those companies incentives are to get as many users as possible and then slowly screw them over with more ads and stuff. \n\nYou gotta think of eth as digital oil. Essentially you burn oil to run your car, oil itself is a commodity where anyone could buy some oil and create a product or usecase with it. Ethereum is a digital commodity where anyone can buy it and use it to create their own product or usecase around it. \n\nNot sure if this helps but it's how I think about it",

You can use smart contracts on Ethereum without involving any currency payment in either direction.  In fact, when some payment is involved in the contract, it doesn\u2019t even have to be Ether.

Sure the large, complicated protocols need a lot of work to get going, that's why they launch tokens, fund their work, then decentralize. Look at Maker for example. There is no real company actively maintaining it now, all the decisions are made through governance by the token holders.

It's refactoring to pave the way for future expansions. Sure, if you have a dead simple app that never changes or offers new features, your maintenance costs will be very low.

They are constantly refining the user experience, adjusting to changing regulatory frameworks across dozens of  countries and languages, etc. Uber wouldn't be spending millions every month on software developers if they didn't need to.\n\nMaker, and DeFi in general, is dead simple and cannot be compared to a consumer service like Uber.

How do you know rates are fair for instance? Blockchain could help with both these instances",

We have it nice because people are generally well off and trust is not an issue - no one is trying to screw anyone over continuously and the status quo is to be honest and generally fair, i.e. trust is built into the culture. Take for example my home country - Ukraine. It's a 2nd world country, we had multiple bank failures in 10 years (90s and 2000s), multiple currencies in 10 years (the 90s), jailed politicians, and an overall corrupt financial system. No one trust anybody - not banks, not other people. For that reason lending it still not really a thing there, you either have the cash or not. Credit cards are starting to appear now but it's still uncommon. Most people use debit cards linked directly to their bank. So while for you it seems pointless, you have to look outside of your immediate scope. Etherium can, and to some extent already does solve the aforementioned issues- trustless lending, credit, investment, etc. And Ukraine isn't even that bad, its not 3rd world. There are countries where currencies regularly inflate 1000s of % and the governments just exist for the sake of corruption. Those people can't even start dreaming about a reliable bank account, let alone Amazon or eBay. And as unstable as ether may seem, its a whole lot better than some of those fiats. The 1st world doesn't need what ETH has to offer, but I believe that the rest of the world could use some of what we have.",

                    "response": "There are two main unsolved problems around deterministic (smart is the wrong word to use) contracts:\n\n**First, you can't have both trustless execution and ability to intervene in case of a bug.**\n\nYou either create a smart contract which executes no matter what after it's been deployed and nobody has the ability to change it. As a participant you can trust it will do what the code says that it will do. The problem here is that if the contract is complex, you can't verify the code yourself with high confidence, especially if you don't know programming.\n\nEven if you have code that is mathematically provably correct and has no bugs, the real world changes and the contract may become obsolete in the new real world conditions. Bugs or real world changes may mean that the inability to change the contract can create a situation where the contract is harmful and in a big way. This happened in Ethereum contracts many times. The biggest blunder was the DAO, where a bug allowed an attacker syphon out insane amounts of funds from people's accounts. This attack forced the Ethereum community to fork the code leaving the unforked original chain as Ethereum Classic, and the forked one became Ethereum. This is a hugely disruptive event, and you can't keep forking every time. It's unsustainable.\n\nThe other option is that you leave a publicly known backdoor for a few trusted developers who can change the contract in case there is a bug or other urgent need to change the code. However, the more developers have keys to make such a code the less you can trust the contract. The less people have the keys the bigger the chance the keys are lost and the contract becomes like the first scenario. Also, the whole point of deterministic contracts is that you don't need to trust anyone. If you have to trust some people you may not even know personally, people who may have changing motivations and circumstances you may as well just run a mysql database much more efficiently and cheaply to run the same application. No need for \"smart\" contracts.\n\n**Second, you can't tie contracts to real world events efficiently and trustlessly.**\n\nFor example, how do you verify that the toy was sent and received and thus the payment to the vendor can be released? You have to rely on the post office or the buyer to verify that manually within the contract, which means the vendor relies on third parties. The deterministic contract can still help the process, the dependence on an oracle (somebody who can tell you real world events happened) is still a significant issue.\n\nThis is why \"tokenize the world\" is frankly mostly vaporware. You can't trust a tokenized banana to verify its origin, because you need to trust every participant in the supply chain that they will not cheat by replacing the original fair trade banana with another random one. And if you trust every participant, you can just run a regular database yet again. No blockchain needed.\n\nI know there are projects that are attempting to solve the oracle issue, but it's not there yet. We need a breakthrough idea to resolve it, and it may not even be a computer science problem.\n\nWhat you CAN do now is create contracts that depend on events that are not tied to real world events like the delivery of a toy, instead depend on things that are easy to check with high confidence right on the blockchain without an oracle. For example you can tie a contract to a block height (effectively timed), or a certain amount of funds on a specific account. It's limited, but still useful.\n\nFor example, you can make a contract that automates retirement funds. You pay funds to an account for many years (which may get staked) and at the end of the contract you will start receiving funds back until the funds run out. Or you can do a lottery where everybody pays in to a contract a small amount and only one person wins based on an unpredictable number like the hash of a block in a future time.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nIt's important to note that contracts tied to blockchain events are not new. Bitcoin had it from the very beginning. And with the upcoming taproot upgrade such complex contracts will become more efficient and confidential. Both options have benefits and both communities have taken ideas from each other. It's a mutually beneficial ecosystem. Bitcoin and Ethereum are in a healthy competition, like two training partners both training for the Olympics, where they have to face the worldwide economy.\n\nUltimately, blockchains have one significant use case so far: **store of value that is resistant to any censorship from any authority (digital gold).** This is what Bitcoin is optimizing for successfully so far. We will see in another 5 years if Ethereum can do it too. (One has to be careful not to be overly optimistic in a bull market.)\n\nA secondary important use case is **cheap, scalable and trustless transfer for of value (payments)**, which is what the Bitcoin Lightning Network is optimizing for, somewhat successfully so far. However it's way too early to tell. L2 solutions similar to LN also started to appear within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAll the other use cases, like Time stamping, Tokens, DeFi, NFTs, etc. are all exciting and fun, but uncomparable in significance to the digital gold and payments use cases. This is especially true that these secondary use cases typically suffer from the above two problems.\n\nThe hard truth is that all the alternative use cases are basically just marketing talking points for most coins, and not much beyond. Most coins are mostly just used for gambling in a giant worldwide casino. Gambling is big business and this is just the beginning of a huge change in the world, so not putting anything down, but it's important to be cognisant of this reality.",

Person A has a million dollars to buy a house.\n\n2. Person B is selling their house for 1 million dollars.\n\n3. The smart contract conditions are distributed across the blockchain, and state IF person A pays 1 million, THEN they receive person B\u2019s house. \n\n4. Person A sends 1 million to the smart contract. \n\n4. Person B signs ownership to person B in the smart contract.\n\n5. The smart contract determines if person A and person B\u2019s conditions are met, if yes, the transaction completion is written to the blockchain. Person A received a house and person B receives the money.\n\n6. If the smart contract conditions are not met (usually with a time limit), the 1 million dollars are returned to person A.\n\nPerson A should have trust in the blockchain and smart contract, because if the conditions are not met the money is still technically theirs according to the public ledger.",

Good luck setting up your own taxi service, advertising and gaining a customer base that will cost less than the fees Uber takes.\n\nThe eBay example: Ok the selling sells you the Rubik's cube for $20. eBay takes $3 leaving you with $17. Again, they are providing the platform to sell that Rubik's cube. Good luck stumbling across someone who at the time of selling said Rubik's cube wants to buy one. Next, what happened if the Rubik's cube is faulty? The contract has been completed, you can't reverse the transaction now. The fees over you and the seller to protect both of you.\n\nThese examples actually make Ethereum look BAD.

Uber has a network to coordinate drivers. I don\u2019t understand the follow through with OP\u2019s post, although maybe I\u2019m jist not understanding the concepts.\n\nTo me smart contracts are going to first affect larger financial and contractual obligations, ones where a bank must be present, or a lawyer paid for to just sit and witness. Maybe settling financial obligations while overseas or across the country, or making an agreement that doesn\u2019t have to sit on someone\u2019s ledger like Fanny Mae, only for them to use it as collateral for other market making. I still can\u2019t comprehend the full scale utilization of smart contracts on block chain as revolutionary, but as I begin to learn more about the nuances, I think it\u2019s important to bring people up to the level of comprehension of larger financial instruments rather than try to discuss things like Uber when the real world implementation still doesn\u2019t sit with my brain.\n\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong or off base, I still love learning about blockchain and I\u2019m invested in some, but it\u2019s going to take more than a tik tok style video to get these concepts across.",

How can you replace uber or ebay as centralized facilitators of a transaction in which a good or service was exchanged with a smart contract? That's still unclear.\n\nI think the answer to this is as follows:  \nYou can build a smart contract in which a person requesting a ride pays for the ride to the contract. The contract has inputs to listen to the status of the ride being given. When the ride is concluded, it triggers the contract to pay the driver. In this case, there is no centralized authority but there is a need for some datasource that informs the contract when to transfer eth from rider to driver.",
