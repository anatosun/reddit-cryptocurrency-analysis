Go look at any article about the stock market. \"Sell now\" \"don't buy until we break x price point\"\n\nWealthy individuals are trying to conserve wealth, meaning they rotate out of weakness and into safety, at the same time they try to induce retail to follow so that when strength returns, they will be able to buy long before retail feels it safe to reenter. This is why guys like buffett and cuban tell you to buy regardless of the market conditions, because if the asset you're holding has long term value they are forced to purchase it back from you, not before you.\n\nEdit: for context no bear market has ever lasted 10 years. Meaning if you are truely a long term holder of the asset a bear market should ALWAYS be a buying opportunity, not a time to sell",

Are you investing in anything else?  Did you literally put ALL your faith in doge?  Have you ever heard of the saying \"never put all your eggs in 1 basket\"?\n\nYou bought into doge at the height of the world's greatest bull market and you want to blame dogecoin?  Take a look at every single equity market and crypto market as whole.  Everything rose and fell together.  Doge was the people's choice to rally into and swell the value, but once the bull market ends, there is no magical investment.  Correction comes to the entire market.  You are hoping for a magical situation. Wishful thinking.\n\nDoge will be one of the core places people go to cooperate for shared opportunity and will grow again to higher highs as long as we continue to promote our ethos to Do Only Good Everyday and not blame others for our own mistakes.\n\nNo blame on doge because you didn't understand you bought during a time of extreme market optimism and strong bull trend.  It is your responsibility to understand the risk, the economy, the situation and how to handle all of the above.\n\nWe'll be here holding our doge the same and if you want to join us, drop the blame game.",

Since crypto is mostly just supply and demand, it's even easier to predict. If you want to make some money in a cycle then you should have absolutely sold some too. There's no shame in that. Some want to make money on daily/weekly/monthly/yearly cycles, some want to make money on per big cycle that takes 2-4 years each cycle and some don't care about anything shorter than 2-5 such big cycles(The real holders). You're also allowed to be all of this at once. But as a holder that also use doge as a currency, know that there's nothing wrong with people making money during any cycle. \n\nAs long as the fundamentals stays the same and keeps improving with the growth of technology, usefulness keeps improving and adoption keeps growing, that's how you can hold for several cycles without ever having to worry about price going down 90% because already after the first cycle (If you invested before the cycle) you'll be sitting on 500%+ depending on where you bought. 2-5 more cycles will be a breeze and you'll be teaching panic stricken noobs how to not panic, to be emotionless and not envy people making money if their game plan is to hold for several cycles.\n\nNow look at those long straight lines before each cycle, that's where you buy the dip! People that buy the dip after a cycle \"for holding\" are being played and manipulated by whales. This is traders territory. All you're doing is giving whales and day traders exit liquidity.",

The Luna team had to sell all that expensive BTC and also sell Luna to restore the peg of UST to the US dollar. This has caused Luna, BTC and the entire market (including DOGE) to crash. \n\nInvestors started freaking and dumping too, which has only worsened the dump.\n\nThe attackers can now buy back their BTC on the cheap possibly doubling their holdings...\n\nThis is epic and sad and probably the result of a whale or group of whales. Now let's hope that those whales like our coins and buy our coins with their proceeds.\n\nWas it Soros? Was it the Fed? Was it Barry Silbert and friends? Jeff Bezos?

Crypto felt like a safe haven for the retailers but the reality is we became too strong for big money to ignore. Empowering a group of people goes against the very ideals of the \"hold the bag retailers while I make money\" hedgies. But there is a solution to the schemes. The HODL. Market manipulators only make money when they sell at highs and cause the slower retailers who don't look at the markets as a full-time job to sell off out of fear of more loss. But what if you don't fall for their trick? The HODL is the I don't care. I won't sell. No matter how low you push the market lower we are going to buy. Making your buyback be useless. Forcing you to buy at higher amounts even by cents causes them $millions if not billions in losses. These non-shorting crypto HODL ers are the true beasts. And in downturns, they make the most $$. They may own the stock market but they don't own my diamond hands. Welcome to the first recession during the crypto revolution boys and girls. HODL them coins, cause where markets go down, they inevitably go back up. It's a doge doge world.",

Yes, some retail investors too but Wallstreet money fluffed up many of the numbers and they will continue to use Doge and any crypto like any other stock ticker.  The way to diverge from that is for doge, and others to continue down the path of increasing the use cases beyond a stock ticker; ie: use for purchases, or in the case of some newer coins, grease to the cogs of Web3.  Until those are more mature uses, expect the traditional wallstreet money to do the same, mirroring the SPY or QQQ.  Sadly, because crypto is the new kid on the block, they might be more prone to dropping them over say their shares of Macys/Ford.  Time will tell but as someone who has the Steve Woz mentality behind crypto, we have to make actual use of the crypto.  I stupidly never bought BTC when it was $30 back when I was trying to mine it in 2011 and when Doge came on the scene, yes it was seen as a joke but for a time, despite being worth like .0005, was being used as the Donation crypto.  If doge can regain that identity, or gain more (heck it's just now in a Wordpress plugin) then it can rebound from this.",

There's overvaluation (at risk of being crucified by this subreddit, doge is probably the single best example of that) but *crypto itself* is still a very solid investment, I think. \n\nThe best investments in history, consistently, are in technologies that have room to grow. When even the engineers and inventors can't possibly consider *every* potential use-case, you know you've got something huge. Usually world changing. Examples of that abound. We had the \"dot com bubble\" but the internet didn't get less useful. It got more useful. And more valuable. Now it's impossible to consider how we'd do without it. Similarly, credit cards. I live in the city they started in (Fresno, CA). No one could've predicted the industry that would arise from that, and now we can't imagine life without them. \n\nI believe the same will happen to crypto. We're still in the infancy of it, and the current market slump is just shaking the tree to rid it of the dead leaves. Crypto is going to be in every facet of our lives in 20 years. IMO the ones to invest in are again, the ones you can't feasibly predict all the use cases for. Which is why most of mine is in Ethereum.",

I'm an early investor in doge and other cryptos and I've lost well over 90% of the dollar cost of my portfolio at least six times so far.  It goes back up.  Although this is definitely a huge stress test on crypto with the Fed raising interest rates and purposefully crashing EVERYTHING.  Here's my two cents but dont' take this as investing advice.  They are moving the interest rates up now to give themselves some wiggle room.  There will be an everything crash that will make 2008 look like a tiny little blip on the charts.   I reckon this is when we finally will see negative interest rates.  If you thought crypto was flying high with 0% interest rates wait till it's -3% interest rates.  I'm not saying it's going to to happen but, it's already happened in a number of countries across the world.  This is gonna be a tough time.  Put your head down, go for walks outside, take care of yourself, eat good, meditate, focus on your hobbies, don't quit your job and take care of your family.  It's gonna get rougher before it gets better.",
