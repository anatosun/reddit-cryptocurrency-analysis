You can also get the private key for this wallet from the SoDogeTip website. You can transfer dogecoins into this wallet address and begin giving dogecoin to other people on reddit! And using your key you can also send coins yourself, even if the tipbot is down\nMaybe you see a meme that made you laugh? Give them a few dogecoin.\nMaybe you see an insightful post that helped you understand something better? Give them a few dogecoin.\nMaybe you see a charity you'd like to donate to. Do it with sodogetip. \n\nYou can also get the latest version of the dogecoin wallet (version  1.14.5) from www.dogecoin.com \n\n---\n\nHere are some links and topics that people have wanted me to post here.

Go look at any article about the stock market. \"Sell now\" \"don't buy until we break x price point\"\n\nWealthy individuals are trying to conserve wealth, meaning they rotate out of weakness and into safety, at the same time they try to induce retail to follow so that when strength returns, they will be able to buy long before retail feels it safe to reenter. This is why guys like buffett and cuban tell you to buy regardless of the market conditions, because if the asset you're holding has long term value they are forced to purchase it back from you, not before you.\n\nEdit: for context no bear market has ever lasted 10 years. Meaning if you are truely a long term holder of the asset a bear market should ALWAYS be a buying opportunity, not a time to sell",

Take a look at every single equity market and crypto market as whole.  Everything rose and fell together.  Doge was the people's choice to rally into and swell the value, but once the bull market ends, there is no magical investment.  Correction comes to the entire market.  You are hoping for a magical situation. Wishful thinking.\n\nDoge will be one of the core places people go to cooperate for shared opportunity and will grow again to higher highs as long as we continue to promote our ethos to Do Only Good Everyday and not blame others for our own mistakes.\n\nNo blame on doge because you didn't understand you bought during a time of extreme market optimism and strong bull trend.  It is your responsibility to understand the risk, the economy, the situation and how to handle all of the above.\n\nWe'll be here holding our doge the same and if you want to join us, drop the blame game.",

Since crypto is mostly just supply and demand, it's even easier to predict. If you want to make some money in a cycle then you should have absolutely sold some too. There's no shame in that. Some want to make money on daily/weekly/monthly/yearly cycles, some want to make money on per big cycle that takes 2-4 years each cycle and some don't care about anything shorter than 2-5 such big cycles(The real holders). You're also allowed to be all of this at once. But as a holder that also use doge as a currency, know that there's nothing wrong with people making money during any cycle. \n\nAs long as the fundamentals stays the same and keeps improving with the growth of technology, usefulness keeps improving and adoption keeps growing, that's how you can hold for several cycles without ever having to worry about price going down 90% because already after the first cycle (If you invested before the cycle) you'll be sitting on 500%+ depending on where you bought. 2-5 more cycles will be a breeze and you'll be teaching panic stricken noobs how to not panic, to be emotionless and not envy people making money if their game plan is to hold for several cycles.\n\nNow look at those long straight lines before each cycle, that's where you buy the dip! People that buy the dip after a cycle \"for holding\" are being played and manipulated by whales. This is traders territory. All you're doing is giving whales and day traders exit liquidity.",

The Luna team had to sell all that expensive BTC and also sell Luna to restore the peg of UST to the US dollar. This has caused Luna, BTC and the entire market (including DOGE) to crash. \n\nInvestors started freaking and dumping too, which has only worsened the dump.\n\nThe attackers can now buy back their BTC on the cheap possibly doubling their holdings...\n\nThis is epic and sad and probably the result of a whale or group of whales. Now let's hope that those whales like our coins and buy our coins with their proceeds.\n\nWas it Soros? Was it the Fed? Was it Barry Silbert and friends? Jeff Bezos?

Crypto felt like a safe haven for the retailers but the reality is we became too strong for big money to ignore. Empowering a group of people goes against the very ideals of the \"hold the bag retailers while I make money\" hedgies. But there is a solution to the schemes. The HODL. Market manipulators only make money when they sell at highs and cause the slower retailers who don't look at the markets as a full-time job to sell off out of fear of more loss. But what if you don't fall for their trick? The HODL is the I don't care. I won't sell. No matter how low you push the market lower we are going to buy. Making your buyback be useless. Forcing you to buy at higher amounts even by cents causes them $millions if not billions in losses. These non-shorting crypto HODL ers are the true beasts. And in downturns, they make the most $$. They may own the stock market but they don't own my diamond hands. Welcome to the first recession during the crypto revolution boys and girls. HODL them coins, cause where markets go down, they inevitably go back up. It's a doge doge world.",
