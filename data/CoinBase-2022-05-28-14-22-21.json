Mine was a transaction from 2 months ago i even got the product i ordered in the mail so it was payed and the people i got it from said they only see one charge for my card number.. so from what they are telling me is COINBASE covered the 1st transaction(even though i had the money to cover it in my account) and then they charged me 2 months later for it this latest charge does not show up under card transactions , the only place i could find it was under the tax printout you can get, so this is like a overdraft but without the fees, I keep my card locked as well at all times.   To me it looks like coinbase is stealing money from its customers.,",
