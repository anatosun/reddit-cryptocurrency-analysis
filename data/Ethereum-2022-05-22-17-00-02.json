            "selftext": "Several Core Devs say they expect the merge to go through in August 2022, assuming all testing goes well. The plan is to merge hard fork Ropsten testnet on June 8th, followed then by the Sepolia and Goerli testnets, in that order, over the next few weeks.  They will also continue doing mainnet shadowforks concurrently as well.  If no major issues are found, mainnet merge is expected no later than August 2022.  By that time, blocktimes will be about \\~20s due to the difficulty bomb having gone off (it has already started). \n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/uvey0j)",
