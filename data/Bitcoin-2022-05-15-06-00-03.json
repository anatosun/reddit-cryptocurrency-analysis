He says he's on a business trip in Switzerland, but his \"diamond competitors\" or people who run \"rival mines\" are tracking his movement and want to do bad things to him. He says he can't spend his own money because then they are able to track his movements. He asks the women to take out multiple $50k loans to wire him money, which they do. In the beginning, they wire him $50k, and he pays them back $75k, to earn their trust. Then he ups the stakes and bleeds them for everything they're worth. The thing is, since he changed his name to look like he's actually the son of the diamond empire, they fall for it. He also meets up with them before hand and takes them on expensive vacations with fake security guards to make it all seem real.",

Institutional interest in BTC has grown by leaps and bounds, Janet Yellen has been referring to BTC, countries have begun to invest in it, advances have taken place in supporting tech infrastructure. Every indication is that BTC is not only here to stay but will thrive. Just don\u2019t expect to become a millionaire overnight. There will be frustrating days interspersed with good days.

The most powerful feeling is fear.  When the price goes up, those people fear missing out, and buy.  When the price goes down, those people fear losing wealth, and sell -- which is totally illogical, but they're not using the logical hemispheres.  These people literally buy high and sell low.  Go ahead, call them idiots; that's what they are.\n\nThere are times and places where feelings are important.  There are times/places in our lives where our fear is telling us something very important which could affect our survival.  However, making long term investing decisions (esp. w/ Bitcoin) is not one of those times/places.  Bitcoin investors need to be logical, planning ahead based upon solid understanding, and so forth; ideally we do not get lazy and give into fear.\n\nNot everybody has what it takes to become and remain a multimillionaire.",
