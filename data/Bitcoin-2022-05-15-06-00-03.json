You're right, it's 100% contradictory. He basically \"Nigerian Princes\" them. He says he's on a business trip in Switzerland, but his \"diamond competitors\" or people who run \"rival mines\" are tracking his movement and want to do bad things to him. He says he can't spend his own money because then they are able to track his movements. He asks the women to take out multiple $50k loans to wire him money, which they do. In the beginning, they wire him $50k, and he pays them back $75k, to earn their trust. Then he ups the stakes and bleeds them for everything they're worth. The thing is, since he changed his name to look like he's actually the son of the diamond empire, they fall for it. He also meets up with them before hand and takes them on expensive vacations with fake security guards to make it all seem real.",
