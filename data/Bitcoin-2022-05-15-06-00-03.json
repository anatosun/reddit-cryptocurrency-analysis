He says he's on a business trip in Switzerland, but his \"diamond competitors\" or people who run \"rival mines\" are tracking his movement and want to do bad things to him. He says he can't spend his own money because then they are able to track his movements. He asks the women to take out multiple $50k loans to wire him money, which they do. In the beginning, they wire him $50k, and he pays them back $75k, to earn their trust. Then he ups the stakes and bleeds them for everything they're worth. The thing is, since he changed his name to look like he's actually the son of the diamond empire, they fall for it. He also meets up with them before hand and takes them on expensive vacations with fake security guards to make it all seem real.",

Fears of recession, strength of the dollar at all time high, rate increases by the fed, stocks down, etc. Also Bitcoin goes through boom and bust cycles on its road to price discovery so it could just be that to a degree. Short answer is nobody knows the full picture.",

They are barely connected, but they do communicate with each other.\n\nMany people live most of their lives relying upon their \"feelings\" brain instead of their \"logical\" brain -- even when investing.  The most powerful feeling is fear.  When the price goes up, those people fear missing out, and buy.  When the price goes down, those people fear losing wealth, and sell -- which is totally illogical, but they're not using the logical hemispheres.  These people literally buy high and sell low.  Go ahead, call them idiots; that's what they are.\n\nThere are times and places where feelings are important.  There are times/places in our lives where our fear is telling us something very important which could affect our survival.  However, making long term investing decisions (esp. w/ Bitcoin) is not one of those times/places.  Bitcoin investors need to be logical, planning ahead based upon solid understanding, and so forth; ideally we do not get lazy and give into fear.\n\nNot everybody has what it takes to become and remain a multimillionaire.",

And I'll buy again to hodl if there's a good opportunity but I'm not naive enough to believe btc will ever replace fiat. It's total nonsense. I'm a realistic adult that's actually been doing this successfully for over half a decade as opposed to the half year most people on this sub are invested in. Not a pessimistic child. Try to be objective when you invest and ignore internet hype. Btc isn't taking over anything. It's purely an extremely liquid asset that presents millions of opportunities for investors and traders on a regular basis. It also gets manipulated constantly. Tell me how something that changes value by 1000% in a year or loses 50% of it's value in a week can ever replace fiat. It'll never happen.",
