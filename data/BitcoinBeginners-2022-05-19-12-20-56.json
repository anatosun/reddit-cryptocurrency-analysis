If you want to use coinjoin than wasabi, joinmarket or samourai wallet are better choices \n\nHopefully you picked the exception to this . Essentially what they might be saying is their software is so out of date they don't recognize newer native segwit address types(another reason to avoid them )\n\nWhat you need to do is create a wallet that has a legacy P2SH segwit address that start with a 3 instead so they don't have this excuse \n\nBlockstream green allows you to create p2sh segwit address types \n\nhttps://blockstream.com/green/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO3Zi9D5b0Y",
