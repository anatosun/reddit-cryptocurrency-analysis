They don't have a chief of strategy.  \n\nYou do actually see far better constructed scam mails but they tend to be aimed at corporate systems.  Scamming corporations is where the real money is and you do see a higher level of scammer skill.",

Here you want to ensure that the people the fall for the first step are highly likely to fall for it all the way, so some pre-selection needs to be done.\n\nHowever, the type of phishing scams that this email is about can be done pretty much fully automatic. The phishing website that this email leads to will grab your credentials and then at least a log in attempt (to verify that the entered credentials are correct) can be done automatically. There's no harm in not scaring off the smarter people. Either they won't buy it in the end and leave the phishing website (which doesn't cost the scammer anything) or you end up with another victim that would've otherwise not have fallen for it.",
