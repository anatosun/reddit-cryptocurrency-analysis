            "selftext": "Anatomy of a Sim Swap attack of an Iphone X.\n\nNOTE: my info was leaked in ledger hack.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, at 5:30pm today someone walked into a Tmobile store, claiming my identity and swapped my sim.  At 5:45pm I noticed my texts  were not sending.  I had no phone calling ability.  Other house mobile phones worked. Wifi internet on my phone worked.  I see an alert on my chase account of a credit inquiry at Macy's Department store minutes later.  At that point I knew it was a sim card swap attack.  I called Tmobile.   Recording says, \"1 hour wait.\"  I leave my wifes number for them to call back.  I race over to the Tmobile store 5 minutes away and plead my case. \"Stop the phone access.\"  They research and see that the swap happened at a store but can't say which one.  They call into Tmobile to figure out next steps.  While we are waiting, I get the call back from Tmobile corporate.  They agree it is a fraud case and they switch the sim back to my phone, I regain access within 1 hour or so since the swap occurred.  I agreed to switch phone numbers being that I was hacked once already, I will likely continue to be a target due to the ledger hack. By this time I am checking all my crypto accounts and gmail.\n\nI had AUTHENTICATOR 2FA: on everything except for binance, cash app(luckily tied to a DIFFERENT phone number), breez.\n\nNo evidence of entry to my gmail account.  No evidence of entry to binance or other accounts.\n\nSo far only fraud is Macy's Department store credit.\n\nTmobile says they will follow up and have fully logged this as a fraud/identity theft. I called Chase credit monitoring and have a case open on the Macy's credit inquiry.\n\nI will update if hackers were able to access anything else of my accounts/crypto in that 1 hour time span.\n\nTHANK YOU all previous people who have told your story about these attacks.  Hopefully my quick recognition and intervention saved me some $$.  Nevertheless there was very little crypto they had access to because almost all big accounts have authenticator 2FA (no sms 2fa).\n\nIF YOUR PHONE STOPS WORKING, but wifi works etc.  First response should be to confirm it is a sim swap attack.\n\nQuestion: Is my iphone metamask ethereum account threatened still somehow?  I see no unrecognized transactions.  Was it threatened at all during the sim swap?",
