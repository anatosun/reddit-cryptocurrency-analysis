A good rule for this sub is to include as much info as possible w*ithout including anything personal.* There's not enough here to comment about the problem.\n2. Someone here is already saying \"DM me I can help\" and this is very dodgy behaviour. Others should see this and learn to avoid this like the plague.\n\nFor example, you could elaborate on what \"forced to migrate to wallet\" means. I have never been forced to migrate anything from Coinbase. Who / how /why are you being forced?\n\nWhy can't you get your bitcoins back?\n\nRemember, *no personal info* like name, email, Coinbase case ID / ticket number, account, value, crypto address etc. But a bit more detail on the problem will be helpful for everyone.\n\nDo not DM anybody about these things unless they are 100% Coinbase support (i.e. they have a coinbase work email address AND it's come through Coinbase support platform)",

The coinbase wallet yes is not owned by coinbase but is endorsed by coinbase and is advertised by coinbase. The wallet is almost a dead wallet cuz as soon as you put money into it or coins it will cost you at least $15 to move anything in or out. Also if you try to trade coins on there it's a fee of $400 to $1,000. If you don't believe me go to the app store look up the reviews or actually go to the coinbase wallet reddit and you will see everything you need to.",
