A good rule for this sub is to include as much info as possible w*ithout including anything personal.* There's not enough here to comment about the problem.\n2. Someone here is already saying \"DM me I can help\" and this is very dodgy behaviour. Others should see this and learn to avoid this like the plague.\n\nFor example, you could elaborate on what \"forced to migrate to wallet\" means. I have never been forced to migrate anything from Coinbase. Who / how /why are you being forced?\n\nWhy can't you get your bitcoins back?\n\nRemember, *no personal info* like name, email, Coinbase case ID / ticket number, account, value, crypto address etc. But a bit more detail on the problem will be helpful for everyone.\n\nDo not DM anybody about these things unless they are 100% Coinbase support (i.e. they have a coinbase work email address AND it's come through Coinbase support platform)",

Most things are hard to price right now which is why the volatility index is so high.

Heres a classic, lets say you want to send UST from Kucoin to Terra Station for the Anchor interest.  No problem you just get your Terra Station address and put it into Kucoin and send it off.  Everything is fine.\n\nNow lets say you made some interest and you want to pull some profits, so you do the reverse.  You send your UST from Terra Station to Kucoin.  Click the submit button and whoops.  Guess what you forgot to add a Memo!  Now this is where Kucoin makes a huge profit.  They will charge you anywhere from 30 to 100 bucks for the service to put your UST into your Kucoin account all because you forgot the Memo.   Going from Kucoin to Terra no memo is needed.  However going back to Kucoin, Memo is a must!   I cannot tell you how many posts I have seen of this, Kucoin is making a boatload of money on this No Memo added.",

On Coinbase Pro or the new Advanced Trade feature, this spread comes directly from the order book and can vary a lot. When using the retail app, I believe Coinbase uses a more consistent (and slightly larger) spread to hedge against changes the underlying order book (or for cases where a direct order book between those two currencies doesn't exist, and the conversion has to go through USD or another intermediary currency on the backend). It's essentially hiding the complexity of placing an order directly and making it more convenient. For the smallest spread and smaller fees, consider using Coinbase Pro or Advanced Trade instead of the convert feature within the main app.",

You can have a copy of that BAYC image, but unless you're authenticated as the actual owner, you don't get access to what's behind that ownership. \n\nThis literally comes down to the simple idea of doing your own thorough research on anything you're thinking of investing in. This post isn't about whether it's a scam or not, it's how to go about creating an NFT if that's what you feel like you want to try. \n\nI'm fortunate enough to have a tech start-up that is building an NFT platform in Web 3.0. I'll just say that before you jump onto the scam bandwagon, really look into the space more and try and look for genuine opportunities. They are definitely out there. Once that have provided me extremely good ROI, hence my commitment to education on my subreddit r/WhatTheNFT",

You can try as hard as you can to twist it to sound beneficial but at the end of the day it is a scam.\n\nYou made a post teaching people how to make NFTs. No one has anyone of value to give. It\u2019s a fucking scamming man. \n\nI make a drawing and turn it into a NFT. I own the drawing and the person who buys my NFT just spent money on nothing of value because they don\u2019t own it. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason why less then .1% of people in cryptocurrency actually fuck around with NFTs. We all know it\u2019s a scam.\n\nPeople are coming into NFTs thinking they own that picture, video or song and that\u2019s not true. It\u2019s a scam.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this shit before even before the internet. People selling the golden state bridge and Statue of Liberty. It\u2019s a scam",

Considering 90% of projects are purely speculative and have literally no use case or working utility. \n\nYou are really missing the point of NFTs, you keep harping on about the same thing and clearly don\u2019t have the understanding that in good projects, it\u2019s not about the picture. \n\nAnyway mate, good luck to you.

The coinbase wallet yes is not owned by coinbase but is endorsed by coinbase and is advertised by coinbase. The wallet is almost a dead wallet cuz as soon as you put money into it or coins it will cost you at least $15 to move anything in or out. Also if you try to trade coins on there it's a fee of $400 to $1,000. If you don't believe me go to the app store look up the reviews or actually go to the coinbase wallet reddit and you will see everything you need to.",

Heres a classic, lets say you want to send UST from Kucoin to Terra Station for the Anchor interest.  No problem you just get your Terra Station address and put it into Kucoin and send it off.  Everything is fine.\n\nNow lets say you made some interest and you want to pull some profits, so you do the reverse.  You send your UST from Terra Station to Kucoin.  Click the submit button and whoops.  Guess what you forgot to add a Memo!  Now this is where Kucoin makes a huge profit.  They will charge you anywhere from 30 to 100 bucks for the service to put your UST into your Kucoin account all because you forgot the Memo.   Going from Kucoin to Terra no memo is needed.  However going back to Kucoin, Memo is a must!   I cannot tell you how many posts I have seen of this, Kucoin is making a boatload of money on this No Memo added.",

I recommend you hire a knowledgeable crypto consultant to help you investigate, file a police report, and file a report with Coinbase. Although most people here will tell you your money is gone, sometimes the funds can be traced. If the thief put the funds on a KYC exchange (which they likely did not) then it is possible the account holder could be identified. The chances of recovery are very low. Full documentation of this incident will probably help you in dealing with your creditors down the road. Good luck",

Heres a classic, lets say you want to send UST from Kucoin to Terra Station for the Anchor interest.  No problem you just get your Terra Station address and put it into Kucoin and send it off.  Everything is fine.\n\nNow lets say you made some interest and you want to pull some profits, so you do the reverse.  You send your UST from Terra Station to Kucoin.  Click the submit button and whoops.  Guess what you forgot to add a Memo!  Now this is where Kucoin makes a huge profit.  They will charge you anywhere from 30 to 100 bucks for the service to put your UST into your Kucoin account all because you forgot the Memo.   Going from Kucoin to Terra no memo is needed.  However going back to Kucoin, Memo is a must!   I cannot tell you how many posts I have seen of this, Kucoin is making a boatload of money on this No Memo added.",

Here's a part of the shit show the EU is trying to pass.  \n\n>\u201cAmong the worst of the proposed provisions are new obligations on exchanges to collect, verify and report information on non-customers using self-hosted wallets,\u201d said Grewal. \u201cFor instance, one provision requires exchanges to not only collect personal data about wallet users who are not their customers, but to also verify the data\u2019s accuracy before allowing a transfer to one of their customers.\u201d\n\nTaken from this link [https://blockworks.co/eu-to-vote-on-revised-regulation-targeting-crypto-transfers/](https://blockworks.co/eu-to-vote-on-revised-regulation-targeting-crypto-transfers/)  \n\nThis would mean if i was to send you \u00a31000 in BTC from my private wallet to your Coinbase account Coinbase would need to verify MY details BEFORE they allow the transfer to clear in to your account. Now what if i decide not to give Coinbase my details or how would Coinbase even contact me if i don't hold a Coinbase account in the first place? You would be left with a blocked transfer of funds sitting in escrow unable to be sent back to me or you.  \n\nCoinbase would need to report the transfer to the local authorities for this new \"Anti laundering law\" which more than likely will end up with you being investigated every time forcing Coinbase to lock your account and hold all funds without telling you until the investigation is complete.  \n\nIt's absolutely bullshit and if they want to do this then i would fully expect them to do this to banks and cash payments also. Imagine buying a \u00a31000 TV only to be told you need to hand over ID, proof of address, proof of where the funds came from like a bank statement etc... Or if it's via bank transfer or card payment the banks will require all the customers data to be sent across with the payment.  \n\nIf you want the direct link to the legislation it's here [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0422](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0422)  \n\nas another note The consequence of this\u2026is that most crypto companies won\u2019t be able or willing to transact with unhosted wallets anymore in order to stay compliant so no more cold storage or private wallets only exchange wallets so safety is out the window.  \n\nAnother link helping to explain it https://thecryptotime.com/the-european-parliament-wants-to-discriminate-the-option-to-keep-your-crypto-asset-keys/",

These wallets take a private key to derive an address for different blockchains so, to the user, it looks like they are storing all of their crypto in the same wallet. It comes down to preference.\n\nPersonally, I think that abstraction makes it more difficult to understand what is actually happening on the blockchain. That\u2019s why I recommend using an officially supported wallet for the community you\u2019re interested in.\n\nFor Algorand, use Pera Wallet (formerly called Algorand Wallet). For Nano, use Natrium. For Etherium (or EVM-Compatible chains: Cronos, Avalanche, Harmony, etc) use MetaMask. For Stellar Lumens (XLM), use LOBSTR. It sounds very cumbersome to manage different apps but it\u2019s really not. It helps you learn how each network functions and you have full control of the private keys. That\u2019s why I suggest keeping a collection of index cards to keep them secure.\n\nThis is the best way to actually \u201cuse\u201d crypto and learn about it. If it\u2019s only left on an exchange, you\u2019re really limited to just holding and trading.",

Coinbase Wallet would have fees identical to MetaMask, as those gas fees are from Ethereum, all wallets pay the same.\n\nSo how does Coinbase *the exchange* swap for so cheap? It's quite simple actually, and is a great representation of the \"not your keys, not your coins\" phrase. When you have coins on Coinbase, Coinbase actually owns those coins. They show you essentially an IOU. You sent (or have paid money for) 1 ETH, and therefore they tell you that you have 1 ETH. The next time you try to withdraw they show your balance as 1 ETH and so they give you that ETH when you actually withdraw.\n\nIn the meantime before you withdraw, you simply have that IOU. So if you tell them, \"hey trade that 1 ETH into BTC\", they simply change your IOU letter. Now they don't owe you 1 ETH, they owe you BTC instead. Coins don't actually move in the process.\n\nThis makes for cheap trades, which is great, and the main feature of exchanges. But exchanges aren't actual wallets. Everyone's coins are pooled together, and everyone gets their IOU notes. That's why the \"not your keys, not your coins\" applies. If Coinbase suddenly shutdown, or got hacked, your coins are gone. Obviously that's  illegal and you could sue for repayment but the fact of the matter is your coins are gone. Think Mt.Gox.\n\nAnyways, don't mean to scare you about Coinbase, the IOU applies to all centralized exchanges, and Coinbase has insurance in place to hopefully help protect its customers if a hack did occur. But that's why it's so cheap to trade on exchanges vs DEX's.",
