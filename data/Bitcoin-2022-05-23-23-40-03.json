If you need to keep it on an exchange with Crypto.com you can stake your crypto for up to 3 months and it can\u2019t be touched, sold, moved. This has helped me in the past from wanting to sell but also a piece of mind that nothing or anyone not even yourself can do anything with it while staked. That gives you time to figure out what that did and fix the issue.",
