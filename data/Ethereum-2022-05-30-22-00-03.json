            "selftext": "The outlet for whom this article was intended got cold feet about running it, so here's my report on ETHDenver 2022...\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe first ETHDenver was in 2018, deep in bear market doldrums. Hopium was lost. There was a whiff of vapor in the ware. Rumor has it that ETHDenver programming that year was just Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki in a rented bufficorn costume offering bounties for free hugs to an empty auditorium. Even in those salad days of free-wheeling pre-COVID physical contact, few people accepted. Oh, how things have changed.\n\nAfter surviving an existentially challenging bear market and a near apocalyptic pandemic only to emerge stronger than ever, the mood amongst ETHNerds at ETHDenver 2022 was buoyant, only a gentle caress short of euphoric. Over 20,000 applicants for an event that could comfortably have accommodated a tenth of that meant this year was always going to be an unprecedented clusterfuck. That sense of euphoria lasted only until attendees encountered the line to get in. ETHDenver\u2019s (ostensibly noble) COVID test upon entry policy meant a three hour wait to get in as the line snaked down the block, across the street, and almost into adjacent time zones \u2014 all caked in a post-snowstorm slurry. And wait they did, in droves, and for days on end.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThat kind of excitement can only mean one thing. Lines for a COVID test. Lines for the elevator. Lines to get into talks. Lines for the bathroom. Lines *in* the bathroom. Crypto has two modes: Apocalypse and utopia. ETHDenver was firmly the latter. Self-flagellation is out. Self-congratulation is in. That\u2019s because Web3 and DeFi and NFTs and DAOs have all achieved mainstream buzzword status, and none of those exists without Ethereum. You can tip people with ETH on Twitter. Fucky Zucky thought hijacking the metaverse could save his sinking ship. He must be sniffing metamine. Shit, Even Melania Trump bought her own NFT. And if Trump Org is grifting in your backyard, there\u2019s gold in them hills. It\u2019s a whole different kind of gold rush out here in Denver.\u00a0\n\nThe thing is that Ethereum tech actually works now. Well, sorta. It may cost $73 and take a few hours, but if you want to spend $23 million on a jpeg of a monkey \u2013 that utopian reality is yours for the making. Do you want to loan a derivative of a derivative of a derivative of a dog-themed meme coin? Sure! Just please don\u2019t call it a derivative or the SEC will sue everyone. APY? In this economy?! Fuck that. What\u2019s your yield by the *nanosecond*? Imagine your favorite, most esoteric MMORPG, but with the graphics of a 16-bit Animal Crossing. Sounds not bad, right? Now imagine it with a JPMorgan Lounge. That\u2019s Metaverse, baby!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAt any crypto event, you\u2019re gonna hear a heap of new lingo: Ponzinomics, POAP, danksharding, pussyverse, proto-shard data-blobs. Did you know that play-to-earn can solve poverty? That must have something to do with the Doge-wrapped McLaren parked in front of the Art Hotel. It was gone by day 3, so here\u2019s hoping that someone vandalized it.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s 4pm on a weekday in the Castle, in a cavernous side room shrouded in fog and laden with the rolling thud of house music. Countless exhausted future Bufficorns lay supine in beanbag chairs, staring at the canopy of lasers above them weaving cerulean and lavender spears. Excited groups of kids share shots of liquor. A one man dance party shuffles alone in the center of the room until a gaggle of girls bound into the space and join him. Is this a tech conference or a music festival?\u00a0\n\nThis could be the year that ETHDenver became SXSW for Crypto. It looks like the NFT gold rush has blown the space wide open culturally. The cool kids have arrived, and en masse. You can spot them because they share the same fashion aesthetic as a bored ape: animal prints, goofy sunglasses, glittering sequins, thousand yard stare. It\u2019s too much for some, mostly the jaded blockchain marketing vets standing confused on the outskirts of all things, wondering how they haven\u2019t downloaded Metamask mobile yet despite working in crypto for a half decade. They\u2019ve spent a good portion of their careers slaving for \u2018blockchain adoption,\u2019 and now that it\u2019s staring them in the face, they have no idea how to react other than slugging liquor for brunch, dazed,  mumbling to themselves about ConsenSys equity.\u00a0\n\nTheir energy is in stark contrast to the chillionaires, the very rich, very relaxed individuals with very few complaints about life. They\u2019re the guys who bought hundreds of thousands of ETH at a fraction of a dollar. You can spot them because they\u2019re wearing multiple rolexes on each arm, board shorts and flip flops, even in frigid-ass Denver. Nobody spots them faster than the bizdev shills, though, who are like guppies into the maw of these mega-whales. Here\u2019s how you survive a hard sell from one of those desperate pitchmen who treat you like a microphone: smile and nod, smile and nod. Do not answer any of their rhetorical questions, because they\u2019re all just hooks for another shill. Smile and nod. That\u2019s how a thousandaire becomes a chillionaire.\n\nWhile incredibly well socialized Ethereum developer Danny Ryan is on stage discussing semantic mismatches in the transition to Proof of Stake, the din from the reaches of the castle is deafening. Grizzled developers in newly spangled swag sweatshirts yuk it up with NFT obsessives in bedazzled leopard print, comparing shillhaul \u2013 which this year included free weed, USB lighters, and translucent metal sporks. Tiesto is in the building. The governor of Colorado just showed up. Vitalik\u2019s mum is holding court. Someone dressed as Boba Fett saunters through the crowd.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe merge is really, actually very close,\u201d Ryan exhorts over the noise. That gets everyone\u2019s attention. Ethereum Maxis talk about the merge like Heaven\u2019s Gate members talked about the comet. It\u2019s the second coming of Jesus and Jobs and Jehovah alike. On the day the *don\u2019t-call-it-ETH2.0* shards enliven, Vitalik will ride into the floor of the NYSE on a pale unicorn atop a rainbow that rains coins to save us all from our current reality: the one in which we\u2019re already in a bear market and nobody except for VC Cunts and chillionaires have the wherewithal to admit it yet.\u00a0\n\nSpeaking of: Look to your left. Now look to your right. chances are that one of you is a VC cunt. The \u2018VC\u2019 stands for \u2018very cunty.\u2019 A message to your ilk from the rest of us: Take your billions of dollars, your fuckin\u2019 social skills, your well-adjusted attachment styles, your consistent sleep habits, your workout routines, your pearly white teeth \u2014 and go copy/paste someone else\u2019s Ponzi scheme!\u00a0\n\nIn the spirit of self-congratulation, ETH devs are here to PARTY. That means drinking enough alcohol to maintain eye contact! Woo! A fresh-faced, motor-mouthed young Web3 acolyte who works for a VC \u2014\u00a0 although he promises it\u2019s not a cunty VC \u2014 has a salient piece of advice for anyone, but especially those in crypto: Never meet your idols. He encountered one of his at an ETHDenver afterparty, a guy \u2018worth a quarter of a billion at least,\u2019 languishing in a catatonic state, mumbling about \u2018the best acid in Denver.\u2019 Apparently, that did not fit his idea of a post-millennial tech baron. He\u2019s learned better now.\u00a0\n\nAn interlude: What does a stablecoin have in common with a dominatrix? It\u2019s all fun and games until you\u2019re in too deep and they lose their peg. If it\u2019s UST, you\u2019re moving back into mom\u2019s basement. If it\u2019s your local Mistress, you\u2019re going to the hospital. You\u2019re fucked either way. \n\nSpeaking of fucked: DAOs may be both the \u2018new venture capital\u2019 and the \u2018next sovereign nations,\u2019 but you may not get that vibe from the myriad DAOs that have proliferated in recent times \u2014 BluntDAO, PartyDAO, SporkDAO, SlutDAO, for example. DAOs may change the world yet, but not until they roll a blunt, have a boogie, get the munchies, and visit a sex worker \u2014 so just like most politicians, then.\u00a0\n\nWhile an opera singer takes to the stage on the upper BUIDL floors for an impromptu performance, surprise guest Andrew Yang appears on the main stage. The room is packed and the audience listens on rapt. The wider crypto industry has been waiting on tenterhooks on the promise of a damaging Executive Order from President Joe Biden, and Yang has the inside scoop. He\u2019s bullish on the EO, saying it won\u2019t be as bad as many fear, but bearish on the long-term prospects of governmental meddling in the space. He says it\u2019s a call to arms moment for the industry, and that we should all take it upon ourselves to fight back. He suggests gamifying lobbying, which actually sounds like a pretty good idea.\u00a0\n\nAll of this isn\u2019t to distract from the main point here: a conference with all the Etherati in one place is totally against the ethos of decentralization. Single point of failure! That\u2019s blockchain 101. What happens if one disgruntled Solana dev sneaks into the Castle with a bomb strapped to his back? They are capable of this. Those guys blow up their own chain on a monthly basis.\n\nThe real stuff at ETHDenver is on the upper floors of the Castle, where the devs have been at work hackathoning away since before the hordes arrived, and where they remained when the hordes left. Developers are more mythical beast than the bufficorn could ever be, and here\u2019s where you find those rare creatures in their habitat, buried deep behind the hype machines and money printers. Rows and rows of people, heads down, headphones on. This is the actual source of the substance of the event, the whole industry even. Shit, maybe even the whole world. Every so often, they take breaks to eat stale pizza and play DDR and Mario kart in the arcade, drum and bass blasting all the while. It\u2019s on these floors that  you\u2019ll find anything resembling solace in the chaos.\u00a0\n\nETHDenver is a place where the developers who build the stuff, the shills who sell it, the storytellers who narrate it, and now the consumers who actually use it are all there under one roof. Yeah, it\u2019s disorganized, but this is the kind of chaos from whence *stuff* happens. When things get organized, they get lame. ETHDenver is the Birthplace of BUIDL, and it retains that accolade. Sure, 20,000 applicants and only about 150 hackathon projects offers a ratio of about 1 in 20 builders to shillers, but that\u2019s pretty fucking good for crypto. Your average Bitcoin conference is just a mass congregation of undersexed sociopaths yelling past each other about Wikipedia-level macroeconomics. In comparison, ETHDenver is a wellspring of substance and positive energy.\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately the price of ETH did not mirror the buoyancy of the energy of ETHDenver, dropping over 15% over the course of the week. But nobody talked about markets or asset prices, even as they dropped precipitously and consistently all weekend. There\u2019s something beautiful about that. ETHDenver envisions itself as a builder of culture for Ethereum, decentralization, and the creation of value in communities, and it does come good on that promise.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s two surefire ways to know when a party is over. The first is when you receive a COVID exposure notification from the exclusive afterparty the night prior. The second is when fuckin\u2019 Diplo shows up. Both happened on Sunday night. The Denver airport was apparently like an Ethereum transaction mempool on Sunday night, so most of you are using the same criteria for figuring out when it\u2019s time to GTFO.\u00a0",

There's something about your writing style that feels like writing for some kind of campy sexploitation film or something else so as emotionally obtuse. The sensationalism wasn't offensive, but kind of banal. \n\nImagine yourself in the shoes of someone who wasn't there. Build up the visuals more illustratively rather than sensationally. The judgement is ok, but it can take a back seat so we can visualize the reality of the event.\n\nJust feels a bit too stubborn on proving a point that ultimately never comes through clearly.\n\nJust my $.02!

You wouldn't want to put it out in the public as you'd get spammed. Similarly, putting your eth address out there may attract hackers as people can see how much eth your address has. It's best to give it to trusted people/exchanges only for receiving crypto. If you do ever want to put your address out in public, such as forums and Reddit. Generate a new address/new eth Wallet with little to no funds in.\n\nThe private key is like your password and you should never give this to anyone.",

You might not want some people knowing where you live or how much your house is worth. So don't walk around with it printed on your T-shirt.\n\nThere are a lot of legitimate reasons to give out your address tho and plenty of people that you would share it with for those reasons.\n\nFinally, you should LITERALLY NEVER give anyone your seed phrase/key because doing so is the same giving them all of your money and trusting them not to take it.",

The public key allows anybody to deposit, see the balance, and all transactions.  The private key is a hash generated fron your seed words, these should be stored safely with a backup, and are never used unless you lose your wallet and need to reactivate it. A common scam is to direct you to a fake website and claim you need to put in seed words to reactivate your account... your wallet holds your private key and allows you to move the stuff in your letterbox, and will have a pin or password to open. Your stuff isnt in the wallet, its on the blockchain, your wallet just holds your keys. Again: you will only ever need your seed words if you lose your wallet in a boating accident and need to recreate it. Some thought should be given to how you backup seed words, they are the most important part of the whole thing.",
