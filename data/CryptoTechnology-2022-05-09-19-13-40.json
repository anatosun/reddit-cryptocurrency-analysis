I feel like I\u2019ve sifted through white papers, blog posts, and  AVAX developer YT vids but can\u2019t quite wrap my head around it. Would anyone out there be willing to take a stab or does anyone know some oversimplified educational resources? I\u2019m looking for an unbiased overview not just \u201cavalanche is perfect. Zero concerns here\u201d \n\nThanks everyone and happy late Mother\u2019s Day to all the mothers out there!",

Since there is no central party that gathers the votes and counts them to obtain the opinion of the majority, nodes select a random subset of nodes and asks them for their opinion, if the majority says A, the node changes its opinion to A. \n\nIt is called probabilistic as there is a high probability that if the majority of the network is of opnion A, the entire network will converge to adopt A.\nHowever, there is a small probability that even if a small subset of the network is of opnion B, the nodes with A may change their opinion to B if by chance their quorum is randomly chosen to be nodes of opinion B.\n\nTo avoid this as much as possible, the selection and query is done multiple times thereby reducing the probability the chance for a minority opinion to prevaile due to random sampling.\n\nThere are some specific changes avalanche made to the original algorithm but the idea behind it remains the same.",

It fundamentally relies on 2 core pillars:\n\n1. Is the transaction valid?\n2. Do others also think that the transaction is valid?\n\nAs more nodes confirm the transaction as valid, it'll eventually cross a set treshold for acceptance & be included into the chain. If there turns out to be any conflict, the the node verifies with other nodes to see if they accept the conflicting transaction. Over a long enough period of time, [the network will make up its mind on the conflict](https://docs.avax.network/overview/getting-started/avalanche-consensus#finality) & come to the same conclusion on whether to accept or reject a given transaction. As more blocks are added to the DAG, the confidence of a transaction being correct increases over time.",
