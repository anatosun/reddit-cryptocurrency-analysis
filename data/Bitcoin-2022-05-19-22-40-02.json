It was the wild west. \n\nI remember buying Bitcoin for a five figure $ amount back then in November of that year. \n\nAnd now look at me, look at all that had disbeliefs and told me it's a scam and a useless technology.\n\nToday I can say my profit is way beyond my imagination. It's down 30% and I'm still not knowing what's going on.\n\nEdit: I got in crypto in 2021. Sorry for the typo.\n\nEdit2.0: /s obv. Wtf :D",

Have been putting in about an hour per day on average for the past 365 days and although I think I have good macro understanding today, I'm going more into depth on the technical side now as well.

Andreas has already answered on the subject in a older post. \n\n\u00ab\u00a0Just to clarify: This was the Bitcoin Foundation's San Jose Bitcoin Conference in May 2013.\n\nI begged to speak and was an unknown. They finally agreed to give me a slot at the same time that Gavin Andreesen was delivering the \"State of the Bitcoin Union\" talk in the main hall. Most people were in that talk, and after it ended a few more trickled in to my room. Also, the few that were there sat in the back near the door, not quite committing to my talk and ready to leave. By the end there were 20-30 people in the last 3 rows.\n\nI did not find it at all humiliating. I enjoyed giving the talk and then went to watch other talks and mingle with the rest of the people at the conference. There are probably only about 500 people total if I remember. It was a fantastic experience and I met many of my \"heroes\" of the early bitcoin age that day.\n\nThank you all for your kind comments. \u00bb",

It is no longer confiscating its shareholders \"deserved earnings\" keeping discretionary power for itself instead of giving that power to its owners.\n\nA neutral society would work the same way with UBI/freedom dividends.  \"The administrator\" pays its equal citizen owners all of the administration revenue.  Whenever, most of us agree that something should be administered for us by the administration, we all pay an equal share of that program as a reduction in our dividend.\n\nUBI is starting with a neutral society that has no poverty, and no likelihood for violence, and then only considers programs that would make it better.",

Make it discursive, don't deliver to like four people. That's not how education works. You can make it far more engaging by asking them questions and using your knowledge to deliver in conjunction with an emergent narrative (made possible through participation).\n\nIt's far more fun for everybody and you, as a presenter, get to learn something about your audience. You get to form cognitive profiles of the kind of people you'll be speaking to in the future. You don't have that opportunity if you simply deliver a presentation.\n\nSmall groups present massive opportunities all round and will make you a better presenter. Take it as a win.",

The hole in that thought experiment is that there are thousands of other people making transactions at the same time with potentially the same amount. etherscan  [https://etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) does not record IP addresses so even if they had suspicions that I (or someone) has a crypto wallet solely based on IP information that doesn\u2019t help them figuring out which transaction is mine let alone what kind of wallet. Even if one bought and withdrew right away they can only make guesses on which block the transaction was confirmed in as well as who\u2019s wallet is who\u2019s. On top of that, there is no backdoor to software wallets at least the ones i use, so they could\u2019nt intercept anything unless they had my seed phrase.

And you are right.  Maybe B is still holding on to your 0.1.\n\nBut the point isn't that they can't prove *beyond a reasonable doubt* whether C should be blacklisted for its association to A.  It never has been, and it's something people get wrong.  They know the limits of chainalysis and tracking UTXOs, but then they take the next step to \"Well since I don't know for sure, that means nobody will ever **pretend they do and use that**\".  Wrong, dead in its tracks.  The government will, and does.  Whether you are falsely flagged or not is irrelevant again.\n\nThe point is the government doesn't give a shit about 100% accuracy.  Their \"blacklists\" don't track things so much as build a network of associates and accomplices with varying degrees of certainty based on locality, timing, curious activities where amounts match up (N to M matching, not 1 to 1 only), identities IRL of individuals in the network, and so on.  It's a service, like a google search which returns relevancy rather than the old search engines that returned exact matches or nothing.\n\nIn the example above:  they know A, B and C are weakly linked.  If other inbound BTC to A arrives from different addresses and the totals out at C seem to add up to that over time, they are more sure B is acting like a hidden layer in a network (may be many B's).  Mixers and coinjoins are almost irrelevant.  The entity is **focused** on a area of the network, so will soon find other things linked in 2-3 degrees of A, and see addresses looking very much like C.  They notice all of these C-like addresses handled in total what came in to A; they are the distribution network.  Distribution network may be big, but to decrease attack surface (social attack) and increase end user experience it won't be # of individual recipients, so it's manageable to track.\n\nThey at no point know for sure whether they are right, but tell the exchanges to block those addresses as withdrawal ones (that's fine who cares) but also reject deposits from them.  The exchange loses 0.0001% business and doesn't give a shit.  \n\nThe exchange, upon getting a hit on that address (some trucker goes to put his BTC on an exchange to convert to fiat), pings the government service and says \"Hey, this address is this KYC guy\", and then his funds are frozen with his bank, and IRL detectives can complete his part of the network, exposing more and more people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe safe and educate yourself on what big data can do, then look back at BTC and realize it's applied there as well.  I love BTC, but it's not a panacea.",

A 0.01 BTC deposit to a 20 BTC address may not be flagged because it's a drop in the bucket (unless all deposits are that size).  Dust attacks (whether to track wallets or to do the exact tainting you describe) have been done, and because of their small size amount to nothing usually.\n\nBut second, that is a naive attack, and does not take into account what I mentioned about IRL investigations.  Chainalysis is a tool, not the main process.\n\nIf someone tries to taint an address by depositing tainted BTC there, maybe a chainalysis tool would be confused and flag something.  Then a human law enforcement officer chases down humans in real life, extracts a key or two, IP addresses, subpoenas ISPs, etc etc, and someone somewhere has broken security and a part of the network is illuminated.  The fake taint is not a valid lead and is ignored.",

The majority of Canadians *should* be unaffected by this. But this is still early days and we don't know all the details of who and how many accounts are affected. technically anyone who donated to the truckers could have their accounts freezed.\n\nself custodied Bitcoin is unaffected to a large extent because of things like this https://bitcoiner.guide/privacy/",

Many countries are fencing off ways to invest to foreign stocks, for some citizens its even hard to open an account to buy shares and etfs in us markets. \n\nBut bitcoin can be purchased everywhere. \n\nAnd it's safer (look how they ripped off russians with their money invested to US), its quicker, there's no minimum account balance, even kyc can be avoided.\n\nSome would say \"just buy us dollars and that's it\". But Argentinians will cry on that advice... this is how btc is superior to other global markets.",
