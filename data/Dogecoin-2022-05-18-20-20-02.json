            "selftext": "Hello.  At the university, within the framework of one project, we considered  cryptocurrency. I decided to take such an aspect as ecology.\n\nWhy  did I choose this direction? In general, cryptocurrency and this whole  topic has been in the information field for a long time and often it all  comes down to government regulation or something like that, but few  people pay attention to the environmental problems associated with  mining, although even a superficial glance is enough to understand that  you can mine on renewable energy sources, but in this case the entry  threshold is higher.\n\nThe results of a small study in the video, I will be glad to hear your opinions and suggestions.\n\n[Mining and sustainable use of energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da0DAl9DE68)\n\nWhat\u2019s your thoughts?",

Or give warmongers any income from their clickbait.\n\nTwo things about mining\u2026\n\nFirstly, Doge uses AuxPoW, so our footprint is negligible, as we piggyback on LTC.\n\nSecondly, mining is a zero-sum, winner-take-all deal. Whether you have one miner or a billion, the rewards are exactly the same. But obviously the costs are vastly different.\n\nThe real environmental harm comes from the arms race and the greed that fuels it. The idea being to outdo the other guy to steal his slice of the rewards. And then he does the same, and so on and so forth.\n\nSadly, there\u2019s no real fix for this. Only falling prices will push rewards down so people quit mining. And as long as the hashpower doesn\u2019t drop far enough to make a 51% attack possible, that\u2019s the best we can hope for.",

Leaders can say or do what they please. But the people who pull the triggers are complicit and definitely not innocent.\n\nThe people who feel strongly that their principles matter have been abandoning the country in droves. And as they leave, the innocence of the ones who remain is diluted. You know what they say about people getting the governments they deserve, right?\n\nAnyway, politics aside, I\u2019m glad you gained something. I put quite a lot of time and effort into trying to educate people, and it often feels like a thankless task.",
