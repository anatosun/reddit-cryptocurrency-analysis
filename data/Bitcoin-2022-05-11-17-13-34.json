He's somewhere between an Elon Musk Twitter wannabe and a walmart version of Vitalik Buterin who thinks they've singlehandedly fixed finance.\n\nDo Kwon massively, massively overleveraged himself in Bitcoin to keep his stablecoin, UST, pegged to the dollar, despite there being plenty of other coins that already do that. When everyone realizes he's selling shit covered in frosting and stop funding him, his shitcoin tanked. In order to prevent his initial investors and preminers from cutting his head off, he liquidated $150 BILLION dollars of Bitcoin to convince the world he's not as retarded as he actually is. Who knows how much of his stack of LUNA he sold at the peak while everyone else he brought into his cult on Twitter held his bags as the coin dropped 70%.\n\nAbsolute rugpull. Same as *every single fucking time* any shitcoin gets too powerful. A tale as old as time. \n\nFuck this guy. Fuck shitcoins. Fuck people who overleverage. He brought an entire industry into a bear market off his stupid fucking ponzi scheme for gullible idiots looking to get rich quick.",

Push out smaller competitions and forces consumers to spend more.\n\nThese companies then make you think that its still a free market and what their doing is fair and you still have freedom of choice while they already control everything. I mean ask yourself why is it ok for corporations to own media companies as well?\n\nThe opposite of corporate capitalism doesn't have to be socialism. You just need a fair government that doesn't take bribes and punishes those that tries to manipulate the market.",

I dont have time for this and i shouldnt be questioned about what I want to do with MY Money\u2026.oh to top it all off the wire still isn\u2019t completed because of some accounting error at the bank\u2026..idc anyway im cancelling it tomorrow.

            "selftext": "Just few days ago a friend panicked because Bitcoin and his \"diversified portfolio\" went down like crazy, and so did tech stocks. He's basically hiding under his blanket, not knowing where to go, helpless, and not being able to function well (he is heavily invested). Same with a friend who owns half a million in Bitcoin.\n\n*All while I am secretly hoping to keep buying cheap.*\n\nI'm quite new to the space, but I am frankly surprised how much others who have been through worse freak out so often. For us n00bs who just got in this year, I feel it's extremely important that if you are heavily invested in Bitcoin, from time to time follow the exercise of thinking what to do if Bitcoin hit an all-time low in an extremely short time, to the point that one would feel like \"all is lost\".\n\nI am NOT saying that Bitcoin is going to zero. In fact I believe the opposite. I hold almost no fiat anymore. But it may go low enough, for long enough (or fast enough) for many people to panic into thinking this is going to happen, and sell at an incredible loss.\n\nSo here's the exercise I do often when I am having negative thoughts (if you never have negative thoughts you shouldn't be here, becoming the reincarnation of Buddha is far more profitable that Bitcoin).\n\nAlright, here I go:\n\n***Why am I invested in Bitcoin?***\n\nObviously I want huge, or at least a positive ROI (and anyone who tells you they don't is lying) but this won't happen overnight, so I spend about one or two hours every day reading books about Bitcoin, tech articles, and pure Computer Science math. This shit is hard, I often want to ragequit.\n\nI have nightmares with elliptic curves or mnemonic seed words. But I remind myself the reasons why I believe Bitcoin can bring a big change to the world. No one knows how positive it can be but we can rest assured that the current fiat system is absolute crap for the 99% of us, so the bar is set very low.\n\n***If I lost all my money (Bitcoin suddenly disappears, someone steals my keys or points a gun at my wife and tells me he knows how much I have and expects nothing less), what happens?***\n\nI have a stable job, pays well enough so that I can start stacking again or getting my savings back in place. I have two children, so I need to take finances seriously. We have great social security.\n\nIt would be a very shitty situation, but it won't be life or death. I'll be able to perform normally after a weeks.\n\nI don't own a house, a car, and the most expensive thing on our rental apartment is a US $1,000 sofa that we bought (I might sell it for Bitcoin, wife might get really pissed though).\n\nI don't have any debt, stock, bonds, and my last CD (3% interest rate lol) is expiring soon -- as soon as it does it's going to my Bitcoin stack.\n\n***If Bitcoin crashes for long enough to make me doubt, would I feel it's still worth it?***\n\nHell yeah. All the learning has put me on a higher level as a software developer: cryptography, math, security, privacy, anonymity, reading about countless hacks, best-practices, etc. I am learning rare and valuable skills, that can let me find great jobs with lots of flexibility like the one I have now.\n\nIf you're in Bitcoin for the wrong reasons, you might leave for the wrong reasons, and leave in the deep red.\n\nLet's face it, if Bitcoin crashes, our chart-reading skills won't transfer into a well-paying job (alright alright, unless you live in Manhattan).\n\nEnjoy your morning/afternoon coffee, or make some guacamole to dip your chips!",

Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 8.3 percent before seasonal adjustment.\n\n Increases in the indexes for shelter, food, airline fares, and new vehicles were the largest contributors to the seasonally adjusted all items increase. The food index rose 0.9 percent over the month as the food at home index rose 1.0 percent. The energy index declined in April after rising in recent months. The index for gasoline fell 6.1 percent over the month, offsetting increases in the indexes for natural gas and electricity.   \n\nThe index for all items less food and energy rose 0.6 percent in April following a 0.3-percent advance in March. Along with indexes for shelter, airline fares, and new vehicles, the indexes for medical care, recreation, and household furnishings and operations all increased in April. The indexes for apparel, communication, and used cars and trucks all declined over the month.\n\n  The all items index increased 8.3 percent for the 12 months ending April, a smaller increase than the 8.5-percent figure for the period ending in March. The all items less food and energy index rose 6.2 percent over the last 12 months. The energy index rose 30.3 percent over the last year, and the food index increased 9.4 percent, the largest 12-month increase since the period",

But at the end of the day, whenever you lay your money on the line in hopes of growing it via increased perception of value, you have made a bet. And that is not meant to sound like a bad thing. There is nothing wrong with making a bet. It's all about the odds and the payout. I personally made a bet on Bitcoin because the potential upside is enormous. The chance to reinvent money only comes along every thousand years or so. It may even be more rare than that. But I always kept in the back of my mind that I may lose it all. That I may in fact be the equivalent of a 17th century tulip speculator. I was never so arrogant as to dismiss that possibility. You cannot always HODL your way to victory. Everyone else in the world gets a vote as well. So I risked an mount of money I am comfortable losing completely. But it's also an amount of money that will make me very, very happy if BTC becomes the coin of the realm. So...let's see what happens. I've got time.",

I wish someone had told me this during the last bear market.\n\nAnyways, Here's my strategy for the next 2 years:\n\n1.) DCA into BTC with $40 every day which comes down to $1200/month and $28800 in two years\n\n2.) Assuming BTC price ranges between $30k- $50K for the next 2 years I am assuming my avg. buy price during this period will be $40K which means I will have stacked 0.72 BTC during this period\n\n3.) The next BTC bull market will kick in after 30th March 2024 (ETA date of halving). I am expecting the BTC price to range between $150k - $300k  at the peak of the next bull run\n\n4.) This will place my above investment of $28800 somewhere between $108k - $218k by Dec 2025\n\n5.) DCA is a great way to beat the volatility and invest with peace of mind\n\nNeedless to say that all the above calculations can change heavily based on BTC price movements and no one knows what BTC's price will be in the future.\n\nWhat are you guys planning to do?\n\nKeep stacking fellas!

He's somewhere between an Elon Musk Twitter wannabe and a walmart version of Vitalik Buterin who thinks *they've* singlehandedly fixed finance.\n\nDo Kwon massively, massively overleveraged himself in Bitcoin to keep his stablecoin, UST, pegged to the dollar, *despite there being plenty of other coins that already do that.* When everyone realizes he's selling shit covered in frosting and stop funding him, his shitcoin tanked. In order to prevent his initial investors and preminers from cutting his head off, he liquidated $150 BILLION dollars of Bitcoin to convince the world he's not as retarded as he actually is. Who knows how much of his stack of TerraLuna he sold at the peak while everyone else he brought into his cult on Twitter held his bags as the coin dropped 70%.\n\nFuck this guy. Fuck shitcoins. Fuck people who overleverage. He brought an entire industry into a bear market off his stupid fucking ponzi scheme for gullible idiots looking to get rich quick.",

I ended up buying Odroid HC4 and it is easily available. \n\nThe good part it, you don't have to shell out lot of money for this setup. \n\nI found a great guide written by an amazing soul to help you.\n\nhttps://mutatrum.com/installing-umbrel-on-an-odroid-hc4/\n\nYou can follow it and have yourself the BTC node up and running.\n\nIf you have any doubts related to this.

Starting from 2024, the Ministry of Commerce and the Department of Homeland Security may publish the approved algorithms that are ready to be phased out and easily cracked by quantum computers on a yearly basis. The 10th National Security Memorandum of the White House will drive all cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, to adopt digital signature algorithms that are resistant to quantum computer cracking. There are only three kinds of digital signature algorithms that can resist quantum computer cracking, all of which have their own advantages. For example, lattice digital signature will be the algorithm standard in the United States; Hash function signature is the safest in mathematical theory; Multi-variable digital signature has the shortest signature length.

Similar to how Bitcoin fanatics may be bombastically optimistic on Bitcoin based on little reason. All I know is many people have gotten rich of Bitcoin and I\u2019m not opposed to trying to get a small fortune out of it myself. Whether Bitcoin will be mass adopted or fiat will become null and void in our lifetime or even ever, there is still money to be made off Bitcoin, and anyone who denies that much is just a hardheaded individual determined to hate.",
