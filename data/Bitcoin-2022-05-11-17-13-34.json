            "selftext": "Just few days ago a friend panicked because Bitcoin and his \"diversified portfolio\" went down like crazy, and so did tech stocks. He's basically hiding under his blanket, not knowing where to go, helpless, and not being able to function well (he is heavily invested). Same with a friend who owns half a million in Bitcoin.\n\n*All while I am secretly hoping to keep buying cheap.*\n\nI'm quite new to the space, but I am frankly surprised how much others who have been through worse freak out so often. For us n00bs who just got in this year, I feel it's extremely important that if you are heavily invested in Bitcoin, from time to time follow the exercise of thinking what to do if Bitcoin hit an all-time low in an extremely short time, to the point that one would feel like \"all is lost\".\n\nI am NOT saying that Bitcoin is going to zero. In fact I believe the opposite. I hold almost no fiat anymore. But it may go low enough, for long enough (or fast enough) for many people to panic into thinking this is going to happen, and sell at an incredible loss.\n\nSo here's the exercise I do often when I am having negative thoughts (if you never have negative thoughts you shouldn't be here, becoming the reincarnation of Buddha is far more profitable that Bitcoin).\n\nAlright, here I go:\n\n***Why am I invested in Bitcoin?***\n\nObviously I want huge, or at least a positive ROI (and anyone who tells you they don't is lying) but this won't happen overnight, so I spend about one or two hours every day reading books about Bitcoin, tech articles, and pure Computer Science math. This shit is hard, I often want to ragequit.\n\nI have nightmares with elliptic curves or mnemonic seed words. But I remind myself the reasons why I believe Bitcoin can bring a big change to the world. No one knows how positive it can be but we can rest assured that the current fiat system is absolute crap for the 99% of us, so the bar is set very low.\n\n***If I lost all my money (Bitcoin suddenly disappears, someone steals my keys or points a gun at my wife and tells me he knows how much I have and expects nothing less), what happens?***\n\nI have a stable job, pays well enough so that I can start stacking again or getting my savings back in place. I have two children, so I need to take finances seriously. We have great social security.\n\nIt would be a very shitty situation, but it won't be life or death. I'll be able to perform normally after a weeks.\n\nI don't own a house, a car, and the most expensive thing on our rental apartment is a US $1,000 sofa that we bought (I might sell it for Bitcoin, wife might get really pissed though).\n\nI don't have any debt, stock, bonds, and my last CD (3% interest rate lol) is expiring soon -- as soon as it does it's going to my Bitcoin stack.\n\n***If Bitcoin crashes for long enough to make me doubt, would I feel it's still worth it?***\n\nHell yeah. All the learning has put me on a higher level as a software developer: cryptography, math, security, privacy, anonymity, reading about countless hacks, best-practices, etc. I am learning rare and valuable skills, that can let me find great jobs with lots of flexibility like the one I have now.\n\nIf you're in Bitcoin for the wrong reasons, you might leave for the wrong reasons, and leave in the deep red.\n\nLet's face it, if Bitcoin crashes, our chart-reading skills won't transfer into a well-paying job (alright alright, unless you live in Manhattan).\n\nEnjoy your morning/afternoon coffee, or make some guacamole to dip your chips!",

There is nothing wrong with making a bet. It's all about the odds and the payout. I personally made a bet on Bitcoin because the potential upside is enormous. The chance to reinvent money only comes along every thousand years or so. It may even be more rare than that. But I always kept in the back of my mind that I may lose it all. That I may in fact be the equivalent of a 17th century tulip speculator. I was never so arrogant as to dismiss that possibility. You cannot always HODL your way to victory. Everyone else in the world gets a vote as well. So I risked an mount of money I am comfortable losing completely. But it's also an amount of money that will make me very, very happy if BTC becomes the coin of the realm. So...let's see what happens. I've got time.",

In order to prevent his initial investors and preminers from cutting his head off, he liquidated $150 BILLION dollars of Bitcoin to convince the world he's not as retarded as he actually is. Who knows how much of his stack of TerraLuna he sold at the peak while everyone else he brought into his cult on Twitter held his bags as the coin dropped 70%.\n\nFuck this guy. Fuck shitcoins. Fuck people who overleverage. He brought an entire industry into a bear market off his stupid fucking ponzi scheme for gullible idiots looking to get rich quick.",

There is clear shortage of Raspberry Pi 4 for quite a while now. \n\nI knew I can't wait for it, so I ended up looking for RPi 4 alternative. I ended up buying Odroid HC4 and it is easily available. \n\nThe good part it, you don't have to shell out lot of money for this setup. \n\nI found a great guide written by an amazing soul to help you.\n\nhttps://mutatrum.com/installing-umbrel-on-an-odroid-hc4/\n\nYou can follow it and have yourself the BTC node up and running.\n\nIf you have any doubts related to this. Let me know also.",

Starting from 2024, the Ministry of Commerce and the Department of Homeland Security may publish the approved algorithms that are ready to be phased out and easily cracked by quantum computers on a yearly basis. The 10th National Security Memorandum of the White House will drive all cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, to adopt digital signature algorithms that are resistant to quantum computer cracking. There are only three kinds of digital signature algorithms that can resist quantum computer cracking, all of which have their own advantages. For example, lattice digital signature will be the algorithm standard in the United States; Hash function signature is the safest in mathematical theory; Multi-variable digital signature has the shortest signature length. So, what algorithm will Bitcoin use to resist quantum computer cracking?",

They recently raised rates to 0.25%, then double-raised to 0.75%, and are expected to raise rates another five or six times this year, and continue to do so until inflation goes down\n3. When rates are high, government bonds (which are considered the safest thing to invest in because if the government collapses suddenly you're probably fucked regardless) give higher returns\n4. Rich investors take some of the money they're putting into risky investments (like crypto) into bonds because bonds are more profitable\n5. Thus, inflation is bad for crypto because the federal reserve tools to fight inflation make people want to invest less into crypto (indeed, to invest into *anything.* That's the point of raising interest rates: to take money out of the economy by encouraging investors to tie it up in bonds)\n6. The April inflation report came out today, showing an 8.2% inflation rate. This is actually down somewhat from March, but still super high\n7. Because inflation remains high, investors think the fed is more likely to double-raise to 1.25% instead of single raising to 1%, or possibly even triple-raising to 1.50%.\n8. This makes them want to get out of riskier investments and grab bonds early while they're cheaper, so they sell crypto for bonds.\n\nBasically, despite the commonly-cited meme of bitcoin as an inflation hedge, high inflation is actually really bad for crypto because it leads to high interest rates which discourage investment.\n\nIf you think the fed will get inflation under control and then start lowering rates, Bitcoin might still be a good long term investment. If you think the interest rate is going to have to go all the way up to like 8%, it's maybe not a great investment in the short-to-medium term. Investment is, of course, gambling on the future, so its up to you what your risk profile is. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose, etc.",

Those guys like computers. Computers function on pure logic, so they need something to judge asset prices on based on pure logic. Enter statistical analysis. Also, enter the Math PHDs, because who the hell else does statistics.\n\nHedge funds also do not wait around for things to go x100 or x200. They will sell it to you at x50, buy it back later at a lower price, and then sell it to you again at x40, because they can do that several times and make more money. Also, PHDs don't like outsize standard deviations from the mean, they program their toys to sell (and/or buy) that stuff way before they get to that kind of extreme.\n\nNothing is off. We just don't get to trade with each other any longer. The PHDs are here. Good news might be they treat dips and crashes the same way.\n\nUsually.\n\nAdd in the threat of higher interest  rates from the FED, and everything is doing pretty much exactly what it should.",

The money was chanted into existence through quantitative easing, government bond buying and (near) zero interest rate policies almost exclusively benefitted governments and the wealthy.\n\nThese trillions have first fuelled stock prices that went ballistic and kept going up relentlessly even during a economically highly disruptive global pandemic. Higher incomes and the wealthy were able to benefit most by taking on more debt using their existing assets or income projections as collateral, enabling them to buy properties or other assets while paying zero interest. Now, as price inflation begins to set in their debts are conveniently getting inflated away.\n\nAnd so the wealth gap grows. Similar mechanisms at the level of countries are at play as well.\n\nThe coming years will be painful. Continuous price inflation should normally be countered by increasing interest rates, but highly indebted countries put a limit to that. It doesn\u2019t matter either way \u2014 lower interest rates translates to higher price inflation while higher interest rates may dampen price inflation but will increase either taxes or government debt, because the debt payments increase at higher rates.\n\nEither way, pensioners and wage earners without hard assets such as real estate will start to see their buying power vaporize, their savings erode while taxes increase. It\u2019s untenable, and this won\u2019t end well.",

The main culprits for our current spike in inflation is supply disruption and labour shortages, as well as shifts in demand patterns from services to goods, which can\u2019t easily be scaled up. The Great Resignation has caused the supply of Labour to fall whilst demand has increased, resulting in increased bargaining power of workers to demand a higher wage, passed on to consumers as part of a wage-price spiral. Yes, in certain industries and depending on the power of firms they may be able to benefit from higher prices, however they do not need to blame \u201cinflation\u201d for this: it is simply then producing and selling at a price they believe will increase profits, however most firms in such industries face strict competition policy. If prices went down, there would be a crisis, such as the one seen in 2007-2008, where a crash in stock market and house prices drove asset prices falling. Subsequent fire sales then resulted in severe deleveraging and bank panics causing liquidity problems. Inflation does not equal bad, even if Bob down the pub talking drunken rubbish told you it is. A cost of living crisis, which we experience now, is bad. Not inflation. Moderate and consistent (around 2%) inflation is necessary",

The price of everything has gone up. Lowering the costs of products because it's cheaper to produce things (like the video suggests) would make things even worse.",

I think most people hit an age where they realize it's impossible at some level to expect humans not to exploit their power and money is the ultimate form of power.

I think not.\n\nI think humans are going to continue to progress technologically and crypto will be incorporated into the whole financial system over time. I do think old people will need to die and young people will need to become adults. I hate to offend you but you come off as someone over 65 if the only good you see from Bitcoin is holding.\n\nI see 1 piece of a massive technological revolution that will end with a decentralalized government and financial system in something hopefully approaching technological utopia.\n\nWe as a species are shedding the skin of old systems that were needed before the technological revolution. And as technology progresses hanging on to their remnants will continue showing their ease of abuse.\n\nOur elections are not for representatives any more they are for actors funded by corporations who pretend to act on our interest.\n\nOur financial system is equally corrupt.\n\nIt boggles my mind how obtuse some people choose to be \n\nI understand if you are trying not to fomo or keep some kind of even perspective. But you should try learning to hold multiple opinions in your head and then project into the future and see what is more likely under which scenarios.  If technology continues to expand I think it's pretty obvious the US dollar isn't going to be around in 100 years.. 1000 years.. 10000 years...

This penalizes early holders that have to withstand the volatility.

I was especially interested in the upward moves of course. I started to study and learn about it.\n\nIn July 2020 I bought my first serious lump sum amount of Bitcoin at a price of around 9k.

When everyone realizes he's selling shit covered in frosting and stop funding him, his shitcoin tanked. In order to prevent his initial investors and preminers from cutting his head off, he liquidated $150 BILLION dollars of Bitcoin to convince the world he's not as retarded as he actually is. Who knows how much of his stack of LUNA he sold at the peak while everyone else he brought into his cult on Twitter held his bags as the coin dropped 70%.\n\nAbsolute rugpull. Same as *every single fucking time* any shitcoin gets too powerful. A tale as old as time. \n\nFuck this guy. Fuck shitcoins. Fuck people who overleverage.

Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 8.3 percent before seasonal adjustment.\n\n Increases in the indexes for shelter, food, airline fares, and new vehicles were the largest contributors to the seasonally adjusted all items increase. The food index rose 0.9 percent over the month as the food at home index rose 1.0 percent. The energy index declined in April after rising in recent months. The index for gasoline fell 6.1 percent over the month, offsetting increases in the indexes for natural gas and electricity.   \n\nThe index for all items less food and energy rose 0.6 percent in April following a 0.3-percent advance in March. Along with indexes for shelter, airline fares, and new vehicles, the indexes for medical care, recreation, and household furnishings and operations all increased in April. The indexes for apparel, communication, and used cars and trucks all declined over the month.\n\n  The all items index increased 8.3 percent for the 12 months ending April, a smaller increase than the 8.5-percent figure for the period ending in March. The all items less food and energy index rose 6.2 percent over the last 12 months. The energy index rose 30.3 percent over the last year, and the food index increased 9.4 percent, the largest 12-month increase since the period",

I wish someone had told me this during the last bear market.\n\nAnyways, Here's my strategy for the next 2 years:\n\n1.) DCA into BTC with $40 every day which comes down to $1200/month and $28800 in two years\n\n2.) Assuming BTC price ranges between $30k- $50K for the next 2 years I am assuming my avg. buy price during this period will be $40K which means I will have stacked 0.72 BTC during this period\n\n3.) The next BTC bull market will kick in after 30th March 2024 (ETA date of halving). I am expecting the BTC price to range between $150k - $300k  at the peak of the next bull run\n\n4.) This will place my above investment of $28800 somewhere between $108k - $218k by Dec 2025\n\n5.) DCA is a great way to beat the volatility and invest with peace of mind\n\nNeedless to say that all the above calculations can change heavily based on BTC price movements and no one knows what BTC's price will be in the future.\n\nWhat are you guys planning to do?\n\nKeep stacking fellas! Sending good vibes to everyone here.",

And because it updates every minute it feels like my only option was to wait for it to update to a number I liked. Which again was like once a minute. I\u2019m still learning myself. Like it would say 26,700 on Robinhood and go to coin base and it would say 26,100 for example. And then I\u2019d wait for it yo update and then it STILL doesn\u2019t show the numbers I saw and continue to see on Robinhood. I\u2019m not quite sure why or what\u2019s that about. But buying and selling on coinbase I will say is pretty spot on. If you click buy/sell, it buys/sells IMMEDIATELY and I mean immediately and you get whatever the price was in that exact second.",

This seed can be translated into a human-friendly form as a sequence of 12, 18 or 24 words. With this sequence of words, you can restore access to your funds on any wallet (hardware or software) that supports this standard, also called BIP39.\n\nSo you could, for example, buy a Trezor wallet and at some later point restore your access on a Ledger wallet. Or the other way around. Or you could restore it on a purely software wallet (note that doing so negates the security advantages of hardware wallets).\n\nThis recovery phrase is the key to the castle. So you need to keep it safe and secure. But with it, you're protected from anything happening to your hardware wallet or the company that made it.",

In fact, it means not using a centralized exchange at all. There are decentralized options out there which do not have custody of your funds in any step of the process (like Bisq).\n\nPeople who buy Bitcoin but keep it on Coinbase still have a centralized mentality.

We acknowledge your concern of being unable to send crypto and we're here to assist.\r  \n\r  \nYour account is temporarily suspended from sending cryptocurrency off the Coinbase platform. This is to protect against loss, because after funds are sent off our platform, we have no way to reverse those transactions.\r  \n\r  \nThis feature will not be re-enabled until May 13, 2022 at the earliest. The current restrictions on your account mean that you must first convert your crypto to fiat and then withdraw the fiat funds to your verified bank account.\r  \n\r  \nDigital currency accounts can be a target for potential scams. The only information a merchant, vendor, or seller would properly request is the receiving address for your wallet. Anyone asking for other account information, such as your account's password or 2-step verification codes, is likely a scammer.\r  \n\r  \nPlease also beware of \"investment opportunities.\" Any service that asks you to send crypto to an external wallet address in order to receive returns on an investment is probably a scam.\r  \n\r  \nDigital currency transactions are irreversible.

Obviously Bitcoin has no such insurance.\n\nEvery exchange or bitcoin holding institution, including Robinhood, is subject to the exact same thing.
