You need to have the key in order to have the wallet and the coins it contains.\n\nHD extends this, by having each of the parent keys generate a set of child keys on a derivation path. Literally billions of them. And because they are derived, then possession of the master is enough to recover all of them.\n\nThe problem is though, that unlike normal wallets, there really is no way to peek inside the magic black box. So if there is an error in the code, as happened with Dough, then the actual derivation path may not be what you thought it was. And that makes all the wallets impossible to recover. People have tried to brute force it, and checked billions of candidates, without success. You can read about it over on /r/dogecoindev if you like.\n\nWhen \u2018normal\u2019 clients use additional wallets, such as the change wallets when UTXOs are partially spent, they are not random at all. They are chosen from a pre-generated list of wallets which were generated the first time the client was run. Core for example, generates a set of a hundred wallets, and you can see this for yourself by running DUMPWALLET on a brand new installation. There will be a single named wallet and 99 reserves in the output file.",
