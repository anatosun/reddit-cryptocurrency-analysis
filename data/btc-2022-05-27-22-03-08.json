People can send you assets directly to your LNS address. App has a lot of customization options like changing your avatar, adding social media, creating decentralized websites and much more. \n\nOther than that, ecosystem is still growing but you can find a great variety of DEXes. MistSwap being the one taking the lead imo. (has the highest APR's and a god tier bridge).\n\nbtw I'm a big fan of your work, hope u doing good!",
