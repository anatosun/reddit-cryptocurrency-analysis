            "selftext": "Inflation is a symptom of a bigger disease called central banking and unfortunately, as I post this, bitcoin is still tied to and valued in fiat currency. While people still invest in bitcoin hoping to cash out for fiat, you can be sure bitcoin will not decouple from fiat currency, and you'll see the \"value\" of it move with other markets tied to fiat (although we all know the real value is priceless)\n\n\nWe know the central banking system is collapsing. The ship is sinking and they cannot keep it afloat much longer. Decades of manipulation and Bipolar policy has damaged fiat beyond repair. It's going to zero, as it has in many areas of the world already. When you buy bitcoin you should understand you're betting against the central banks. You're betting against fiat currency altogether. You're expressing your desire to see this decentralized monetary system become the standard, so you should expect to have to hold for a decade or several decades to see the vision come true. Once the fiat currency system finally collapses for good (and it will) your Bitcoin will be the only life raft you have. It will be the only life raft anyone has, and then you'll see everything else valued in satoshis. \n\n\nDo you think the world is going back to trading physical gold when fiat finally collapses? I don't think so. In today's world technology is important and convenience. The world will choose bitcoin when central banking dies. Get on the boat and don't sell your bitcoin for any shitcoins especially the ultimate shitcoin USD.",

If i sound ignorant its because im not well informed , i only went into bitcoin because i was winning casino online etc and thought of it as a quick way to get my money . So is it worth holding onto 10 k bitcoin hypothetically to see an increase in value or if its just  10 k usd then might as well cashout since its not a lot of money  ? What are your thoughts ?",

It was designed to cure the disease (if the world could agree and adopt it peacefully). We probably won't see bitcoin cure the disease in the most peaceful and least painful way because governments and banks are certainly fighting to produce anti bitcoin propaganda and the general public is easily convinced. We will probably see bitcoin become the AED machine when our global economy dies from the fiat system. Then it will remain and be proven to be the cure we had needed all along.",

It seems like you're saying bitcoin has no solution for small transactions, which we agree would be paramount for global adoption in the case of USD, EUR (fiat system) collapse. In this case we do have lightning network and the transactions are nearly instantaneous now and fees are much lower. \n\n\nAs far as your point about minting coins out of silver and gold, we again bring in trust. Now we must trust the mint to be honest and not make fake coins or purposely skim weight to enrich their own pockets. When we compare that to the fact bitvoin cannot be faked or skimmed or diluted in any way, we clearly see bitcoin is superior in that regard.",

In that case I'd say it's not wise to think this monetary system can't go away. As humanity has progressed and become more advanced we've seen multiple monetary system replacements. They dont really happen overnight or instantly (perhaps you think I'm suggesting that's what will happen). It's always a gradual shift mixed with tragedy or genocide or revolt to help force us over the line to adopt the new system. \n\n\nIf you think I'm suggesting fiat is going to collapse one day suddenly and we will wake up to a total failure, that's not what I'm saying. I do believe it will totrally fail and BTC will eventually replace it completely but it will happen in stages like it always has. Unfortunately I do think the biggest phase of adoption will come with some major pain for many people with a large crash. We will see many red flags and black swan events and maybe even war and oppression before it finally pushes us over the line to full adoption.",

If there is a major war and a lot of miners have to shut down what will happen is the difficulty will go down drastically, so it will become easier for the small miner to find blocks. It's one of the amazing features of bitcoin. Also the network is not \"run\" by the miners as many think. You don't have to mine bitcoin to keep the network running. The nodes are the real boss of the network and if they are running we can transact on the network and do not need new supply constantly coming in from mining just to use the network. As a bonus on top of all that, realizing the nodes are actually the most important part of the network, another amazing feature of bitcoin is how you can run a node on a very basic computer. You don't need ASIC to run a btc node.",

I do believe there will be a painful final event which will bring us to the final stage of bitcoin adoption, but mainly because the anti btc propaganda works well on people who dont bother to do their own research and learn what btc is. Sadly people are not going to fully adopt until they have to. History has shown us this. When we adopted new monetary systems it was due to conflict and oppression and the need for inmovation to solve prpblems. We are in that same scenario today. We have major problems and corrupt people holding our wealth hostage. Those governments and bankers aren't going down without a fight to the death. They'll definitely be bringing down some no coiners and probably institutions and maybe even entire governments with them.",

Every time DXY goes parabolic bitcoin gets killed, like every.single.time. Once DXY's rise gets tempered , Bitcoin's behavior gets tempered as well.\n\nAlso every time the DXY gets dumped hard, Bitcoin gets in a rally. Look how well Bitcoin's rally parallels that of dollars' competitors. It seems to rally every time Euro does, nothing to do with halving or whatever. I always look for Euro to bottom against the dollar and then start accumulating BTC like crazy (I am accumulating rn, there is some chance that the Euro bottomed).\n\nBuying/selling bitcoin is akin to buying/selling forex on margin, without the fear of liquidation, which is why I prefer it to forex. No need to play options when the real thing can be as volatile and present as many opportunities.\n\nAlso, the central banking is \"collapsing\" ever since Nixon got us off the gold standard. And while that may be true, these things happen slowly, do not go about your life thinking that such a collapse is imminent, it has been \"imminent\" for 50 years +... Obviously it will collapse, I just don't think that you should put much bank in it happening in our lifetimes...",
