If this exceeds issuance, then you have yourself deflation. So if the network is highly utilised, then it is likely as you will have a greater amount of fees (with issuance being predictable).\n\n>As in capped production?\n\nNo. Ethereum operates with a minimum necessary issuance policy, which is best described as the minimum issuance required without sacrificing security. This is dynamic, but as outlined above still enables deflation.\n\nProjected issuance looks like this [https://docs.ethhub.io/assets/images/issuance_graph.png](https://docs.ethhub.io/assets/images/issuance_graph.png)\n\nThrow in the fact that net issuance can actually be negative when transaction fees are burned under EIP-1559 you get deflation and something that looks like this - [https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1352734923703123968?s=21](https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1352734923703123968?s=21)",

But it's not exactly deflationary. It's rather very dynamic, allowing stakers to get more ETH when needed and to get less ETH when not. I expect the quantity of ETH to adapt to market needs with time (though it will be quite slow).",

This infrastructure can be manifested in financial markets, governance, or other models. As societies scale new forms of handling coordination are needed. Ethereum represents a new form of doing so in a world shaped by a globally connected internet.\n\nEthereum allows the manipulation of value, which allows the management of risk across people and time to preserve and build capital. Be it social, financial or cultural capital. In the financial sense, the programmable modeling and manipulation of value allows for the recreation of finance which solves age old economic needs. \n\nSince it\u2019s programmable, Ethereum can model any subset of traditional financial applications, and expands what is possible to a greater unexplored superset of value manipulation activities. Unconstrained, Ethereum allows new types of \u201cgames\u201d to be played with money, say a system where for every transaction, the supply increases quadratically. Contact with the real world will make some unexplored games and new types of markets more useful than others.\n\nA manifestation of this is DeFi, decentralized finance, where modern financial activities have been commodified and modeled on the network. Open, permission-less modification allows for rapid experimentation leading to new types of in the unexplored superset, financial applications like flash loans, no loss lotteries and quadratic markets.\n\nThis is a great podcast which also defines crypto economics which is the basis of the network:\nhttps://youtu.be/ycK3AUTdl1w\n\nCrypto economics can be defined as the usage of cryptography and economics to ensure trust minimized systems. Note there is probably a better articulated definition than this. \n\nWhen you can use cryptography use it. If cryptography cannot assure security properties, go a level up and use game theory and economic incentives to ensure collaboration. A common application of this is using cryptography to ensure the gardening of the blockchain. But using economics incentives to incentivize consensus of which is the correct chain aka the correct objective reality. Cryptography can give assertions in stateless world, but once time is introduce and state is necessary, we need consensus to all agree on what happens in the next state transition.",

E.g. defi protocols.\n* It is important because you use it to run protocols on Ethereum\n\n* Benefits of holding: holding and not using, the economics suggests that the value of ETH can increase\n\n* Potential of it: look at the amount of money and growth rate of users and money deposited into the ETH network as a whole, more people are using ETH to transact. Also, more institutional funds are allowing people to invest in ETH as an investment product\n\n* Decentralised global computer: yes that is the goal. You have apps on your android. You have apps on ETH.\n\n\n[Video explainer for 101 beginners](https://youtu.be/z23g0AJyOFo)",

Get on crypto twitter, follow bankless, sassal0x, hasu, follow the people they follow.\n\nEth is the most trustless asset in the ethereum network, you can use it as collateral to take out a loan (like you may use your house as collateral to get more loan in a bank) only here you take out the loan without permission from anyone. \n\nyou need it for paying for transactions\n\nyou can stake it on eth2 and earn around 10% interest right now, will go lower than that but it will still be alot better than anything you can find in traditional finance\n\nthe potential of ethereum as i personally see it is almost endless, anyone with an idea can build on top of it and integrate into ethereum. \n\nWhere ever you are in the world, you can transact with anyone, without restrictions. \n\nIts revolutionary",
