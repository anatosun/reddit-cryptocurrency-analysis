ETH forks quite regularly on each upgrade it applies. That's pretty weak rationale. Got anything better?\n\n> Also because a vitalik has written many arguments about it, and because rollups are basically the accepted scaling solution right now\n\nSharding replaces one problem with another:\n- it is known that sharding creates UX issues when getting state from shards which your contract is not part of. Txs require waiting a certain number of confirmations until the proof from the other contract is included on your contract's shard.\n- in some designs, sharding prevents more than one transaction form a wallet/key from being included in the same block to protect the same state from being manipulated from two different shards.\n\nSo anyone can make claims like this, but there are still a lot of unknowns which need to be explored.",

What matters is bringing real hard money cash transactions to the greatest number of people possible, allowing any two people to perform casual transactions with no need of a financial intermediary.\n\nLimiting the number of users who can access the system in order to minimize the cost of independent archival nodes is ridiculous.\n\nWhy on earth should we limit Bitcoin to the needs of hobbyists? You don't even need a full archival node to verify transactions. If that was a requirement, nobody would have ever taken Bitcoin seriously to begin with.",

The first is consensus parameters (rules of the blockchain). The second is censorship of transactions. L2 does not have control of consensus of the main base chain, so centralization of L2 only leaves the censorship as a potential issue.\n\nLightning nodes and channels are largely centralized yes. However, if there ever were a censorship problem, it is possible for p2p users to create their own liquidity channels with each other. So even if a large portion of nodes are centralized, the ability still remains for users to put in a little extra effort to get around it. Or in the most extreme cases, you can always still go use the decentralized base chain to move money without censorship.\n\nAs long as the base chain stays decentralized, the consensus of the network remains protected. That is the most important thing. You can\u2019t have some centralized group decide to increase BTC cap to 50million or whatever.",

While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.\n\n> What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.",
