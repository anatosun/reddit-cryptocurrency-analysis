I've seen Monero and Railgun especially talk about it, and now it's time to put it into practice, I suppose, because, as the usual saying goes, privacy is something that all humans naturally appreciate, and even those who refuse it to others expect it for themselves.",

Good Railgun just launched its V1.on Ethereum, BSC, and PLygon mainet. Let's see how it will all turn out to be.",

It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s attractive and I get that.\n\nHowever, focusing on that and ENTIRELY forgetting about graphics, storyline, and game mechanics is very counterproductive.\n\nA couple 100 dollars from a game are cool but I don\u2019t think that alone they\u2019re enough to get people to move over from gaming consoles to P2E games.\n\nI just don\u2019t see enough development honestly. By far the only chain that has some good games is Polygon. Aavegotchi is pretty entertaining and their token\u2019s price has been holding up amazingly compared to all other coins and tokens on the market. Arc8 is also designed in a way that makes it pretty addictive with some pretty good gaming mechanics. It also helps that Polygon has one of the most efficient VMs making these NFT pretty profitable.\n\nSo while there are a couple of exceptions, the vast majority of P2E games become literal clones and developers don\u2019t seem too keen on providing more entertainment to these games.\n\nIf these devs keep up this pace then the P2E market will slowly start losing interest among the masses and that would be a huge blow for the metaverse and crypto as a whole.",
