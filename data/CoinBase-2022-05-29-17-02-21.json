However, if you tap in to the currency you sent from the **Coins** tab and then tap into the transaction in question, there should be an option to view your transaction on its respective block explorer.\n\nHappy to answer any further questions you may have!",

I've exchanged coins for others, then back to Ethereum ... and I want to be sure I'm tracking gains and losses. It seems very difficult to do from what I'm seeing in the CB Wallet app. Can I get transaction sells/conversions history with pricing somewhere? If not, why not? Thank you u/coinbasesupport",
