But in a deflationary economic order (where bitcoin network is base layer) you should diversify less. The reason for this in theory is because bitcoin should produce an abundance of goods and services OUTSIDE the money, like the internet did creating an abundance outside the hard drives and servers it shoehorned libraries, entertainment, universities, and the whole of know human knowledge into.\n\nIt's just a thought experiment more than any accurate model.

But in a deflationary economic order (where bitcoin network is base layer) you should diversify less. The reason for this in theory is because bitcoin should produce an abundance of goods and services OUTSIDE the money, like the internet did creating an abundance outside the hard drives and servers it shoehorned libraries, entertainment, universities, and the whole of know human knowledge into.\n\nIt's just a thought experiment more than any accurate model.
