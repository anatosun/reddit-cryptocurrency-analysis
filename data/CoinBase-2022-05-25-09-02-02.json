This friend isn\u2019t actually very capable regarding crypto movements, he tried to send his ETH from his normal Coinbase account to his Coinbase Pro account. Problem is: when filling the recipient address, he pasted Coinbase #4 ETH pool wallet. Any chance of him getting the amount back through customer support? Thanks boys",
