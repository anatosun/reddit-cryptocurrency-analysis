Assuming Bitcoin is competing with gold as a **S**tore-**O**f-**V**alue, then a full node could (or should) cost that much (for the **cheapest** possible machine, with **no warranty**). Without a disposable sum of $8k, you'll just have to trust someone else's node (or rent one).\n\nThe more expensive the nodes are, the better **quality** the Bitcoin network should be. So $8k seems reasonable.\n\nIf somehow XRF machines got mass produced under a gold standard, and the price came way down, then maybe there'd be an issue. But due to intentional & speculative txn spam (fee pumping with leverage & loans, etc), it could be argued that Bitcoin nodes should be even more expensive. Full **life-time** costs for running the machine 24/7 could also be estimated.\n\n**Edit**: There are much cheaper compromise options to test gold, but the gold bugs do insist on like a $20k XRF ($8k is a cheap Chinese import). A compromise is something like being able to check the sum of all Bitcoin is under 21M, or a pruned node, etc. With an XRF some more expensive machines check the gold bar or coin inside the official sealed packaging, super accurately.\n\nEdit 2: The $8k-$9k figure is for the **EDS3900**, which can't necessarily detect tungsten (W), which is within 0.3% of a gold ounce's volume, and can be coated with gold (and alloyed with a small amount of a heavier metal to get the density exactly right). It also weighs 33kg, with portable machines being way more expensive (hand held x-ray guns are still expensive). Bitcoin only has to match gold in terms of the decentralization of its dealers, who must be sure of their coins.",
