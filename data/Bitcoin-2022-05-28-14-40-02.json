The \"Sun\" was the path of the most resistance. The Gas giants were the path of least resistance. \n\nThe mass distribution appears to follow same thought process if you look at Jupiter as the largest most outer blast area, and pluto being the tip.\"\n\nTo expand on this it makes sense as to why everything is in a simular plane if the fusion occurs with the force comming from the z axus with the least path of resistance being the x axis. This is the path of least resistance because of gravity pulling from other stellar bodies. \n\nThis appears to be replicated on a larger scale if you look at black holes. Where the energy and mass are comming from the x-axis the path of least resistance is the y or z-axis. This would also explain the gaps in spiral galaxies where there is a mass collision on the y or z-axis.",

This is called hydrostatic equilibrium. When a nuke explodes there isn't the counter balance to the energy released and so it explodes outwards in a process that is probably better described as messy rather than 'neat'!",

There is ongoing research into controlled fusion going on, but so far it always takes more energy to perform than is released. Partly because there's not really a known substitute for the containing force of gravity. Lots of experiments use high energy electromagnetic fields to keep the 'explosion' contained, but that only stops charged particles, meaning you have limited options of what reactions can be utilized, and obviously it takes a lot of electricity to generate the magnetic fields needed to contain what is effectively an H-bomb explosion!\n\nAs for weightless suns etc, it's fun to speculate on things like that, but very hard to work though how anything might work if it's not running on the physics we currently understand.\n\nThere has been fairly legitimate research done on time travel, wormholes and 'warp drives' though, so it would be foolish to completely write-off ideas just because no one has published work on them yet.\n\nIf you're interested in the more sci-fi-but-not-ridiculous side of things I really recommend the website Atomic Rockets which has a section on fusion rockets [http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/fusionfuel.php] as well as loads of other fun, related topics. Don't let the 1990's design fool you into thinking it lacks legitimacy!",

Saylor does an awesome job describing the problem with fiat and how Bitcoin is the solution.   It's not techy just explains why you need it.   \n\nLex Friedman with Breedlove is 4hrs.    That's a good one.  The Saylor one with Friedman is also great.",
