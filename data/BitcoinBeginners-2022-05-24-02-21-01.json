During this time, I used about 10 different exchanges, American, Chinese, Thai, etc.  \nI used to use classic centralized exchanges, but now with all the stories about possible blocking of wallets and that you don\u2019t really own the crypto on CEX, I started using instant-buy platforms like SimpleSwap, where you can buy crypto from a card directly to your wallet ( it is important). In this case, no one will block your transaction, will not limit your actions, and in general this is the safest way to invest in crypto that I have found.  \nTherefore, now for me in the first place is a platform like SimpleSwap.",
