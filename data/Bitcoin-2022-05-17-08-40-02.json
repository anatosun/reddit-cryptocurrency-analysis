            "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nSome days ago I tried to set up my BTC node and a BTC wallet using Bitcoin Core. After syncing, I created a wallet (I didn't know that I was creating a descriptor wallet) and generated a receiving address and sent a small transaction. As it worked, I created another receiving address and did a bigger transaction (it worked too). However, my current balance is 0. I used a btc explorer and the funds still are in the receiving address. I though that It could be because I was using the prune blockchain function. I re-indexed all the blockchain but still showing balance 0. The wallet is encrypted (there is a padlock in the lower right side corner), but it's not asking me any password to open the wallet.\n\n Don't know what more could I try, so please, let me know if I'm doing something wrong.\n\nThanks in advance.",
