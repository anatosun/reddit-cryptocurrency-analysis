To me it is not obvious why Bitcoin would be a better medium of exchange or store of value than \"the most popular privacy coin\". It seems to me that they are both capable of doing transactions, they are both \"Proof of Work\" networks, they have both not been hacked. However, \"the most popular privacy coin\" has the added benefit of privacy of the transactions.\n\nSo what am I missing? And why does Bitcoin not offer the same ability of private transactions?",

Most exchanges can exist only because there are no securities regulations they have to adhere to. And because there's a robust shitcoin market. Bitcoin itself is not profitable enough for many exchanges, the ones that don't make it their sole or only focus.",
