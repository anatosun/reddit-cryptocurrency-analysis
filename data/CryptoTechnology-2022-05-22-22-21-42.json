            "selftext": "A lot of people, especially the newer crypto audience, are under the notion that crypto as a whole is anonymous and is that you can technically do whatever you want using crypto.\n\nI blame this on how Bitcoin was very popular back in the day with dr#g dealers and how it was basically the main currency used on Silk Road.\n\nBut the reality is, crypto is a VERY transparent market. In fact it\u2019s even more transparent than banking considering that a lot of bank have bank secrecy like in Switzerland.\n\nCrypto is in fact, pseudonymous. Meaning that every single transaction you make can be traced back to your wallet, however no one can technically know who that wallet is for unless you accidentally make it identifiable or unless you use a platform with KYC.\n\nCrypto was created to enable fully transparent transactions yet protect the identity of users. And with Zero-knowledge technology seemingly taking over now, this couldn\u2019t be closer than the truth.  \nZksync and Loopring have been focusing a lot of zero-knowledge and even new L1s like Concordium are focusing a lot on their users\u2019 privacy through integration zk proofs directly onto their chain.  \nHbar has been focusing a lot of protecting their users identity as well\n\nBlockchain technology can\u2019t be a thing if addresses are anonymous cause then consensus can\u2019t be achieved. You have to always keep track of all transactions or else there\u2019s no use for crypto.",

The zodiac killer is \"anonymous\", but there's a short list of potential people (although it could be argued pseudonymous since they gave their name in code).\n\nOn a more positive note the Federalist Papers were published \"anonymously\" but the authors are now known to be Hamilton, Madison, and Jay, in spite of an earlier effort to make them pseudonymous.\n\nIt's not until you get to things so old that the records have been lost to time that anonymity exists. So the first farmer is anonymous, but only because there is no way of tracking anything about them.\n\nTrue anonymity is really hard and may be impossible.",

The latter could be something like making the transaction details unable to be audited   \n\nEither way you need to change all the wallet IDs each transaction so you can't track the balances to reverse engineer the transactions\n\nI would interpret true, mathematical anonymity mean no actor, no matter how godlike, would be able to collect data on any wallet they don't have the key to, meaning no one should be able to gain any additional info they didn't get directly.  No two pieces of information should be able to be attributed to one another, which means auditing of the system to ensure no one is cheating becomes impossible aside from trusting it's mathematically guaranteed.\n\nI don't think true anonymity is possible in practice, that requires that no action any actor takes could compromise them, which calls for spherical cows in the real world.  \n\nWhat we do have is obsification and encryption to make it as impractical as possible.  Like TOR, tor is obsification to the point we call it anonymity.  But tor is a great example, it can be (and presumably is) compromised by an actor gaining control over a certain percentage of the supernodes, which allows an actor to break into the routing process and unmask some users.  It's impractical enough that even then it's more practical to go through a side channel, like real world detective work or compromising a site and tricking a user (or their machine) into unmasking themselves",
