            "selftext": "It's pizza time! In honor of the legendary Laszlo Hanyecz who first market value to bitcoin, I've created a simple 5-word crossword:\n\n[**bitcoin-crossword.com**](https://bitcoin-crossword.com)\n\nSolving it decrypts a message containing 0.01 BTC (one million sats) hidden inside the message that holds the keys to sweeping the reward.\n\nIf you like scrutiny, please [check the open source code](https://github.com/handsomelatino/bitcoin-crossword), the encrypted message (cypher) is freely accesible to the public.\n\nI will be releasing some clues if it remains unsolved.\n\n\\---\n\n**UPDATE #1:** Clues have been added to the crossword page on the bottom, based on the comments here. More will come! Ideas for clues are welcome. Someone has made a small anonymous [6614 sats tip to the total reward](https://mempool.space/address/bc1qe926cfhzyh438fyvn9snyrcrsfujp6ur3zcrrn), yay! :)\n\n\\---\n\n**UPDATE #2:** The crossword has been solved, in less than 20 hours after publishing. Word hints have been added, for those who still would like to have fun solving the crossword!\n\nIt took me quite some time to code and design this from scratch, so it feels bittersweet to see it gone (especially the sats part lol), but my wife cheered me up saying that it's better someone solved it fast than if no one gave a damn about it and it died in oblivion.\n\nShe gets it! More projects and rewards will come.",
