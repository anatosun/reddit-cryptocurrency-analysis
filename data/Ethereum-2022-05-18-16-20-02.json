Any idea if that would even make sense, to merge a bunch of testnets into a single multi sharded PoS testnet? I know there's not a ton of cross-shard functionality implemented at the moment but it would be a cool test.\n\nI have this weird vision of networks like xDai and Polygon some day directly connecting into the Ethereum PoS validators to enable cross-shard contract calls etc. It would be neat if existing networks could easily dock and un-dock as shards from the Ethereum Mainnet PoS validator set, thus reducing overhead for bridging etc.\n\nI've heard so many different visions for what Serenity could be that I'm sure my understanding of what they're even going for is completely flawed. I'm the kind of person that needs to see something in action to build a working mental model for it.",

After Ropsten, they want the merge on Sepolia, then on Goerli (Goerli last, because many people use and need that). The merge date for Ropsten is set to June 8th, so that would mean that all three testnets could probably have transitioned to PoS by early July.\n\nAfter that, it's monitoring the situation, then setting a date for mainnet if everything is stable. Last week they agreed on the date for Ropsten rougly 4 weeks in the future, allowing client teams to publish another release and have some time for node operators to upgrade. So, if that process is similar for mainnet, a cautiously optimistic \"August\" target seems plausible now.\n\nTake it with a grain of salt, it's still software development and unexpected delays may happen, but that is my current estimate for the timeline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo all Bitcoin fans and sh\\*tcoin haters:\n\nThe merge is a mythical event that is supposed to happen always 3 months in the future. Last August it was November, in February it was June and now it's August... like all other doomsday prophecies, it should just be ignored.  ;-)",

Each passing year looks like we are increasingly more likely to set ourselves down a road with much greater wealth disparity because too many crypto enthusiasts don\u2019t seem to understand why we left the gold standard even in spite of the unprecedented growth we have had since, and that type of ideology is influencing decisions being made like a virus of the mind.",

The Ethereum protocol's use of BLS signatures results in a lower capital requirement to be a block producer than just about any other public blockchain out there.\n\nOn the Wikipedia page for BLS digital signatures, you can see the Ethereum blockchain listed as one of the notable applications of them, but I'll do my best to explain exactly why they move the needle and what they have to do with the minimum capital required to become an Ethereum block producer.\n\nAs you probably know better than I do, the BLS signature scheme has a unique property that signatures from multiple private keys can be aggregated into a single signature without the size or verification complexity of the final aggregated signature ballooning too quickly. As you know, not all digital signature schemes are like this.\n\nEthereum currently has 382,562 active block producers (validators) in its beacon chain proof of stake system, and for the chain's security, every validator \"signs off\" or \"attests\" to every block that's produced there, multiple times every minute. (When a validator misses a block attestation, they are penalized a small amount of ETH as an \"inactivity fee\" instead of earning ETH, so every validator tries their best to sign off on every block.) What this design means is that Ethereum needs a signature scheme that can efficiently aggregate those hundreds of thousands of signatures so that they don't take up too much bandwidth being sent across the gossip network and stored on disk, and BLS fit that bill.\n\nContrast Ethereum's 382,562 block producers (validators), each with unique private keys, with Cardano's 3201 block producers (staking pool operators). The big difference is in the signature aggregation technology. I'm looking at Cardano's Ouroboros paper right now, and it appears that they use ECDSA signatures for signing blocks. If the Cardano protocol allowed 300k block producers to join it like Ethereum allows, my understanding is that every block (20 seconds) would contain nearly 200MB just of signatures, that's a sustained data rate of over 80Mbps, just in signatures! But since you're the cryptographer here, maybe you could be the one to clarify that for me!\n\nIn summary, due to an aggregation-friendly signature scheme, Ethereum PoS supports a large amount of validators signing every block. This is a property that other chains that do not use aggregation-friendly signature schemes, such as Cardano, lack.\n\nNow, we've got these two chains. Ethereum, which supports a large amount of block producers, and Cardano, which supports a relatively small amount of block producers. Imagine for the sake of argument that each network has the exact same amount of staking demand in dollar terms. That is, people want to stake $100B worth of ADA on Cardano, and people want to stake $100B worth of ETH on Ethereum. In Ethereum, that amount can be staked over 382,562 block producers, so that each block producer controls $261,000 worth of ETH. In Cardano, that amount must be staked over 3201 block producers, so each block producer controls $31 Million worth of ADA. That means that the capital requirement to join the block producer set in Cardano is over 100x higher than in Ethereum!\n\nNow, the real numbers aren't quite that clean because in practice the total value of staked ADA is different from the value of staked ETH, and the ADA staking requirement is floating compared to the ETH staking requirement which is fixed by the protocol. But hopefully this illustrates why Ethereum's use of BLS signatures leads to a higher supported block producer count, which leads to lower capital requirements to participate in the network as a block producer, which has a decentralizing effect on the network.\n\nIf you want to dive in and learn more about the Ethereum protocol from some of the smartest people I know, join us in the /r/ethfinance daily discussion thread.
