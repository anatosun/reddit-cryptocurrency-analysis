I'm a participant as much as I need to be but mostly a messenger.\n\nHow it's done is not as hard as you'd think... It's like riding a bike.\n\nAdded: or to over use the same analogy over and over pac man controls the ghosts. You are Hacking the ghosts when you learn their rule sets and realize it. That's how by juking pacman and knowing each of the rules sets you can steer the ghosts all in a line each at their own pace right as you zig zag to a corner pellet.\n\nYour opponent is the exchange bots. They run off of poker AI and play off your fud and fomo. To simulate your fud and fomo they also have fud and fomo. Play the game upside down and right side up as needed. That's what I mean by how it's like riding a bike. \n\nPlay long enough and you'll learn how to steer the cherry.\n\nAny questions just dm. In the mean time buy a doge every so often but set the limit a bit higher. It'll cost you nothing per doge. Think about the effects of crowd power. Everything is a game if you learn the rules.\n\nThe game is not your opponent. The board is neutral. Whether it's rh or wb. They're actually more transparent than say chase... There's a habit to blame the game if it happens to reveal manipulation as if the exchange is a closed system. The exchange is doing you a favor by revealing the manipulation. It has been happening all along since 2012",

That's why we're all anonymous and will never claim credit.

Some people think of Doge as a stable coin. \n\nPeople will probably never trust terra Luna ecosystem which once supported a very well respected stable coin in UST but I don\u2019t think that people should give up on stable coins and the opportunity that they represent.\n\nThe only people who are buying terra Luna are basically buying a Call option on the ecosystem somehow reviving itself over time but that\u2019s like buying an office suite in the World Trade Center on September 12th, 2001 knowing it has to be rebuilt and while it might be able to restablish its peg to a dollar so that those who were hurt from the UST stable coin crash can have their dollar losses restored but unfortunately I don\u2019t think that anybody wants to be on the Terra Luna side of losing 99% of the investment and have to hold hoping that someday that it would return from the dead.\n\nSpaceX had a few failed launches before they made it off this planet safely and I think stable-coins are a good thing for society provided we can keep them algorithmically stable and minimize collateral damage but at the end of the day it\u2019s crypto and crypto is a casino and there will be winners and there will be losers and when you buy a token or coin you\u2019ve spoke your peace but when it comes to stable coins we need stability that is at least one order of magnitude more stable to the dollar because if we had a coin that was stable within a dime or 10 cents a 50% loss in peg is only .05 cents which I\u2019m sure is easier to repair than a loss of peg that is 50% but equated to .50 cents which is 10 times more money. \n\nWe live under an illusion that money is stable in value but in reality it isn\u2019t because of inflation. It would be interesting to get real numbers on how much the dollar has lost in its theoretical peg to debt instruments in the last two years I\u2019ve seen and heard figures come in as high as 30%.\n\nUnfortunately in Terra lunas case they live in an ecosystem bound by rules that hold them accountable to the blockchain as it exists and they cannot simply dive into the backend of the software and change the numbers so that people magically have their dollars return to peg because well that\u2019s the definition of inflation.",

It's not feasible to do with a hard-capped currency like gold or Bitcoin, because you'll have too many people and not enough dough to circulate between them. What separates Doge from say the U.S. Dollar is that amount of Doge circulating is annually increased at a **flat, fixed amount of 5 billion per year,** not by a percentage.\n\nThis is important because as years go by and there's more in circulation, the actual inflation rate will decrease every year, because the amount of newly minted Doge remained the same. In fact, it'll have a lower inflation rate than the U.S. Dollar because of this, yet still grow just a bit to combat lost/broken wallets and population growth.",

Let's say everyone in the world had an equal amount of dogecoin right this second, we'd all only have a little over 16 dogecoins.  \n\nIn a stable and healthy financial system the supply should grow to keep up with demand while decreasing the rate of inflation over time, naturally.   This is the magic of doge.\n\nThis is the way.",

It\u2019s just the spot price multiplied by the total number of coins issued, that\u2019s all. So if anything, eliminating rewards would reduce the market cap, not increase it.\n\nPlus, without rewards, nobody would mine. And then there\u2019d be nothing to stop some scumbag carrying out a 51% attack and making the coin totally worthless. As in $0.000000000 with no chance of recovery.\n\nBe careful what you wish for.

We over over steered like crazy because we forgot about the human factor. When you're just playing the bots 100 percent clear seems like 100 percent clear. The reversal did happen on schedule... But then the human factor kicked in news bots clean amok and amplified the effects way beyond anything we planned for and i regret having any part in it now...\n\nWhich is why I didn't have any role in this play and made it abundantly clear I'd just be watching just in case. Just in case happened.... So all I'm trying to do is simmer things down.\n\nMy buy in seems to have been misinterpreted as a reversal and I didn't mean for that to happen to be perfectly honest. It was more of a controlled fire to make sure the fire wouldn't keep spreading.\n\nIf the community wants something they really just have to ask. If the community is on board then the majority will gain. We've always done our demos publicly and transparently for that reason.\n\nMy erm... Shadow isn't quite so public and doesn't follow my rules. Elon buying Twitter both made people angry and afraid. So there's a lot of emotion guiding this thing... And I'm trying to be as cool headed as possible and keeping the olive branch out there.\n\nI can speak to the person I tranfered my entire tool kit to.\n\nDoge = Elon's Ego was the rallying cry. That's why I posted it a number of times... Elon needed to be brought down a few pegs. If I see a change in the man I'll be happy to be his friend. Lol probably not... The guy literally went to an eppstein party. \n\nHim using kids from MIT to do things like try to invent his Hyperloot is not comely for someone in his generation and position. It should be the other way around. At least Elizabeth holmes was young... And had an idea that could have worked but the same thing happened. She lied. She could have had all the brightest minds break down her goal one test at a time optimizing each and each would be a product better than what is and would be part of the road map to Edison...\n\nBut she was used as a pawn in a ponzi scheme as well.\n\nElon is running the biggest ponzi scheme on the globe.",

I would think in a bear market, coins that pay dividends would be more popular. They were last December during the last crash. What\u2019s different now? And how will this affect DOGE going to proof-of-stake, as the foundation claimed last December?",

You need to make sure you're putting those funds to another asset that you're confident will outperform what you're selling in the first place. \n\nBasically would you trade your $$ in Meta stock for Doge?",

It would have to go back above my initial investment to actually make me money and that might take years at this point.\n\nHowever, if I trade my $$ in Meta stock for Doge, I can get the $600 write-off and then any $$ I make on Doge (or any other stock/crypto I invest in) is profit. The way I see it, if I keep my Meta and I gain $300 (-$600 to -$300) I'm still down $300, but essentially 0 with the write-off. If I sell my meta though and the stuff I buy with the money gains $300, I'm up $300 with a $600 write-off that offsets my loss. $0 vs $300. Is this right or am I understanding this wrong?",

What bothers me is the rudeness of others when you posed the question.  Some people are just mean and I don't understand why they are part of a community that chooses to Do Only Good Everyday.  \n\nYou should not be ostracized for asking something of the community and have people answer it rudely.\n\nJust hodl or buy the dip shibe.

Then later even lower for the last third. It\u2019s a bad idea to buy all at once in crypto especially. Right now is danger zone for every single crypto out there except maybe BTC and Ethereum. Yes even they are down but being the alphas it\u2019s safer to assume they will recover at the end of this collapse. Every other coin is a crap shoot currently",

Like these I just ran off on walletgenerator.net\u2026\n\n^1,\"DBfmvvgoX5VgEHPBEfrwS1bPP1ujn2nfP1\",\"6JrvJBpGzpnztLJsgNkjA3Ku52LyRbZPBrxngd67jNdQd59x5EL\"\n^2,\"DL7U9kR4tiUGKQZPr8mxy1s3s6xRGn2UXJ\",\"6JaS5kMnJgppZcawpcNJWnk6ZQk3GYdQ9UAopWhWXXXdgZfeYPe\"\n^3,\"DDwxp5dJ19YuVdwYe3xAkaZpFY8DoGcXSu\",\"6JvY2ZccFAAUqzRNcRTZPAtujXn5w63rWNVAYbZ2P2zgCo3Gz3j\"\n\nIf you generate a batch of wallets and stick them in a text file, that\u2019s all you need. As long as you and only you have the private key, any coins sent to that wallet are absolutely safe. But lose that key and there is no chance of recovery. Let someone else get hold of it, like I just did above, and they can steal your coins.\n\nTherefore, the text file must be stored offline securely. On multiple removable media stored in separate, safe places. You don\u2019t want Russian soldiers confiscating your only copy, as has happened. You don\u2019t want the house to burn down or flood and wipe out all your copies.\n\nYou also need a way to send coins. That involves generating a transaction and signing it with the key to prove ownership. You can do that with coinb.in. Which you can play with, using any wallet at all, even one of the top 100, to learn how it works. But for your actual wallets, download a copy and run it locally offline. Never expose your keys to the internet.\n\nNow, as to the two pieces of software you chose, and the wallets they contain. This is where it gets tricky.\n\nClients don\u2019t as a matter of course tell you your keys. You ***SHOULD*** be able to extract them, but whether or not you can and how you do it depends. If you do not get your keys, and store them safely as I outlined above, then if the client dies, your coins are permanently lost.\n\nThis has happened to thousands of people. And ALL clients have been responsible for losses in more ways than you can count.\n\nSo, find out which clients you\u2019re using and how to get your keys out, in a form you can actually read with your own eyes. Like the three wallets above. Get your keys out. Store them in a text file. Throw the clients away.\n\nWhy that last bit? Mainly because clients have one particularly nasty habit. They generate big batches of wallets, and then every time you spend coins, they send any change to a new wallet, AND THEY DON\u2019T TELL YOU! This means you have no idea that your million Doge are no longer in the wallet you think they\u2019re in, and so if you don\u2019t back things up properly, you lose them because you didn\u2019t get a copy of the key. This has happened to many people here as well, and the losses amount to many millions of coins.",
