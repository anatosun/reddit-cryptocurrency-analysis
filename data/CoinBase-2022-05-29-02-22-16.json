            "selftext": "I have been trying to send GST and GMT out of coinbase for the past 3 days. If I try on my laptop it says sent but doesn't go through and doesn't appear on my transaction list. It outputs 3 errors in the terminal if I look at it through the inspect tool. If I try on my phone it says sent but when I go to the transaction it says \"we're having connection issues\" and never goes through. I also tried on coinbase pro 7 times and each time it canceled my withdrawal because \"Blockchain transaction has been compensated\". But from my experience, it emails me way too fast to have actually tried to send a transaction before saying it failed. List of things I have tried: log out and log back in, restart my phone, contact support, update the app, try chrome and safari, and basically any other solution I found in a Reddit comment section. Any help is appreciated :D",

I only ha e problems with coinbase pro, desktop and app, half the time it takes 3 minutes to even load. They need to scrap pro and rebuild it. No other exchange gives me problems. Good luck and your not alone",
