The argument being made is that because it lost 54% of its value, it\u2019s not a good store of value. Whether it\u2019s 6 months of 6 years, it didn\u2019t do a good job of storing value if it loses 54% of its value.\n\nAnd if you say that the time does matter, then look at the best preforming asset of the last 10 years. It\u2019s not gold, housing, or any stock.",
