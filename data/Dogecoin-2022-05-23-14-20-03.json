I bet when he created Doge he obviously wanted to make fun of all crytpo. He NEVER expected Dogecoin to be viral and become the most popular crypto with a beautiful community surrounding it. Jackson talks about problems and complains all the time but really is dealing with the realization that he missed on the train to do something special with his own creation. \n\nJackson is bitter and jealous of Elon because he wanted to make a point and mock the crypto world but instead it backfired on him really bad. He is now devoured with shame and jalelousy for not believing in its own baby! Yep, Jackson is like a parent who abandoned his child and the child grew up to become the new MJ, now he is trying to justify what he did and mentally cope with it.\n\nSad!",

I just find what you said controversial.\n\n>People like you are why him and billy left in the first place.\n\nBecause technically Jackson is one back on YouTube slandering crypto and Elon Musk maybe you should tell Jackson to move on and leave us alone as he is the one making public apparition and attacking and vilifying individuals \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nFYI if you listen to him speak, he said he made Doge as joke to make fun of others in the crypto world, then he abandoned it(Not a nice way to behave don't you think) Maybe karma bit him in the butt on that one.",

Calling them names and other insulting things.\nYou said to me ' leave him alone' \nWell it sounds freaking hypocritical since Jackson is the one attacking others. \n\nThere is a name for people like you that jumped into chats/convo without knowing what the subject of discussion is to just to get a little attention. That name is 'Child's!",
