Your will that has a tamper proof seal can reveal the location of your passphrase and the bank they can uncover your safety deposit box upon death . Legally they would not have access to the safety deposit box until after your death \n\nThis way if your safety deposit box gets stolen or seized it would just reveal the decoy wallet with a small balance and not your real wallet \n\nIf someone prematurely opens your will you would see evidence of this and that would reveal the passphrase alone which is not enough because they would not have access to your hidden hardware wallet or backup seed words in the safety deposit box\n\nMore sophisticated solutions would be using a multisig instead",

I\u2019d like to add that making sure that the people that the btc gets passed to fully understand bitcoin, wallets, private and public keys, seed phrases etc. is highly important too. Make sure they\u2019re comfortable with the transaction process, verifying keys and the importance of keeping your keys secure. We are all radically responsible for our own bitcoin and it must be protected.",

Given how secure phrases are and if you don't have any other ones accessible, it is paramount that the passing down isn't botched. So in some ways it's just as important you ensure nothing happens to your seed phrase in storage just like you protect your seed phrase from being stolen. If anything is missing in the transfer, no one can access your key. This is why I often stress on the importance of not losing seed phrases, whereas most users including yourself seem to be stressing protection against malware. I find the former to be a more common form of lost access which users don't think about enough.\n\n>I am wondering what \"harmed\" constitutes here as its a very general list of concerns grouped. In most cases a metal backup within these \"harmed\" safety deposit boxes would be perfectly fine. Thus the more important question is how often are boxes stolen or lost .\n\nIt's unclear, but in the article it talks about banks doing some basic operations of moving stuff around. Not because they want to lose your stuff, but think about it. Over time bank buildings, vaults, etc need to be maintained, updated. So say they're renovating the safe deposit section--they probably work room by room row by row, so they may temporarily move your stuff out to renovate a room, move it back in. Now all of that can be done securely, but it doesn't mean there aren't mistakes. Also branches move too--sometimes they may decide to consolidate branches (as more people do things online these days), or new larger ones are built and they decide to move vaults. My point is human error exists and this is a threat to your seed phrase integrity.\n\n>Another question that comes to mind is how common are these concerns in well established and trusted banks with better security vs small private businesses ?\n\nGood question, but the stories in NYT article involve at least 3 of the 4 big banks.\n\n>Keep in mind that I never suggested safety deposit boxes are the best solution just one of the simplest solutions. I would be curious to hear your solution to these concerns\n\nFair enough. It is an option for a solution and I have to admit I haven't researched this enough. From a high level standpoint, you know I've been posting on here for a while but I'm a big fan of digital backups. I know there is risk involved, but nothing is risk free. If done properly, you can probably mitigate a lot of risk of malware (e.g. airgapped computers, etc.). It's far easier to have duplicate copies, stored in multiple digital vaults that can be unlocked with a passphrase the same way you are proposing (via will). Digital account access can be granted upon presentation of a death certificate (pretty typical these days for big data companies).\n\nIt's far from perfect, but I think this is something probably worth consulting an estate lawyer over.",

The general rule of thumb for most people is to never store their seed words or passphrase digitally. \n\nPersonally, my suggestion of using a safety deposit box is not my own solution as I use carefully setup and tested multisig which is not easy to properly setup.\n\nThe biggest concern with multisig is not merely the complexity but dataloss from the xpubs/ypubs/zpubs that need to be backed up for recovery and aren't mnemonic(which exists in part to help prevent data loss). Any typos of the master public keys or degradation in what you have stamped/written or bitrot down can lead to loss of funds. Of course if all 3 sigs in a 2 of 3 have all 3 xpubs/ypubs/zpubs you can suffer partial data loss in 1 of the 3 but it is a concern . Typically since writing out such a long string of \"random\" characters is so cumbersome people also digitally copy the master public keys and store them digitally which also means a potential privacy concern as well.\n\nWhat would be better is a mnemonic standard for the master public keys to solve some of these concerns that is unique enough not to be confused with BIP39\n\nRight now there are not any great solutions but ones that have tradeoffs. **Your concerns with safety deposit boxes are completely valid.** I simply wish we had better data on those but I suppose this is wishful thinking. Perhaps in the future with covenants/vaults being used this would create a safer standard",

I'm not advocating for private deposit box either. The point is there's extremely little regulation here. This is like banks pre-FDIC or maybe even earlier.\n\n>This is very risky due to bitrot concerns and proper encryption and storage in clean environments. The general rule of thumb for most people is to never store their seed words or passphrase digitally. \n\nI don't advocate storing it on a personal hard drive. If HDD, then 3-2-1 rules need to apply, but I do think perhaps cloud solutions are useful provided you encrypt the files ahead of time. There are probably also other good habits such as users checking in on their solutions--for instance if a cloud backup provider you used is no longer in business, the strategy will fail, so it's important to double check these things. Big data providers like LastPass, Google, DropBox, etc may be good solutions if you want longevity.\n\nSome of my assumptions are that many of us chatting here are young, so this is more geared for the relatively young. If you're 96 years old and concerned with passing down Bitcoin, you might not even be in a physical or mental state good enough to manage backup/storage/protection schemes.\n\nHowever for those of us concerned that relatively young and healthy people can potentially suddenly die leaving millions locked away and unretrievable for their spouses, I do think a cloud backup may make sense. The addage that peopel should not enter their seed phrases digitally is solely focused on the risk of malware. However, as I said, there are ways to mitigate this with airgapped devices. I also think there's a huge difference between a one time backup versus accessing and copy pasting or typing your seed phrase on a daily basis. The latter is far more dangerous.",

Any typos of the master public keys or degradation in what you have stamped/written or bitrot down can lead to loss of funds. Of course if all 3 sigs in a 2 of 3 have all 3  xpubs/ypubs/zpubs you can suffer partial data loss in 1 of the 3 but it is a concern . Typically since writing out such a long string of \"random\" characters is so cumbersome people also digitally copy the master public keys and store them digitally which also means a potential privacy concern as well. \n\nWhat would be better is a mnemonic standard for the master public keys to solve some of these concerns that is unique enough not to be confused with BIP39",
