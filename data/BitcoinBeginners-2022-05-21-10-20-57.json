Your will that has a tamper proof seal can reveal the location of your passphrase and the bank they can uncover your safety deposit box upon death . Legally they would not have access to the safety deposit box until after your death \n\nThis way if your safety deposit box gets stolen or seized it would just reveal the decoy wallet with a small balance and not your real wallet \n\nIf someone prematurely opens your will you would see evidence of this and that would reveal the passphrase alone which is not enough because they would not have access to your hidden hardware wallet or backup seed words in the safety deposit box\n\nMore sophisticated solutions would be using a multisig instead",

I\u2019d like to add that making sure that the people that the btc gets passed to fully understand bitcoin, wallets, private and public keys, seed phrases etc. is highly important too. Make sure they\u2019re comfortable with the transaction process, verifying keys and the importance of keeping your keys secure. We are all radically responsible for our own bitcoin and it must be protected.",
