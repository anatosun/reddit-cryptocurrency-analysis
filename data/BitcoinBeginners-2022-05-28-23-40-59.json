If one person can buy so much, they can artificially change its value.\"\n\nSo I answered them:\n\n\"While you are correct that the price of Bitcoin can be manipulated, unfortunately that is something that exists in an open market. Billion dollar hedge-funds or asset managers indeed take advantage of THIS. They can move markets and cause people with weak hands to panic and sell thereby driving the price down even further etc. Or the other way round and cause people to FOMO into it.\n\nHowever, to answer your question of how can bitcoin not be controlled; if one understands Bitcoin, then one understands that the Bitcoin network achieves digital  scarcity for its BTC payment system. You cannot duplicate or double-spend your BTC.\n\nThe reason this is important is because as Bitcoin continues to grow (for 13 years already) and gain worldwide adoption, people don't just hold it on exchanges and they start withdrawing it from there. They use it on their own wallet. That means the exchanges actually need to have the Bitcoin. Otherwise, nobody would trust them.\n\nWhy is this important? Because as people withdraw, the exchanges have to actually go and buy more Bitcoins on the open market. That drives the price up (hence digital scarcity).\n\nThis is the main reason Bitcoin has been able to grow in price consistently ever since its inception.\n\nThis is so important to understand because the US government has been manipulating the price of Gold via rehypothecation.\n\nThe US sells paper-gold on the open markets. This paper gold is an IOU. It's not real gold. So when gold becomes valuable due to high demand (I. E. When the US dollar weakens and inflation is high), the US sells paper-gold on the open market to drive its price down and keep it down. The US does not want the world to see Gold as a store of value over the US dollar.\n\nSo the US plays God and controls the supply and demand of a supposedly 'free' market to maintain its dollar status of the world reserve currency.\n\nThe US cannot do this to Bitcoin. Although exchanges do engage in this fractional reserve system where they don't hold as much Bitcoin as people actually have on their exchange, they are limited as to how much they can do this. They do not want to risk a scenario where they are short Bitcoins and they experience a 'bank run'. Just image, Binance or Coinbase not letting their customers withdraw Bitcoins. They are so big and rich and they do not want to risk this.\n\nI hope this gives you some clarity as to how much Bitcoin can be controlled.\n\nPlease feel free to follow up with more questions.\"",

It's no different in the stock market, or with gold, or anything else. Strong demand (people buy) = price go up",

Then there\u2019s \u2018controlled\u2019 which means can change the rules, like printing more bitcoin and giving it to their banker friends. The second is far and away the most impactful and that\u2019s what Bitcoin is resistant to. No corporation, government, or central bank can change the code, no matter how much bitcoin they own. They have to play by the same rules that you and I do.",
