For example, psychosis symptoms typically appear in the victim's mid-20s.  \n\nThe people who hang out in buttcoin, and pathetic trolls who come here...  They're mentally ill.  Or, they've had one or more serious head injuries; there is brain damage inside which can only be observed with the proper kind of brain scan.  Others have damaged their minds by abusing drugs, alcohol, etc.  Some people have two or three of those problems.  \n\nLook, normal people with healthy minds don't go around trolling people, don't go around making bold statements about things they have no understanding of, etc.  But the people who hang out in buttcoin do engage in such activities.  Why?  Because they're fucked up.  Their brains aren't functioning properly.  \n\nNobody can just talk sense into them.  It doesn't work that way.  Unless, by some stroke of luck, a person like that realizes that they have a serious problem, and seeks proper treatment, they're not going to just snap out of it.  \n\nThey're not interested in facts, unless they can somehow attack you with them.  They're not interested in truth, unless they decide to accuse you of lying.  \n\nFurthermore, they're broke.  They can't buy Bitcoin.  \n\nThey'd be homeless \"bums\" on the street, except they have an \"enabler\".  Typically, their mom lets them live at home in their 40s and 50s.  They can't get and keep a job.  They hang out, cowardly trying to upset/hurt strangers on the Internet all day, every day.  \n\nYou can't help them.  I'm sure you have better uses for your time than going there to get trolled by them.",

It\u2019s about trading a flawed asset (fiat) for a sound asset (Satoshi\u2019s). The sound money over time tends to accrue purchasing power but you won\u2019t ever catch me selling it to make fiat.

My accountant filed an extension for my taxes because, let\u2019s just leave it as there\u2019s a lot to go through haha, but one of our disagreements is over crypto. Does anyone know the correct way to report gains/losses in the US? Also when it comes to being gifted Bitcoin? My accountant and I are having a disagreement because I don\u2019t think if someone gifts me $25 of Bitcoin that I should report it as income, if it was for coffee or what not from a friend or whoever. But he\u2019s telling me we need to report that as income. Additionally I\u2019m a little confused about \u201chold times,\u201d when it comes to crypto. For example I had 1 btc on Kraken purchased back in 2017 that I transferred over to Coinbase {I just feel like my assets are safer there} in December. Now if I were to sell my Bitcoin{which I\u2019m not} how would that work since the Bitcoin is still the same Bitcoin, just on a different exchange? I invested in crypto years ago because I loved the idea of decentralization and I also happen to be a libertarian. But, I\u2019m just a little lost on how to approach my next conversation with my accountant. Does anyone have any good advice or any guidance? Thanks in advance! \ud83d\ude0d",

If it was a reward (e.g. a Coinbase reward) that is income, but if its just a friend sending you $25 in BTC for your birthday or whatever, I would not consider it income.\n\nSending it from one wallet to another or one exchange to another should not be seen as a taxable event.  Your basis, and the time of holding for determining short term v. long term capital gains, should be when you first purchased the coin for fiat or by converting a separate coin/token into BTC.  Similar to moving your stocks from ETrade to Ameritrade is not taxable, moving from Kraken to Coinbase should not be seen as a taxable event.",
