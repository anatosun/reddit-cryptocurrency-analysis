If you don\u2019t plan on moving your bitcoin off of wealthsimple/exchanges, I suggest you buy the BTC spot ETF and put it in your TFSA (assuming you have space for it). You\u2019ll benefit from the price action of BTC all while not having any capital gains taxes when you eventually sell down the line! That being said, holding the real BTC in cold storage is always better for safety purposes.",
