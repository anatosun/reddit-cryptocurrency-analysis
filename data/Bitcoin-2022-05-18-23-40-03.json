A long mega cycle was on the table (unlikely) or a crypto winter until appr. a year after the next halving. With world politics and high inflation the second scenario was more likely. We personally expected crypto to move in cycles and a crash after the peak. We planned last year to accumulate through the winter in order to be financially free after the next bullrun. Since Jan 22 we increased our portfolio by 75% and still buying. I'm confident that the next bullrun with a 10x-15x overall will take us to f u money.",

I will do this on the way up, and on the way down. I might reevaluate if crypto outperforms that great that despite this scheme, I would sit on more than 80% crypto in my portfolio.
