            "selftext": "I was listening to Harari on the Sam Harris podcast (ep 276, March 22, 2022, about 52min in, for anyone interested) and am having trouble reconciling what he said on the podcast to my interpretation of his thoughts on money, in his \u2018Sapiens\u2019 book. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve read it, but regarding money, he goes through some of the history, how it\u2019s not much more than a religion (requiring inter subjective belief), and how we moved from grains, to gold, to fiat etc. I would have thought bitcoin would be the natural extension of that list, as Harari seems to believe value is subjective, but his podcast interview did not support it. \n\nIn the podcast, he states that he\u2019s not sure that blockchain technology eliminates trust, as we would still need human institutions to set up, interpret, and monitor. I might chalk this up to his lack of understanding of bitcoin\u2019s decentralization and its differentiation from other cryptos. Harari goes on and says that the financial history of the world is about moving from \u2018currencies of distrust\u2019 to \u2018currencies of trust\u2019. The example he brings up is ancient Mesopotamia and how trading grain was the original currency. We did not need to \u2018trust\u2019 in the grain\u2019s value, as we can simply eat it and knows its inherent value. \n\nHarari says blockchain technology is an attempt of going back to once again not trusting people, but simply to trust technology instead. He says as a historian, he\u2019s skeptical of this attempt to take humans out of the loop. \n\nI can see his points being more applicable to the non-bitcoin cryptos, which have founders. I should mention, he also makes the comparison to the Talmud, which is supposed to be the definitive text for biblical interpretations for Jews, and how Rabbis are still required to interpret the interpretation (kind of like alt coins).  \n\nI\u2019ve read his books and hold him as a great thinker. In Homo Deus he tries to give some insights into the future\u2019s technologies. But not sure how he\u2019s missing the mark with bitcoin. \n\nThoughts?",

This is how modern civilization operates, under the threat of violence. Not because we trust them. Because we are afraid of them.\n\nInstead of admitting that fear is the main motivating factor behind out actions, as slaves would admit, we take the coward's way out, rationalize our fear by having this pretend democracy, once in a few years we choose our slave masters. This is the definition of illusion of control. True slavery is honest, we are dishonest slaves, engaged in self-deception. \n\nIf we hate freedom so much, if we hate personal responsibility, if we desire central planners to tell us what to to do, let\u2019s cut the bullshit and collectively admit it and embrace absolute global dictatorship, absolute dictatorship, as in  God made flesh who decides what is right and what is wrong, and there is no one on the planet to undermine their authority. And by the way that the best shot we got to solve man-made climate change and save humanity, so there is that. \n\nGod decides there will be no consumption of animal products anymore, bans dirty energy sources and moves towards clean renewable energy globally. Essentially solves the problem of climate change and secures our future. The price? Stop pretending that we are free, accept honest slavery.  HAHAHA",
