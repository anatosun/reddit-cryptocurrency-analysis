Basically I want to be able to protect myself from big losses by putting in a stop limit that would trigger if the price went down by a specified amount,  but I also want to be able to lock in gains by putting in a limit if instead the price goes up by a specified amount. And if the price stays between those two points just continue to hold. \n\nDoes anybody know if something like this is possible, and if so how to set it up on coinbase pro?",

Wondering now if any other platform allows for what I'm trying to do, or if it might be possible to use some python code with the coinbase pro API to replicate what I'm looking for (maybe cancel the down order and place the up order when the price is closer to my upper limit,  and vice versa when the price is closer to my down limit,  so there's only ever one order in okay at a time but it still accomplishes what I'm hoping for).",
