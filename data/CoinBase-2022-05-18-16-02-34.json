Selling when I was down for fear of going down further is easily one of the biggest financial mistakes I've ever made.  Granted I was fairly new to investing at the time, and thought it was the smart (safe) thing to do.  Felt like a genius at first because the market went down probably another 15% after I sold, but then I never bought back in at the lows before it ripped up.  Would have been in massive profit.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost recently, I sold a good chunk of my holdings at the beginning of January because let's face it, the writing was on the wall we had seen the top.  Bought back in in late Feb, then sold again in the late March pump.  Since then I've just been stacking BTC and ADA along with a couple other L2's and whatnot.  Bought Ape at 7 bucks when it launched, sold that at 22, then bought back in at 6 last week.  I've had a fairly successful 2022 so far (even with this recent dump), and I don't think I would have been nearly as successful had it not been for the harsh lesson learned back in 2017.",

Now somehow after my limit changing back to $25000 it\u2019s lowered  to $7500. I went to request another increase and it say I have to wait 24 days. This is beyond ridiculous, I want to know why this keeps happening??",
