That means buying shares of GME is literally free money because the hedge funds have to buy all of the shares to cover there shorts. We own the float. We set the price. When the hedge funds buy the shares to cover there shorts the mother of all short squeezes will happen and GME will be worth millions of dollars per share. The squeeze will last for months or even years. I wont let the hedge funds buy my shares for less than $10 million each. Just read the DD on r/Superstonk and then buy GME and DRS your shares.

USD is explicitly unbacked. A centralized ledger relies completely on kinetic security and trust of the administrators.\n\nBacking is added to a paper or centralized digital ledger to impute trust that administrators will not abuse the infinite supply inherent in these ledgers. The idea is if they do there is a redemption mechanism to call the supply bluff (ie everyone tries to withdraw their USD gold backing at once). \n\nThe Nixon Shock illustrates why this isn't a reliable system unless the scarcity is inherent to the ledger itself. The Ruble is now \"gold backed\" but that is meaningless unless you trust Putin to honor the redemption mechanism. \n\nThe breakthrough of Bitcoin is a ledger that does not require an external mechanism to maintain supply. It's the first digital ledger with the scarcity mechanism built in. The impossibility of a Nixon shock is not a bug, it is *the* feature.",

And as we see these behaviors continue with respect to the management of the dollar, the confidence continues to drop in it and this contributes to the decline of purchasing power (purchasing power of the dollar has in fact, been in decline for a great many years, though remarkably and notably we have seen inflation rise and buying / purchasing power drop lately more significantly).\n\nBitcoin does provide an option (a buffer) against this, but only if one is thinking rationally and making careful long term steps.  Reasonable approaches involve [DCA](https://dcabtc.com) into a hardware wallet or a Wyoming licensed institution.  Those who panic (and make frequent trades in and out of bitcoin) are likely not going to fare well in the long term.  Periodic acquisition (not \"day trading for gains\") is a safe pathway through catastrophic conditions.  It is also worth noting that simple acquisition doesn't have tax consequences in the U.S. whether you are acquiring it to store directly on a hardware wallet or putting dollars into an crypto IRA (such as iTrustCapital where you'd then buy bitcoin).  \n\nEDIT, NOTE:  In this discussion linked below, I explain why we are on a glide path to recession in 2022 and what will constitute a full economic hard crash in 2023. There is still time to prepare for this, and many people with sufficient preparation can find a way to ride it out although the shocks are already being felt.  It will not be easy, though.\n\nSee:\n\n[https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/udx62t/mfw\\_the\\_us\\_gov\\_prints\\_another\\_trillion/i6kej31/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/udx62t/mfw_the_us_gov_prints_another_trillion/i6kej31/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)",
