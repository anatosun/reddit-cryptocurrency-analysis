Someone posted a link of KuCoin buying spot a bunch to their hot wallet, because they probably couldn't broker a big OTC deal. Binance owns like 20mill+ iirc. \n\nBinance also probably doesn't want to sell any to CB. It's their insurance policy if, hypothetically, Nano were to be the dominant PoW cash coin imo.\n\nBut yea, adding it would still be a huge plus for crypto as a whole. It also let's people onramp holdings and trade faster (which means more money for exchanges), since Nano is so fast and $0 in transaction fees. So there should be a mutual interest for Coinbase to add it at some point.\n\nFor now, the old guard seems to want to ignore it.... (sounds familiar...)",

No reply to my complaint and when I tried reaching out over the phone to follow up due to the radio silence, they just open a new case through the scripted process their customer support phone team has.\n\nI guess the next step needs to start and perhaps my attorney will have better luck to get a reply.",
