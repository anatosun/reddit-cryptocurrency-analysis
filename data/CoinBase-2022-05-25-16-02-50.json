While I\u2019m extremely relieved that it went through, I\u2019m quite concerned with the future. \nWhat if I want to sell another crypto asset when it makes a crazy pump? Coinbase pro \u201ccoincidently\u201d will go down again because of \u201ctechnical issues\u201d causing me to miss out on 10\u2019s of thousands of dollars??!\nI know this place probably isn\u2019t the right place to ask but anyone know a better platform than Coinbase so this doesn\u2019t happen in the future?\nI really want to move everything out of here and ASAP!!",
