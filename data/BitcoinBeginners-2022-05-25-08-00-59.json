See this calculator for the vbyte size of a transaction  \nhttps://bitcoinops.org/en/tools/calc-size/  \n\nIf you wanted to send the smallest possible transaction, the transaction will be SegWit, and it will have one input and one output. Its vbyte size will be 110 vbytes. Your fee will be 110 Satoshis (at least)  \n\nThe fee in a Bitcoin transaction is not part of the transaction. It is calculated by subtracting the output amounts from the input amounts  \n\nTo send 1 Satoshi, your input would need to be a coin with a value of 111 Satoshis  \n\n###Dust Limit  \n\nNode policy rules will reject a transaction with an output amount less than the dust limit, which is 294 Satoshis  \nhttps://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/10986/what-is-meant-by-bitcoin-dust/  \n\nTo send 294 Satoshis with a fee of 110 Satoshis, your transaction input needs to spend a coin with a value of 404 Satoshis",
