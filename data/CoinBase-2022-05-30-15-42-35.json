I\u2019ve made some purchases and some have given me the rewards while others haven\u2019t. I look at the history and it\u2019s been about 4-5 days since. I click on the purchase and even says 4% of rewards has been given. Even the statuses say \u201ccompleted\u201d. But when I look at my XLM balance, nothings changed. Even in XLM history it doesn\u2019t show any of the cards purchases that say completed. Anyone else having this issue?",
