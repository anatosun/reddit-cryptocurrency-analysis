I don\u2019t value heroin any more than I value gold. I am not a jeweler or addict, but I know someone always values these things and will trade money for them, and if someone can use bitcoin to buy them, then via the transitive property, bitcoin is worth money. As long as it can be used to obtain something of value, and especially if it is the only or best way to obtain that thing, then it has value.\n\nWe say we want to build parallel economies, but those economies tend to be outlawed. So something that can continue to exist and be used in the face of being outlawed is truly resilient. We focus on means of exchange over store of value, but people need to value your thing in order to trade with you.\n\nSo, why do you think there are no BCH darknet markets? Would widespread awareness of Cash Fusion change this?",
