While these wallets are still available for send/receive transactions, they may not appear near the top of your Asset pages as they previously did.\n\nFor Coinbase.com/mobile - you can view these wallets by navigating to the bottom of the Assets page, search for the wallet via Trade, or select the wallet via the send/receive or deposit/withdraw flow.\n\nFor Coinbase Pro, because WLUNA/UST is no longer tradable, the value of these assets will no longer be available in total portfolio balance (this happens for any non-tradable asset, like XRP). You can also find these wallets by selecting the Send/Receive or Deposit/Withdraw options or navigating to Portfolios.\n\nThanks!",
