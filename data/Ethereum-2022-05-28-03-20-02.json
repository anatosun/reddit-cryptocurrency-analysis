            "selftext": "I am struggling to grasp why BTC has accrued more value than ETH since ETH has way more transactions/usage happening on it's network. I get that there is more of a scarcity model going on with the hard cap of BTC vs. the inflation of ETH but I would think that with so much more demand for usage the inflation would be cancelled out (especially with the anticipation of a higher burn rate through future usage coming up with ETH 2.0).  \n\n\nCan someone help me understand what factors (contributing to value accrual) I am missing here? Does it basically just come down to BTC being a first-mover and having better memes? Is it partially due to the higher costs per transaction on BTC?",

These lowered costs and higher velocities are positives for utility but apply negative price pressure. In fact, if the utility increases are significant enough, then the infrastructure costs of maintaining the network security are dependent upon the inflationary mechanisms which cause further price decreases. If the inflation-driven extraction of value from the coin holders and buyers isn\u2019t high enough to support infrastructure costs, then the size of the validator pool shrinks accordingly and the network\u2019s security and decentralization suffer, which further decreases the fair value of each ether. \n\nTL;DR: it doesn\u2019t matter how much you want to moon, the economics of a healthy utility network do not support this conclusion. If Ethereum succeeds, individual ether will be significantly cheaper and the moon potential of the coins decreases.\n\nMost here would call this counterintuitive, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s merely counterintuitive when you have some internal \u201cget rich\u201d narrative (even in the face of all logic which dictates that rising from $1 to $4000 was the \u201cget rich\u201d period, and that is in the past). When one\u2019s intuition is somehow trained o to completely irrational and mathematically unsubstantiated notions, which humans are prone to do, it can seem jarring, or even hostile to read this, but again, it\u2019s not. If you want Ethereum to succeed you want the world to have a great utility network and all of the things enabled by/invented because of it, not have another abusive toxic financial ecosystem geared around making legacy rent seekers lots of money.",

These lowered costs and higher velocities are positives for utility but apply negative price pressure.

L2s can allow higher velocity without applying negative price pressure or increasing the costs of network security. Please enlighten me",

The original purpose of bitcoin was to be used to do transactions online. It was very successful in the beginning at this. Now BTC has failed as a currency, because the price has gone too high and now people think it\u2019s a type of long term investment instead of spending it. ETH has utility beyond what bitcoin can ever do but it is still more volatile. ETH can\u2019t be used for transactions because it\u2019s price changes too wildly. Stablecoins will be the future of transactions.",

Technology and utility does not equal value, and high throughput will counteract the token value, at in the \"short\" term. Scaling issues particularly for both bitcoin and etherium actually helped them accure their value. Transactions being limited increases the value/scarcity of transactions. Higher throughput on the other hand frees up the network, lowers value of each individual transaction. creating less need/scarcity for the token.",
