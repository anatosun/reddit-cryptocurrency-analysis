You think binance does this for fun to piss their users who throws money at them? I for one like binance. Tried several cexs and binance is still one of the best. They have 2% card deposit fee. They have better visa debit card, in comparsion to cdc they have higher cap and you dont have to lock your bnb for 6 months. Staking options are another level compared to cdc, especially for smaller investor.",
