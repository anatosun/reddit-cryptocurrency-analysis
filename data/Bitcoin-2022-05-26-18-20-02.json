I see the huge long term upside potential and I understand short term volatility and risk. \n\nCurrently I DCA weekly but I also put into various other fiat retirement accounts. \n\nI'm curious, if you could afford $1,500 a month into any invenstment/account, would you spread it around (fiat markets/BTC) or all one or the other?\n\nThey always preach diversification but... I'm just not always sure anymore. \n\nDisclaimer: I'm not looking for financial advice just opinions. If you come in my dm's trying to scam me, just know in advance that I'm not sending you any amount of btc unless you send me half the amount you want first. You know, so I know you are for real. ; ) /sarcasm if you don't get it. Short version: I'm not falling for your bullshit. \n\nAlso, inflation sucks.",
