It's not like crypto owners are all 15 years old and have to be protected from themselves. \n\nCoinbase lowered the interest rate it was paying on (locked) stakes when the amount of incoming stakes leveled out. Now Coinbase has declared that people who have coins on deposit with them have a non-secured interest in those coins and Coinbase can use the deposits to pay off other creditors first in case of bankruptcy, etc. \n\nI just want to sever my relationship with Coinbase in light of what I feel is its behavior that is disadvantageous to me, and I'm unable to do that. I wouldn't mind transferring my stake to another company. That's why I am fed up with the lockup.\n\nBut I am getting fed up with the whole situation with Coinbase and the lengthy merge delays. So I might get out based on things seeming to be sketchy and in some cases predatory. IDK that the community is managing the professional ethics side well.",
