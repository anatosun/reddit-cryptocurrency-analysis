It's not like crypto owners are all 15 years old and have to be protected from themselves. \n\nCoinbase lowered the interest rate it was paying on (locked) stakes when the amount of incoming stakes leveled out. Now Coinbase has declared that people who have coins on deposit with them have a non-secured interest in those coins and Coinbase can use the deposits to pay off other creditors first in case of bankruptcy, etc. \n\nI just want to sever my relationship with Coinbase in light of what I feel is its behavior that is disadvantageous to me, and I'm unable to do that. I wouldn't mind transferring my stake to another company. That's why I am fed up with the lockup.\n\nBut I am getting fed up with the whole situation with Coinbase and the lengthy merge delays. So I might get out based on things seeming to be sketchy and in some cases predatory. IDK that the community is managing the professional ethics side well.",

Everyone who stakes with them was aware of the terms and warnings before they staked no one is being duped for failing to read their ToS, they were very explicit about lockup and that there was no timeline for withdrawals. Coinbase didn\u2019t just lower yield because they could, deposits to the beacon chain keep on increasing pushing yields down for everyone.  Depositors at every CEX and traditional institutions adhere to those same rules and are at the end of the line for payback if a default occurs, this is industry standard and nothing unique to coinbase, unless their deposits are sipc/fdic insured.",

A bankruptcy court may or may not accept their definition, but this is how Coinbase is choosing to define its depositors. \n\nMaybe you should check the headlines on this issue last week.

I actually have slowly been selling all my ETH to the point that I'm at like 1 ETH left now. ETH used to be my biggest bag but I really can't justify using it. \n\nThere are more critiques I have for it than high gas fees.. Ethereum had a first mover advantage and actually welcomed centralization in many aspects (think metamask and open sea). It has routinely done stuff to make the biggest holders richer and has proven that it's not immutable. \n\nThe fact that NFTs and FTs require smart contracts just makes for more attack vectors. The fact that dapps can use your signature to retroactively drain your wallet is crazy  to me.\n\nI do think it's a Blockchain full of holes and that's personally why  I have reduced my holdings to a fraction of what used to be.\n\nYou guys can downvote me to oblivion but the fundamentals are fundamentals.",

Personally I would have rather they adopted a different strategy for moving to proof of stake, moving to a PoW/PoS Hybrid model and slowly phasing out proof of work, rather than dropping them completely all at once. \n\nYou can say, \"You should have sold all your graphics cards before the merge, you knew it was coming!\" but that's not really a fair argument, SOMEONE has to mine ETH right up until the merge. If everyone followed that advice the network hashrate would plummet and anyone who wanted could execute a 51% attack against it. Slowly phasing out miners would have been a fair and far more graceful way of approaching this.",
