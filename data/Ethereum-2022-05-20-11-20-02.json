We just saw the UniSwap devs all get sued in a class action, and there are rumors the merge was August branded because there was a firm looking for lead plaintiffs to sue ETH heads for the beacon chain lockup and delayed merge. That's the trouble with centralized shit though. Terra Luna probably also put some fear into Vitalik. Too much responsibility as a centralized figure. Perfect exit.",
