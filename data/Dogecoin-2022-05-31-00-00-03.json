It\u2019s good time to get in as we are likely on the way to a rally and recovery from the market on Wednesday. \n\nI don\u2019t think we necessarily need to know \u201cwhy\u201d it tanked per se, but we need to look at perceived value of the coins that were making the bull run. If you believe in Dogecoin and you\u2019re here because you want to, get your toes wet. \n\nThis is my strategy, but this is mine due to not being educated in the financial worlds, so this is not \u201cadvice\u201d or anything, I just do this to save my butt since it seems practical.\n\n1. Figure out what you can indeed afford to lose.\n2. Cut that in half and go in blind.\n3. Hold your other half for dips, so you can feel more comfortable averaging your position down if it dips.\n4. I have NO solution however, for not buying \u201cenough\u201d at the lowest point with this strategy. I\u2019ve already told myself I was an idiot for not going all in more at 22 cents a month ago. I only did half of my $500 lol",
