When the Silk Road marketplace first began the creator and administrators instituted terms of service that prohibited the sale of anything whose purpose was to \"harm or defraud\".[19][80] This included child pornography, stolen credit cards, assassinations, and weapons of any type; other darknet markets such as Black Market Reloaded gained user notoriety because they were not as restrictive on these items as the Silk Road incarnations were.\"*\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)",

If you tune in to the all core dev calls every other friday, you'll notice he barely ever speaks anymore. All that's left on the merge is implementation and testing, something he really has no control over. If you wanna pin the efforts on one guy it'd be Tim Beiko, who's job is to coordinate these calls and ensure everything runs smoothly and everyone's clear on what needs to be done.\n\nThese days Vitalik is really just a part of the research team, and at best his influence over governance/development is through being very knowledgeable. Otherwise he works on the theoretical specs for future upgrades, same as any other member of the research team.",
