I knew I had to look out for the network of course, as the $USDC adress of Coinbase only accepts ERC-20 tokens.\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that when you convert your crypto to USD Stable Coin on [gate.io](https://gate.io/)\n\n, you can withdraw several USD stable coins such as $HUSD, $BUSD, $TUSD and $USDC. I just looked at the network (ERC-20) and thought I withdrawed $USDC. Unfortunately, it turned out later that I had withdrawed the ERC-20 $HUSD. Yes, I know this is my fault and that I should have tried a small transaction first, but I can't change it anymore.\n\nCoinbase has not listed $HUSD and says they cannot return the tokens. The tokens are only credited automatically when Coinbase lists $HUSD on their exchange.\n\nI emailed the Huobi Trust CEO about this, as Huobi is the exchange behind stablecoin $HUSD (just like Binance is the exchange behind stablecoin $BUSD and Coinbase is the exchange behind stablecoin $USDC). He said the following:\n\n***'We will continue to work hard to communicate with coinbase. But I can't be sure when $HUSD will be listed. But you do have the right to find coinbase to recover your assets. If any customer mistakenly deposits a token that is not listed on Huobi, Huobi will assist in retrieving it, or even advance payment. In fact, you did deposit your assets into the coinbase address. I believe that as long as you keep looking for them to solve the problem, they will help you. After all, $35,000 is not a small sum. Good luck.'***\n\nSee my transaction on etherscan:  \n [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x12a231dc8801724334895452f41dce8cb621d2db584c969bbe3c7fa6b9efa78d](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x12a231dc8801724334895452f41dce8cb621d2db584c969bbe3c7fa6b9efa78d)",
