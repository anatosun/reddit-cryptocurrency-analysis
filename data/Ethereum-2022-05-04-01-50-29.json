            "selftext": "As the merge approaches, more news and poorly informed crypto-journalist articles will come out, signaling to more people that it *is* indeed close, and this will bring more Proof-of-Stake related questions and discussions rehashing the same topics and same misconceptions. I've already seen this to a degree with last week's announcement that the Kiln testnet successfully merged, and I expect to see much more of the same stuff going forward so here are a bunch of common questions/takes I see, boiled down in quick bullet points like I did in [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/s8mnwb/a_collection_of_various_things_the_average/) that was more about Ethereum in general.\n\nI plan on lazily linking this thread whenever I see those points being brought up, and I encourage everyone to do the same and correct me if I got anything wrong or suggest any addition.\n\n## Wat merge?\n\nA lot more info can be found on [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) so I will keep this section light\n\n* When the merge happens, Ethereum will be secured by Proof of Stake instead of Proof of Work.\n\n* The Merge is not \"ETH 2.0\", there is no ETH 2.0, [it's an obsolete term.](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/24/the-great-eth2-renaming/)\n\n* **If you currently hold ETH, you don't need to do anything.** You will still hold the same amount of ETH after the merge, there is no \"ETH2 coin\", no need to migrate anything, etc. Everything sames exactly the same, only the consensus mechanism changes under the hood.\n\n* It's called \"merge\" because it's about *merging* the Beacon Chain (*consensus layer*) with the current chain (*execution layer*) and ditching the proof of work part of the execution layer.\n\n* If you don't know, \"consensus\" is just a fancy word for the goal of ordering transactions and getting some economic guarantee that this order won't change. Both PoW and PoS achieve consensus by different means:\n\n  * PoW: \"It costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, playing by the rules is more lucrative.\"\n\n  * PoS: \"It costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, because if I do I'll lose all the money I put up as collateral.\"\n\n* Since it's only the consensus mechanism changing, **Proof of Stake by itself will not lower gas fees significantly**.\n\n## Why merge?\n\n* Lower security costs since there's less energy needed to achieve consensus.\n\n  * For PoW you need miners to be able to *at least* cover all the hardware and energy they use otherwise no one will mine. This requires a big issuance that is quickly sold for fiat to pay the bills.\n  \n  * For PoS you just need to give some yield to stakers to make people want to deposit capital rather than just invest it elsewhere. No big bills to pay beyond an ordinary computer and an internet connection, so the yield just has to reflect the opportunity costs and risks involved.\n\n* More sustainability:\n\n  * The security of a blockchain is basically proportional to the value of its coin. This is true for both PoW (more valuable coin rewards = more reasons to play by the rules = more miners = harder to mess up the consensus) and PoS (more valuable staked coins = more reasons to play by the rules to avoid losing the staked coins)\n\n  * A newly issued coin is essentially value being taken from all holders of the coin and being redistributed to someone. All else equal, selling that coin for fiat extracts value out of the network.\n\n* It opens the door for many scaling solutions in the future, namely data sharding, statelessness, light clients, and [more](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402)\n\n* It helps reduce some complexity of the code going forward, by separating concerns between execution and consensus.\n\n* Appeasing the environment and gamers is certainly a nice side-effect, but not really a major reason behind the switch to PoS, since it's mostly about externalities over which Ethereum as a protocol doesn't have much control (source of energy production, GPU supply chains, etc.)\n\n## Wen merge?\n\n* **There is no official date announced yet**. Just cautiously optimistic devs and community hoping for mid-June [for various reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/tbql1n/five_indicators_that_the_ethereum_merge_will/)\n\n* Testing is still ongoing, the merge will not be shipped until developpers are fully confident that nothing will go wrong.\n\n* I personally don't set my hopes up for June, but I definitely expect it over the summer, with the asterisk of \"unless something went extremely wrong during testing\" (e.g. a critical bug requiring weeks to fix, possible exploit in the specification itself require months of fixing and reimplementing)\n\n* The difficulty bomb is set to go off in June, so there **will** be a hard-fork around that time, with or without the merge.\n\n* I suggest bookmarking [wenmerge.com](https://wenmerge.com/) for a quick view of the latest estimates for each testnet merge that will lead up to mainnet merge, as they are announced.\n\n## Nope, your a idiot. They will delay it like they always have in the past. They promised it years ago and still haven't delivered.\n\n* Some useless sementics first: there is no official date announced yet, and there never was. Can't have a delay on a deadline that never existed in the first place\n\n* The quotes along the lines of \"Ethereum will switch to proof of stake by 2018\" came from a place of extreme optimism and of underestimating the complexity of not only a secure PoS design, but also a safe transition from PoW to PoS. The work done back then amounted to a partially finished specification for Casper FFG, a hybrid PoW-PoS mechanism that ended up being scrapped. But a lot is different today. None of these applied back then, but they do today:\n\n  * There is a full protocol specification written that went through years of research, analysis of possible attack vectors and refinements\n\n  * Client implementations are all done, it's all about testing now\n\n  * It's all hands on deck on the merge, there is literally no other work being done other than the merge. All the necessary steps to lead to the merge are done. It's not even \"they're done implementing complex stuff like EIP1559, so more attention can now be focused on the merge\", it's: \"**all** the attention is focused on the merge\". There is no possible world where the merge \"gets delayed again\" and the devs start working on other stuff on the side. Until the merge is done, nothing else gets done. \n\n  * **PoS is literally running as we speak** in the form of the [Beacon Chain](https://beaconcha.in/) since December 2020. That's over a year of Ethereum's PoS getting battle tested in production (to a degree) with currently over 10 million ETH on the line. It just isn't producing blocks for the execution layer yet.\n\n## Those millions of ETH staked will crash the price the very moment they're unlocked LOL\n\nFor sure, there will be plenty of stakers who will want to finally take profit, especially those who locked their ETH back when 32 ETH was worth $10k. But there's plenty more to consider on the other side of the equation:\n\n* The merge doesn't unlock any ETH. Withdrawals will come in the first hard fork following the merge, likely 6-8 months after. That's months of no proof of work issuance (~13k ETH/day) being sold off *and* no proof of stake issuance coming into circulation.\n\n* Just like how there's a queue to deposit ETH, there will be [a queue to withdraw it.](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/beacon-chain.md#how-does-eth2-proof-of-stake-work). Assuming a mass sell-off event, everyone is in that queue, limited at a rate of 1125 valitors per day. So there's no \"opening the floodgates\" moment. Everyone unstaking would literally take over a year. A year of ~38k ETH/day entering back into circulation (or... roughly 1% of average daily volume)\n\n* After the merge, validators will start receiving fee rewards as well, doubling the yield [by some estimates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vrK5sY5ooq-F8dcyRhmmAJ5YtgkvWKWP3OfGCZIYxSA/edit#gid=0). There are thousands of people waiting in line to stake *right now*. They're okay with a 5% yield on their ETH, I don't think they're gonna yeet the moment it becomes 10% lol\n\n* The biggest risk involved in staking is *by far* the merge. Something catastrophic could go wrong, yet people have been staking and locking up their ETH for over a year despite this risk and despite the ETH being locked until an unknown floating date. How many people/institutions are waiting on the sidelines for this risk to disappear before jumping in?\n\n* And don't forget stakers exiting means fewer validators which means higher rewards for the stakers who don't exit. It also means more incentives for other people to *start* staking if they weren't before...\n\n* But of course it's crypto, and crypto's gonna crypto. The merge will bring excitement and volatility and possibly a sell-the-news dip, who knows. I don't pretend to know the future, but the way I see it it's much more likely way more ETH will flow *into* staking than out of it.\n\n## If proof of stake is so good, then how come Ethereum didn't go with that from the start?\n\n* Proof of Work is easy to conceptualize and implement, Proof of Stake isn't. Especially when back in 2014 it was mostly a theoretical concept still being researched, with some blockchain implementing some version of it.\n\n* There were several fundamental problems with PoS that needed to be overcome from a research perspective before thinking about implementing it. \n\n* There is no one-size-fits-all for Proof of Stake. Every PoS blockchain comes with its own PoS specification that has pros and cons on various aspects, so it's not as simple as \"but this other blockchain did it, why can't ethereum just do the same thing\"\n\n* Starting as a proof of work chain had the benefit of letting anyone mine coins on their own without anyone's permission, which helped the coin distribution become way better than those newer chains that are proof of stake from the start and have to decide how to allocate the initial coins, which can't really be done permissionlessly.\n\n* Related to above: Yes, there was still a premine/presale for Ethereum, but it has now been diluted to half the supply after years of mining and multiple bull/bear cycles making that ETH swap hands, bringing the distribution [closer to Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). So it's not that big of a deal in 2022 when Ether as an asset is extremely liquid and easy to acquire. \n\n## Nah, this is really just a ploy to screw over the miners one last time after years of hard work\n\n* PoS has been the eventual goal since [day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale/), everyone mining was always aware that it would end one day. There is no rugpull or unfairness going on here.\n\n* Economic factors trump any kind of miner-blockchain loyalty. You can kinda view the blockchain as a business and the miners as employees:\n\n  * Miners/employees have been paid for the service they provide (namely, secure consensus) with the block rewards. The paycheck is an expense for the employer and it comes from diluting the value of existing coins from holders (see above in \"why merge?\")\n\n  * Miners go to the chain offering the highest rewards, most of them would ditch Ethereum in a heartbeat if another GPU minable coin gave out more rewards. \n\n  * Similarly, Ethereum will pay less for the service it requires if stakers can do it for way cheaper. \n\n* It's not entirely exclusive. Miners can also be holders of the coin, and users of the blockchain. Nothing prevents them from holding their rewards and becoming stakers too.\n\n## The coin stops having inherent value if you're not spending real world energy to mine it\n\nI don't really buy this argument. There is nothing magical about computing hashes over and over until you land on one that fits arbitrary requirements. I mean, you could have a proof of work blockchain where the work is done by solving sudoku puzzles and it would work exactly the same: NP-complete problem, hard to compute one way but easy to verify a solution once one has been found. That doesn't mean solving sudoku inherently brings value into the world. Cranking up the mining difficulty of a coin doesn't magically make everyone richer, it just makes mining less profitable \u2013 unless of course demand goes up too, which so far hasn't been too much of a problem in the crypto world.\n\nThe way I see it, the value of a coin ultimately comes from supply and demand, and the demand comes from how valuable the blockspace is. People need ETH to buy the blockspace, regardless of whether that ETH is generated by a miner or a staker. Sure, the more miners there are the higher the security/decentralization which further increases the value proposition of the blockspace in a positive feedback loop, but [feedback loops exist in Proof of Stake Ethereum too](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png) and they're super cool too!\n\n## Proof of Stake is a recipe for total centralization\n\n* It's basically the same as Proof of Work but slightly different. \"Better\" or \"worse\" really depends on your opinion. The way I see it, PoW is really just PoS with extra steps.\n\n* Ethereum as a community values decentralization highly, any potential centralization vector is addressed by the research team to come up with ways to mitigate it, even if it's at the cost of other important stuff like scaling (e.g. keeping gas limits low so more nodes can participate in decentralization, even if that results in congestion and high fees)\n\n* There **are** shortcomings currently, decentralization is a spectrum and a process and we're not there yet, and for the time being there are many centralization crutches that need to go away on the long term. That said, none of these crutches represent existential risks for the network, and for practically any \"it's centralized because X\" statement, there is an item on [the roadmap](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402) addressing X. I personally find it much more fascinating to come up with a whole bunch of stuff to solve X rather than give up and say \"it can't be done because of X\". \n\n* Something interesting about Ethereum's PoS design that is often overlooked: Quadratic penalties. A single validator going down, messing up, or downright attacking the network doesn't get penalized very badly. A thousand validators doing it at the same time get penalized much more heavily. \n\n  * This means that if you're a megawhale with thousands of validators, it's in your own best interest to spread them out, avoid cloud hosting, use different clients, etc. Sure, the capital is still concentrated, but at least the points of failures are distributed which is good for the health of the network overall.\n\n  * Compared to a big mining operation that relies on a central location to amortize costs, which can be spotted from energy usage and shut down if the authorities don't like it. It's hard to move mining equipment across the world, but staking only relies on private/public keys and not any actual hardware beyond a consumer grade computer.\n\n## PoS is really just \"who has money makes more money\"\n\n* Yes. Unfortunately we live in a world of high wealth inequality. Blockchains don't fix that. \n\n* It's also true of proof of work: Whoever has money can buy more mining rigs and make more money. Except with mining, the ROI becomes better with economies of scale: Centralized mining operations have the big bucks to get bulk/discount rates on hardware and move to the places with cheap electricity. The solo miner simply can't realistically compete. With Proof of Stake, everyone earns the same yield proportionally, where they stake $10 or $10M.\n\n* \"*They may be centralized, but those big mining operations have no reason to attack the network and weaken it since they dumped millions in infrastructure*\"....... so you're saying you're fine with big centralized actors existing, as long as they have some kind of a big *stake* in the network?\n\n## Passive interest on your deposit though? Printing money out of thin air? That's literally central banks and fiat part 2 electric boogaloo\n\n* You have to really stretch it to make this case, but I've seen people do that lol. Those takes usually begin with \"proof of stake is nothing new\"\n\n* There's still \"work\" being done by validators: creating blocks and validating other blocks. It's just that the work done is composed entirely of the *actually useful work* that the blockchain needs to reach consensus, instead of computing hashes over and over again until one of them meets an arbitrary requirement. \n\n* It's not really \"free money being printed out of thin air\", there are still costs involved in staking capital, they're just more abstract and less direct than energy bills:\n\n  * Opportunity costs \u2013 Why stake at all if another investment offers you a better yield?\n\n  * Illiquidity \u2013 From the moment you deposit, your capital is locked up, queued up until your validator is active, then when you withdraw there is yet another queue before getting it back.\n\n  * Inherent risks \u2013 It's still a fairly new thing, something could go wrong, there could be a critical bug, network could get attacked, your staking hardware could get compromised, etc.\n\n  * Volatility \u2013 at the end of the day it's still a volatile asset, if you're the kind of investor who denominates their investments in their country's fiat currency, then a 5% yield on an asset that can drop 30% overnight isn't all that great (the upside of 5% yield on an asset that doubles is pretty great though, turn that 100% gain into 110%)\n\n  * Maintenance \u2013 You still have to maintain and secure your validator, ensure 100% uptime, update software, etc. \n\n* Here's where it gets nifty: The more stakers there are, the lower the individual rewards get. This basically means that all those costs above will get priced by the market itself. It's easy to see why: If the staking yield is too low, then the rewards don't justify the costs and people will pull out and invest elsewhere, bringing the yield back up. Likewise if it's too high, that'll attract more capital and bring it back down. \n\n* As far as inflation goes: Let's say the market as a whole decides that 5% is the ideal yield, of which 3% comes from issuance. That works out to about 30 million ETH staked printing 900 thousand new ETH per year. At a total supply of 120 million ETH, that's an inflation rate of 0.75%. Which is outpaced by EIP1559 burn as long as gas fees are at least 23 gwei. (I cannot stress this enough: *Ether-the-asset will become a yield-bearing deflationary asset very soon*)\n\n* \"*Nice math but there's no supply cap + they change the monetary policy all the time*\" \n\n  * The goal has been \"minimum viable issuance to secure the network\" for years, priorizing network security over an arbitrary supply cap.\n  \n  * No update to the monetary policy has ever increased supply inflation. Low inflation rate (specifically *dis*inflation) has been the goal since day 1.\n\n  * There will be an equilibrium acting as an effective supply cap \u2013 decided again by market forces valuing Ethereum's blockspace \u2013 once the rate of EIP1559 burn matches the rate of issuance. That's super nifty if you ask me.\n\n* So yeah, there's no \"central Ethereum bank\" adjusting rates arbitrarily and printing money to cronies. The market itself dictates how much inflation/deflation there is, no single entity can control it the way a central bank controls fiat inflation rates.\n\n## Whales have all the money needed to take over and change the rules and slash honest stakers\n\n* No. Ethereum has no on-chain governance of any kind for this reason. Protocol updates are a community effort (*Layer 0*) and you don't need any money staked to call out bad ideas and participate in the process.\n\n* This is exactly the same as Proof of Work: Even if you have 99% of the hashpower, you can't make invalid transactions that steal people's money without their private keys, or change protocol rules, or really do anything beyond reorganizing blocks. The 1% of honest nodes will reject any block that don't follow the rules and you'll be mining on an invalid/useless chain. Now replace hashpower/mining with stake/staking and the same holds true for Proof of Stake (with the difference that someone caught reorganizing blocks will have their entire stake destroyed, whereas the blockchain can't exactly destroy mining rigs)\n\n* And simply put, there is a fuckton of ETH involved. 10 million and counting and that's *before the merge*. At current prices that's roughly 30 billion dollars. Both \"amount of ETH staked\" and \"value of ETH\" are projected to go up, so attacks become increasingly unlikely due to the sheer economic cost involved in doing an attack \u2014 *once* \u2014 and the absurdity of acquiring that much ETH in the first place if the attack comes from an outside actor (where would you buy 10 million ETH to have 51% of the stake? 20M?)\n\n## 32 ETH is way too much, the average person doesn't have that much\n\n* I agree it's a lot. There are some ideas of how it could be lowered ([better signature aggregation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrmt6o0/) or [a rotating cap of active validators](https://ethresear.ch/t/simplified-active-validator-cap-and-rotation-proposal/9022)) but they don't seem to be very high on the priority list currently, as opposed to making sure the base layer is truly secure.\n\n* The reason for such a high number is it has to fall in a technical sweetspot. In a nutshell, it has to be low enough to be accessible and have enough validators to secure the chain, but high enough to not have too many validators and bloat the chain with overhead. And having a fixed amount for each validator reduces a lot of the complexity by having each validator weighted exactly the same in the distributed randomness process of who gets to produce each block.\n\n* There is a whole bunch of [math involved](https://thomasborgers.medium.com/ethereum-2-0-economic-review-1fc4a9b8c2d9) to arrive at 32 ETH from a technical standpoint, back when 32 ETH was worth about 7000 USD. [Earlier math from 2017](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735) even suggested over 1000 ETH minimum. \n\n* Thankfully, just like mining pools exist, there are staking pools to allow staking in smaller amounts. It doesn't necessarily fly in the face of the \"not your keys not your coins\" mantra, thanks to things like [RocketPool](https://rocketpool.net/), [Secret Shared Validators](https://medium.com/coinmonks/secret-shared-validators-on-ethereum-2-0-ea29ab380016) (not yet launched) which use smart contracts to be permissionless, decentralized and non-custodian. And because of the quadratic penalties mentioned above, I believe decentralized staking operations will outperform the centralized ones on the long run. I recommend superphiz's [guide to staking](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/t1xpr5/how_to_stake_on_ethereum_march_2022_edition/) for more info. And obviously, I admit staking through exchanges is yucky if you value decentralization\n\n* Related to above, stuff like Rocket Pool is better viewed as a higher-level abstraction to base staking, rather than \"just a staking pool\". I go into more details on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/tijcq1/stuff_rethereum_should_know_proof_of_stake_edition/i1gd27b/?context=1) for those interested.\n\n## PoS hasn't been proven, while we know PoW works\n\nThat's actually totally fair and there is no real rebuttal to this, obviously. Only time will tell. I just think it's irrelevant in the context that Ethereum *is* switching to PoS and was always going to. If you don't believe in it, don't participate/invest in it. I do personally believe in a long term sustainable PoS Ethereum, but even then I'm glad good ol' boring-by-design Bitcoin will be there chugging its proof of work along.\n\nIt's all part of the great crypto experiment of our lifetime. Either it's just a fad and will fail into obscurity, which would be a bummer for sure, or we'll have succeeded in creating monster robust networks capable of outlasting humanity. To achieve that, prioritizing decentralization is key. Which is something I mainly just see in Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite the widely different philosophies. It's why I'm glad to have both to truly see what's what on the long term.\n\n## I have more questions\n\nidk ask them in the comments, I'm sure I forgot stuff. But plz be polite",

I agree its quite the opposite, with PoS if a guy is 100x richer than you, he gets 100x more rewards. With PoW the guy who is 100x richer than you have the ability and social networking to buy more and cheaper rigs and to secure much cheaper electricity, so at the end he gets much more than 100x rewards.\n\nThis also hits decentralisation at a different angle by centralizing mining at big mining facilities at places with cheap electricity, and the effect of this was seen during the Xinjiang blackout when the Bitcoin network lost over 45% of its hash rate.\n\nAt that moment in time, all China needed to do to take over the Bitcoin network was to take control over the big chinese mining facilities and turn them against the network with impunity because there is no defense mechanism with PoW. With PoS unlike PoW, nobody knows where the validators are and you get slashed if you want to play dirty.\n\nWant to add also that after The Merge, even if there is sell the news event, circulating ETH will suffer a huge supply shock comparable to 2-3 Bitcoin halvenings at once and in the next few months the price will start rising quite fast till it reaches it's new equilibrium.\n\nI don't believe in the sell the news event thesis, quite the opposite, a successful merge will send shockwaves not only through the crypto world but outside aswell.\n\nPoS has a very strong environmental narrative and The Merge will reignite the retail investor interest in the Ethereum network.",

If I just accept the premise that a random number is selected or a random grouping is determined, etc., I think I mostly follow the rest, but I'm having trouble understanding how there is consensus about the random number/order/grouping. Like I can understand how one computer can generate a random number (although more complex than it sounds) but how does the whole network agree on a \"random\" input? How can we verify randomness (fairness)? Wouldn't a single node have to \"propose\" this random input?\n\nI know my understanding must be flawed/incomplete because it seems to me that you need a consensus for the inputs required for consensus, which just leads me into this recursive path back to the original problem.

Wouldn't a single node have to \"propose\" this random input?\n\nThe way I understand it, it's a series of commit-and-reveal schemes where everyone participates by picking a random number and merging them together and using that as the seed of a pseudo-random number generator.\n\nTo avoid biasing and gaming the PRNG algorithm, each node has to broadcast the hash of their random number beforehand, so they're committed to their random number before they know everyone else's number. Then once the process is done, the whole thing is deterministic, you can work out the seed from everyone's number and verify the randomness happened like it was supposed to.\n\nIt's a bit more complicated than that but it's the gist of it, you can read about it from Vitalik's annotated specs [here](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/beacon-chain.md#aside-randao-seeds-and-committee-generation)",

Even though they're nothing alike, that output is the deterministic result of sending that input through that series of math operations, such that if you were to send that exact same input through again, you would get the exact same output.\n\nIn doing so, you can turn an input into an output that appears to be random to us, but if you were to repeat it for a second time, then it would produce the same output, breaking the illusion. To address this, you can either feed that output back into the same series of math operations as a new input, or tie the input to something that changes, such as the current time.\n\n*This* is what I think allows all participants in the network to produce the same random output: they're feeding the same data in as the input, likely the block or epoch counter. Although every participant produces the same random output, it appears to be random every time it's generated, and will produce different results over time, as the input is changing.",

It currently looks like [EIP-4844](https://www.eip4844.com/) will be implemented first, laying the groundwork for cheap \"blob\" transactions until true data sharding is here. Any rollup adapting to EIP-4844 won't have to do any additional upgrade to be compatible with sharding when it rolls out. Details beyond that are super technical though",

Someone with enough ETH to perform a significant attack would be stuck for weeks/months, which is more than enough time for other validators to notice and slash their ETH. You don't want people to deposit, attack, then immediately withdraw before any of the actual consequences\n\n>Do you mean ~38k validators yearly or ~38k ETH daily?\n\nI worded that all wrong, I meant a year of ~38k ETH/day. I edited the post to make it clearer, thanks",

I like to think of rollups like Arbitrum or zkSync as blockchains within a blockchain- they're basically just smart contracts living in Ethereum. The off-chain rollup network processes transactions quickly and then just posts the results to Ethereum. \n\nA sidechain like AVAX is basically just a fork of Ethereum with its own validators and assets, completely separate except for whatever bridges might be created there. \n\nThe most important difference is that if you bridge assets to AVAX and it goes down, you're screwed. If you bridge assets to zkSync and it goes down, you can still withdraw funds.\n\nEdit: I've been advised that this isn't suitable for 5-year olds, so to borrow an analogy from /u/goosemay0 a rollup is a lot like a cheesy rollup from Taco Bell. The shredded cheese inside is the bunch of transactions executed on the L2 rollup, the tortilla is the batch they're put in by the L2 infrastructure, and the grilling process is any extra compression or proving that must be done to get it into an acceptable format for consumption. When you (Ethereum) eat it, you're adding it to your body (state) so that the cheese (transactions) will always exist within you in some form. \n\nA sidechain is like if your friend was eating shredded cheese off by himself, and maybe sometimes you share some together (a bridge). \n\nThis has been an extremely strange analogy but I hope it makes things clearer.",

Sending each letter individually because (in this imaginary world) the box of each package makes up much more of the package's weight than its contents. People are tired of buying their own boxes.\n\nSo an alternative Letter 2 system is set up. It allows you to send packages to it that are much smaller and lighter. It then takes the contents of all these packages and puts them together in a big box and forwards it on to the main, Letter 1 processing centre. Each package ends up being processed by original processing centre but slightly delayed. In return, users can split the cost of the expensive packaging that the original processing centre demands, instead of paying for it all alone.",

You can very well execute programs that crash. It's expected and completely normal. And no one would assume it to be possible to get back the electricity you've consumed for such crash to happen. You don't call your hardware manufacturer for this kind of problem. \n\nInstead, you call your software publisher. Here, it's your smart contract owner. So, ask them why their contract failed, because it shouldn't have. \n\nThat said, the problem is that users bear the cost of a failed smart contract, when it should be smart contract owners.\n\nBut this is having a solution on the work: sponsorised transactions. With this, smart contract owners can technically ask for a fixed quantity of gas from users and bear the cost of the inefficiencies of their own transactions in terms of gas limit. This way, you're sure you're not paying for a ridiculous amount of gas. \n\nIt's just that sponsorised transactions, like many other features, don't have the priority, right now, for obvious reasons. \n\n>Chains with UTXO have a clear advantage for this - if it\u2019s accepted it means it\u2019ll go through.\n\nAnd a very obvious vulnerability thanks to it: the famous dust attack. \n\nGood luck trying to advertise your safe from failure computer. I wouldn't expect it to become a trend, as History has proven.",

Your own C# compiler\u2019s execution isn\u2019t dependant on the amount of compiling being done in your neighborhood, and the eth contract execution also doesn\u2019t crash because of a problem in the code, but because of a lack of ressources. There isn\u2019t much examples that I can think of in the real world that behave like eth that charge for incomplete jobs. Maybe shady contractors that ghost you after doing half the work and then disappearing with your money :)\n\nThe \u2018dust attack\u2019 is also trivial to work around. Any wallet with utxo management can mark any dust as unspendable to prevent it from being mixed in your transactions. \n\nSponsorized transactions are a cool thing but why doesn\u2019t the NFT owner just premint all their tokens instead and just sell/transfer them after? Looks like they just want to offload the minting costs to end users and the sponsorized transactions won\u2019t get much traction in the future.",

Far more useful than being hacked for $200mm. To give you an idea, net issuance today was -64000 ETH (minus, negative), whereas earlier this week was around +9000 ETH/day. The most negative daily net issuance before today was -5900 ETH on 10 Jan 2022. Today it was close to 11x that (might go lower still). A striking display of the effects and implications of burning.\n\nAlso evidence of how hungry and willing people are to use Ethereum, despite slow speeds or high fees.

In fact, bots will often start spamming transactions whenever there's a time-sensitive transaction, like an NFT drop or liquidation.\n\nSo how does Solana handle this?\n\nWell... it doesn't.

And ETH can get away with just 5M$/day block reward after the merge while bitcoin pays 35M$/day.   The reason is that in Bitcoin most of the rewards is going into electricity and for the depreciation of the hardware, while in Ethereum the operating costs are much lower and the rewards are mainly passive income for your stake.\n\nThe argument against POS is that you can rewrite history at no cost, if you had a majority stake in the past.   However, you can only do that after you withdrew your money (or it will be very costly) and everybody who has been online all the time is ignoring your shadow chain.  You can only fool new clients that come online and they would still see the two conflicting chains and know some attack is happening.\n\nAnd a successful POW attack may not even come at a big cost, as you get the block rewards if your chain wins.",

PoS has more to prove IMO.\n\nWhichever one leads us to increased decentralisation to resist against the authority of ossified power structures, then that's the one I'll back. I think we need both, and I think the Ethereum community should not side with power brokers that are trying to undermine Bitcoin, which is what they're doing when they support this corporate \"ESG\" vector of attack on Bitcoin technology.",

POS does not suffer from this problem because the staked coins don't need to be spent so the security of a POS chain does not depend on the issuance. In POW you prove that you have a lot of money by spending a lot of money whereas in POS you prove that have a lot of money by proving that you own a lot of coins on-chain.",

I know nothing about code at all, I'm a marketer.\n\nI'm 23 years old and lately I've been fantasising with the idea of learning web3 development, mainly because I'm very deep into the NFT ecosystem (and also seeing how much these developers make is tempting, not gonna lie).\n\nI've always been quite capable, not a genius or anything but I'm not dumb either, in case this is important (is it?).\n\nSo I guess you can imagine my questions... How do I start this journey? Would you recommend it or maybe I should focus on web3 marketing? How hard is it? Can you do this without formal education? And how many years of learning would I need in order to get a job doing this? \n\nI'd love your comments and advice in general. I've a feeling that this post is extremely naive from me but I guess you need to start somewhere, right? Thanks for your help!",

I guess I started to make money after 4 months and keep working on front-end development for almost a year. \n\nThen you know web3 hype is started and I wanted to follow it. Watch some courses, followed buildspace, etc. I'm able to make dapp and I'm mostly focusing on the front-end side of web3. Fetching data from smart contracts, etc.\n\nI think web3 developer and solidity developer are different and I guess that's called full-stack web3. Solidity is another universe and I'm not familiar with it but being a web3 developer is not that hard.\n\nI'm also not a genius. Not even close. I don't even call myself smart but I worked hard, to be honest. I almost watched every single possible video on youtube about front-end development. We are not reinventing the wheel in the end. I watched too many videos and learned the basics, fundamentals, best practices, and advanced projects. I'm still working with the web2 company but trying to have some web3 freelance projects so I can improve my skills.\n\nI can give you a quick roadmap and it's pretty solid for both web2 and web3.\n\nHTML > CSS > Tailwind CSS > Javascript Basics > Some basic javascript skills for React > Typescript > React > Next > GraphQL > Web3 libraries\n\nThat's it. Easier than it looks.  \n\n\nMy DM is open and you can ask me anything.",

Understanding solidity made me stand out during the interview process. Took me 4 months to get a job, I got interviews immediately when I started looking because of my coding knowledge.\n\nI was taking courses for about 4 hours a day. My job at the time was kind of easy so I had a lot of free time.\n\nAll of these languages take a long time (years) to learn and be an expert. Just be committed to learning and stay consistent. If you need to pay for structured courses id recommend it. If you don\u2019t like a specific instructor, ditch them for one you vibe with. \n\nGood luck",

If you really, really want to be absolutely sure it goes through in the next block, you can set it as high as you like, you'll only get charged whatever the standard fee for that block is.\n\nIf you don't mind waiting an hour or two and in the worst case coming back and bumping the fee, knock 25% off whatever metamask suggests.",

Polkadot isn't all that different from Ethereum to be considered in an entirely different category. From what I've seen, \"Layer 0\" in this context is just a fancy term for a bridge network. \n\nAnd also, Polygon is not a layer 2, it's an L1 sidechain. Polygon Hermez is a proper layer 2 deriving security from Ethereum, but nobody uses it and their other layer 2 solutions aren't live yet. \n\n> Will Ethereum be the king finally?\n\nHopefully, that's certainly how I've allocated my investments anyway haha. \n\n> Will Eth2.0 actually happen because of the other Layer2 that are solving the problem for Eth. And if ETH2.0 does happen, what comes of the LayerZero and Layer2 superstars?\n\nI think you're confused about some things here. First, [there's no such thing as ETH2.0](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/24/the-great-eth2-renaming/). Second, \"layer 2\" solutions and their cousins (rollups/validiums/volitions) *are* the future of Ethereum. The Ethereum network is going all-in on scaling them with the \"rollup-centric roadmap\". Hopefully next year we'll get the release of some scaling updates like proto-danksharding to supercharge existing rollups, but time will tell. \n\nAs for what happens with \"layer zeros\", I think they go the way of EOS unless they pivot to supporting Ethereum rollups in some manner. Proper layer 2 solutions like zkSync will be wildly successful.",

Polygon most likely will be around for some time too.\n\nL0 aka interoperability is different thing. I'm pretty sure that this space is the one that will be hit with regulation and it kind of needs to happen for bigger adoption (you can't expect people to learn how to use adressess etc., just look how much scams and lost funds there are already).

In fact, the merge will most probably drive more activity on the platform making traffic worse which might theoretically increase the demand on scaling solutions overall.\n\nThe end goal is to reach ETH2.0 which is a phenomenally more advanced version of the Ethereum we have now. But that will happen in slow steps and phases. Part of these steps is lowering energy consumption which is the whole idea behind the merge from PoW to PoS.\n\nFor now keep your L2 tokens and maybe even accumulate more to cash in on a decent profit. Personally I\u2019m betting my money on Polygon. They already have the largest number of daily active users between all scaling solutions plus it kinda easiest to build on seeing that they already have 19,000 dApps onboard.\n\nI also think Optimism might have a chance at making it big especially after the recent updates with the token release but I tend to lean more towards zk tech honestly cause I personally think it\u2019s much more superior and has more potential for the long term.",

On Friday, three Ethereum domains were basically introduced to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control or OFAC sanctions database. Among those three Ethereum, one address was actually named last week. The US authorities linked to the loss of about $610 million in cryptocurrency from Axie Infinity's Ronin bridge. \n\nOver the previous week, all three accounts had received large incoming transactions. That money is basically looted ether (ETH) from the officially sanctioned wallet. North Korea's Lazarus hackers squad, according to the FBI as well as OFAC, has been diverting funds. They were transferring them from a permitted account to an intermediate address prior to actually transferring the cash to Tornado Cash. Tornado Cash is a mixer intended to conceal the destination address of monies transferred via the service. Companies \n\nThis money laundering process was even replicated on Friday. Money was again transferred from one of the recently sanctioned addresses to a third-party middleman before returning to Tornado Cash.\n\nTornado Cash has never personally communicated with any of the permitted addresses.\nBecause of the architecture of Tornado Cash, the company's operators can't ban addresses. The OFAC mandates any entity dealing with the US banking system. \n\nThe mixer has included a compliance tool from Chainalysis. It is a blockchain intelligence business that allows it to ban specific addresses. However, only on the decentralised customer software that Tornado Cash's operators have control over. Individuals can still circumvent this certification tool by using the method itself. Furthermore, the Chainalysis program only revealed the initially approved address as of the previous week.\n\"OFAC is the arbiter of what addresses have to be actually blocked,\" a Tornado Cash spokesperson initially told CoinDesk.\n\n\"So far, it's been a guessing game. It is presume OFAC has found just one address that should be basically authorised in connection with that occurrence. That is to say, Chainalysis modifies whatever is on the penalty list \"explained the spokesperson. Facing all these captivating it has become important to have cryptocurrencies that are easy to track, projects like Polygon, Point Network, Theta, etc, are good examples which can be useful for facilitating multiple transactions which are easy to track.",

Are all these counties going to be able to invalidate NFT deeds on the blockchain?  What\u2019s even the point then?\n\nHow about tickets!  We can put Ticketmaster out of business!  Except venues and artists have no incentive to move to a decentralized ticketing platform because they make more money by having a monopoly over ticket issuance by a central authority.",

The company also published a list of airdrop eligibility criteria, which range from simple things like being an Optimism user to more difficult things like being a DAO voter or multisig signer. \n\nThe token airdrop will be the first in a series of airdrops to be released in the coming months. While the team did not provide an exact date for the first airdrop, it took care to warn users that it is not live yet, and any attempt to convince users otherwise is a scam.\n\nThe token decrease is part of a bigger shift toward decentralized governance. The Optimism Collective, as it will be named after today's announcement, will have a bicameral \"house\" system with a Token House and a Citizens' House dividing governance powers. Optimism will add users to the Citizens' House later by issuing \"soulbound\" NFTs that cannot be purchased or sold, and the Token House will be made up of OP beneficiaries during the first airdrop. The bicameral system is designed to counteract the potential plutocratic inclinations of token-based governance.\n\nOptimism uses Optimistic Rollups, a type of cryptographic method, to help Ethereum scale. It can process transactions faster and at a lesser cost than Ethereum mainnet while using the network's security by running its own network on top of the base chain. \n\nThe Ethereum mainnet is connected to Optimism's Layer 2 network via a bridge. The network has welcomed significant DeFi initiatives like Synthetix and Uniswap since its introduction in 2021. Optimism will use a decentralized governance approach similar to many other DeFi initiatives on Ethereum when issuing a token. \n\nThe token announcement had been anticipated for several days, thanks mainly to an Apr. 19 Mirror post in which Optimism detailed a plan to start a new chapter \u201cdriven by community ownership and governance.\u201d\n\nThe project has witnessed tremendous growth in recent months as more attention has been paid to Ethereum's Layer 2 scaling solutions. According to L2Beat data, the network currently has $662 million in total value locked, up 15% in the previous week when the token speculations began to circulate. Notably, despite the current surge of publicity surrounding Optimism, it still trails its greatest competitor, Arbitrum, another Optimistic Rollup Layer 2 solution with $3.57 billion in total value locked\u2014more than half of the Ethereum Layer 2 market.\n\nWhile Optimism and Arbitrum are now Ethereum's two most powerful scaling weapons, this is expected to change if ZK-Rollups such as StarkWare's StarkNet acquire traction. MakerDAO, an early Ethereum DeFi project, announced plans to launch on StarkNet this Thursday, starting with a bridge launch, as part of its commitment to helping the Ethereum ecosystem scale (2022 is also a big year for the Ethereum protocol and its scaling roadmap, with the highly anticipated \"Merge\" to Proof-of-Stake set to launch). \n\nIt's not commonplace in the DeFi sector for projects to release a token after a competitor does so in order to promote usage and help bootstrap growth. In any case, the race to build out Layer 2 will certainly become a major storyline in Ethereumland in the coming months, alongside the Merge.",

            "selftext": "Transactions on Ethereum can easily [cost more than $200 in gas](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7e3744801b5b5ecf54cee34d80abd07a1f1e401f3d6abd7a9539c7b1b4ae3736). Many projects work hard to solve this problem. Some say you need alternative chains outside of Ethereum. Others say L2s are the solution, and everything needs to stay tightly connected to Ethereum.\n\nRegardless of which camp you support, the truth is that most value is still sitting on Ethereum L1, where gas is unbearable. [According to DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/chains), $113.89B is locked on Ethereum, with Terra as second and third BSC. In the [Ethereum Layer 2 space](https://l2beat.com/), Arbitrum leads the charts with $3.65B locked, followed by dYdX ($1.00B TVL) and Optimism ($686M TVL). Most interesting apps and opportunities are still on Ethereum.\n\nMany of us have deposits inside protocols on Ethereum. Sometimes, those deposits are not large, and it is economically infeasible to withdraw (gas costs more than the deposit is worth). Or we want to deposit into some smart contract that only exists on Ethereum today, but high gas prices are holding us off.\n\nA question arises: **Is there a way to save gas on Ethereum L1 today before everyone moves to L2s and alternative chains?**\n\nBatch transactions let people save up to 90% in gas on Ethereum L1. Instead of sending a costly transaction on your own, you can batch it with other people and split the gas. Let me explain how batch transactions work using the following diagram:\n\n[Single Transaction \\(left\\), Batch Transaction \\(right\\)](https://preview.redd.it/nnw0hh5r2aw81.png?width=1650&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9c1d0f954265a51b2e6cf8b5e7489eb9eda0dc3)\n\nThe left part of the diagram shows a single (non-batch) transaction which costs 1M in gas for the user.\n\nThe right part shows when multiple users join a batch transaction. Extra \u201cbatch smart contract\u201d is involved, which serves as a proxy between the users and the \u201cexpensive smart contract\u201d. In this case, funds are pulled into the batch smart contract (gas cost is only 90k) from all batch users and deposited into the \u201cexpensive smart contract\u201d as a single transaction.\n\nThe result is that in the case of batch transactions, each user only pays 363.33k in gas. This equals 69% in gas savings with just 3 batch participants. Savings increase with more people in the batch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Many people successfully batched their transactions and saved in gas using Wido Batch Transactions.**\n\nFollowing are examples of recent batch transactions and gas savings:\n\n(1) Withdraw USDC from yvCurve-stETH\n\n* Batch size: 4 users\n* Total batch transaction value (in USD): $36,265\n* Gas savings: 69.74%\n* [Link to Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf64eb05c97e6ae78a99f24aef3cd9838e4b6aeb108d44fe22d8d3fc0e2c39e06)\n\n(2) Withdraw USDC from yvUSDC 0.3.0 and deposit into yvUSDC 0.4.3 (vault migration)\n\n* Batch size: 7 users\n* Total batch transaction value (in USD): $226,905\n* Gas savings for each batch participant: 61%\n* [Link to Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf6cddab208ba1a1e06d46f238cc7745c9a70690f4afadc763fab2e16a28f4016)\n\nYou can see more recent batches and learn more about the product on the [Wido Batch Transactions](https://www.joinwido.com/wido-together) page. If you are interested in more details on how it works, [check this article](https://www.joinwido.com/blog/gasless-deposits-and-withdrawals-for-ethereum-vaults).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How much gas can batch transactions save?**\n\nBelow is a chart showing the ratio between gas savings and batch size. It was calculated for [this transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7e3744801b5b5ecf54cee34d80abd07a1f1e401f3d6abd7a9539c7b1b4ae3736) (deposit USDC into the Curve Frax vault by [yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance/) using a Zap). The numbers will differ slightly for different transactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Gas savings based on number of users in a batch](https://preview.redd.it/an77mhc93aw81.png?width=2082&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee525587073d07f0228438bc9ef676144dc1965f)\n\nAs you can see, with just three people in the batch, everyone saves 60% in gas. With 20 batch participants, the gas savings are almost 90% for each batch participant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Try Batch Transactions and save gas on Ethereum**\n\nGo to [app.joinwido.com](https://app.joinwido.com/?utm_source=widoblog&utm_medium=blog&campaign=how-to-save-90-in-gas-on-ethereum), filter vaults on Ethereum and look for gasless deposits, withdrawals or migrations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**We are looking for feedback and partnerships \u270c\ufe0f**\n\nWe are happy with the initial results and would love to take Wido batch transactions to the next level to let more people and protocols benefit from gas savings.\n\nWe are looking for:\n\n* Suggestions on which transactions do you want to be cheaper? If you are stuck in an expensive vault or plan to deposit into some vault on Ethereum L1: let us know, and we will integrate it into Wido batch transactions so that you can split the gas with others\n* Protocols interested in integrating batch transactions to let their users save in gas\n\nWe think we can extend batch transactions to pretty much any transaction on Ethereum L1, and we need your help to get there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thank you** [**yearn.finance**](https://yearn.finance)\n\nBig thanks to the yearn fam for all their help and feedback while building batch transactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Get in touch**\n\nWido is also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joinwido) and [Telegram](https://t.me/joinwido).

Amongst many things that I was able to quickly dismantle, he claims that Ethereum's smart contracts are a joke because of the difficulty bomb smart contract which was supposed to activate a long time ago, but has been delayed many times. Meaning, that someone was able to cancel/amend it. Thus, making Ethereum centralized bs. \n\nI tried to find more about it to understand the mechanics of it and if something like that is actually possible. I thought the activation of it is still a debate between the core devs and is yet to be confirmed; I believe currently planned for June. \n\nCould someone point me in the right direction or shortly explain the situation? Why would we even need the difficulty bomb now, if the PoS switch is around the corner and it will change everything?\n\nThanks :)",

The bomb is already part of node software and starts to go off in May. It will make the network unusable towards the end of July (the Ice Age of Ethereum). The question being answered by the developers tomorrow is whether or not the Merge will be ready to ship before the ~end of July deadline. I'm thinking they'll probably opt to delay the bomb, and the community will have another hard fork similar to Arrow Glacier where it simply delays the bomb again for X months. \n\nWhat happens when they delay the bomb is that they write new node software (Geth, Erigon, Besu, etc.) with the new bomb date. Then all the nodes on the network are asked to update to this new version. Nodes have the option to *not* upgrade, but realistically there's no reason to not upgrade and the Ethereum community is very much in agreement that the merge should happen when the developers are ready for it.",

That's a big difference.\n\nThis really forces the miners to abandon mining Ethereum; tbh it's quite and an aggressive strategy. I can see why this is controversial, but also understand why this has been implemented.\n\nSo if Ethereum miners would want to fork Ethereum before the PoS switch, to create \"Ethereum Carbon\" they would have to also rewrite the node software. Which makes everything more difficult.\n\nWell I can see why BTC maxis can have an impression of centralization in this case, especially when misrepresenting some of the facts. \n\nI don't hope to \"win\" my argument, and turn this guy. It seems that people that only like Bitcoin see decentralization as something that abandons any form of organized cooperation. Whilst I see it as a spectrum, where Ethereum doesn't have a person or a defined group of people making decisions, however it allows anyone to contribute, participate and collaborate. Whilst also ensuring decentralization by the preserving the ability of nodes to fork at anytime if sufficient number of them decides to do so.\n\nWould you agree? Add anything to that?",

This is ofc played down by BTC maxis, but most people do not understand the true problem which is economic:\n\nThe waste (mostly power consumption, but also hardware) created by miners is proportional to the economic incentive for miners (currently 6.25 BTC per 10 minutes). That again is proportional to Bitcoin price. \n\nLet that sink in. Bitcoin's power consumption is proportional to BTC price!\n\nSo everyone argues that power consumption of the network is ok should be asked: do you think BTC will increase in price? And if they say yes, 10x or 100x then you should aks what about 10x or 100x the current power consumption?\n\nAlso, do not believe the \"we use 100% renewable energy\" - the miners compete worldwide, no one can control what type of power they use. There will always be countries that do not enforce such rules, especially if it's profitable.\n\n\"we only use excess power\" or \"BTC helps stabilize the grid\" are also nonsense. Mining equipment is priced to run 24/7 and there is really no excess energy production - BTC miners are crowding out others or increasing energy (and hardware) prices.\n\nIn short: if BTC becomes as successful as the BTC maxis hope, climate change will definitely kill us. We are talking about a potentially double digit percentage of extra worldwide power production needed compared to proof of stake.\n\nB) Bitcoin's governance is the second problem. They could never fix the first problem, because that would require ALL miners to vote for their own ruin as they could throw away their hardware investments which are good foor NOTHING except Bitcoin Mining if Bitcoin switches to PoS. I am no prophet, but that is not going to happen. Ever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my best guess is that BTC maxis will do their thing and lobby like hell to protect their profits and habits, until at some point - hopefully - the public gets what the massive threat this system poses and will then regulate it into oblivion.",

It\u2019s more for the middle aged crowd who have busy lives and just want a small understanding, as we are a young community.  Regardless, feel free to check it out or leave a comment!\n\nIn the future I hope to put out a video a week but in the short term it probably won\u2019t be quite that quick as I figure out how to streamline the creation process a bit.

It comes with built-in accounts with thousands of ETH so it's easy to spin up a new chain to test contracts.\n\nIf your contract needs other tokens like USDC or DAI or whatever, you can deploy those as well by copying the contracts to your local test chain or you can deploy on a public testnet like Goerli where those tokens already exist.",

In the UK for example it's bizarrely common for people to [lose their home due to ID theft](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-59069662), because essentially all someone needs to do is alter the land registry (a central database of property ownership) and voila, the property is theirs. At least with an NFT someone needs to actually gain access to some sort of wallet in order to move it, with most modern registry systems they basically just need to impersonate the owner and adopt their ID. Obviously if you do get hacked, there needs to be a central body (like HM land registry) who can render that NFT worthless and issue you a new one. This is already possible with stablecoins, so it isn't unreasonable to suggest it be implemented for NFTs of this sort.\n\nAs for the liquidity argument, it's honestly an absolutely shite take to try to claim that illiquidity in the property market is somehow a good thing. It isn't, and shame on you for even suggesting so tbh.\n\n>what advantage does blockchain offer for airline tickets? Would wouldn't the airlines just continue to operate a simpler server that is drastically more efficient and controllable.\n\nDo you have any idea how complicated airline ticket pricing is? It's honestly byzantine and not remotely efficient. It's all controlled by an algorithm that tries to adapt to supply and demand, but y'know what else does that? The market. Obviously airlines go out of their way to make it impossible to resell airline tickets, but that's so they can charge you a fee if your plans change. Imagine though that your ticket is an NFT you can sell, but every time someone buys or sells the ticket the airline gets a kickback. They can still set minimum pricing, but now they get to offload the entire process of booking changes to the blockchain and just rake in the cash. Meanwhile passengers don't have to fight about changing their plans, because they can just sell tickets they don't need anymore and buy the ones they do want on the open market.",

Just like we wear Supreme clothes or Gucci belts to show off our personality the same can be said for digital personas.\n\nAs more and more platforms and games (I'm avoiding the word metaverse because its a trendy word that's over used) start allowing the integration of NFTs you can understand the importance of digital identities on these platforms.\n\nNFTs allow the owners to take that identity to MULTIPLE diff platforms. \n\nYou can jump into World of Warcraft to play with your group of friends and equip your Nike sneakers in game as a skin. Later that night you can jump into VRChat to meet up with another crew. Your VR avatar can have those same Nike Sneakers equipped. Play some call of duty? Because you own this specific NFT you get a limited edition Nike P90 skin.\n\nNike can also now run targeted deals, specials, free shit, events etc. All requiring the ownership of this NFT. So can anyone. This isn't a Nike specific App that only Nike controls. Nike partners or other companies can verify your ownership of this and provide some sort of deal/value/experience.\n\nThose are just some examples.

Not only is Optimism leading the way for Optimistic rollups, they are on the forefront of innovating governance techniques, funding mechanisms, community involvement etc.\n\nIf all of the systems they're experimenting with work, they could have a massive influence on how the rest of the future economic system is built so that it works for everyone and not just small groups of investors.  We should all be thankful for groups like Optimism that are paving the way and teaching the rest of the community about how we could build systems that don't just rehash old incentive structures.\n\nSuccess for Optimism means success for all of us that are here now and all of those that come after us.  If you haven't dabbled in the Optimism network, or read about their design philosophies, I highly recommend  bridging funds to play with their network and listening/watching some of the podcast and lectures Karl Floersch has done where he talks about Retroactive Public Goods funding, and other ideas their team has been playing with.\n\nIncredibly excited about their future, and the future of all Ethereans.",

If you simply hold ETH and it goes up 10% you make 10%. \n\nNow imagine borrowing a stablecoin = 1$ against your ETH, trading for ETH and borrowing until you have 2x your ETH and your original value worth of ETH in stablecoin debt. If ETH goes up 10% you now make 20% instead of 10%. Conversely if it drops your losses will be larger and may even lead to absolute loss if you get liquidated.\n\n## Negative exposure\n\nBorrowing also gives you negative exposure. If you have stablecoins and borrow ETH against it and sell it for more stablecoins you'll make money if the value of ETH decreases. You can also do ETH vs WBTC shorts/longs this way.\n\n## Avoid selling & realizing gains\n\nLet's say you bought ETH way back and you're now up 20x. Instead of selling and incurring taxes for those gains you can borrow against it and spend the loan, tax free, under most jurisdictions (consult a CPA).\n\nWhile the loan is open you also continue to be exposed to the price of ETH. If you sold instead of borrowing you'd be reducing your exposure to the underlying asset.\n\n## Yield Farming\n\nSome lending protocols such as Aave, Compound and more will give you tokens for borrowing. Sometimes the value of the so-called \"liquidity mining rewards\" will be more than the interest you're paying on the loan. Additionally you'll be earning yield on your collateral and can likely earn further interest on the borrowed assets which can result in a nice total APY.\n\nThese days it's likely not recommendable to do this manually as many platforms aka \"yield aggregators\" automate and optimize these strategies on your behalf.\n\n## APY arbitrage\n\nIf the borrow rate on one platform is lower than the supply rate on another, you can borrow on the one and lend to the other for a net profit. \n\n\nHope that helps! There's probably other use cases for over collateralized borrowing but I can't think of them rn.",

Plus I don't have to worry about my gov suddenly deciding I'm a bad guy and telling an exchange to freeze all of my assets like happened to the Canadians, politics aside being treated like a criminal without due process is dystopian as fuck.\n\nI take loans if I want to make a large purchase that I would like to have a low interest on, so for example a bike, 2.76% is a lot better than the 6-8% I can get from my bank for a motorcycle loan, and I don't have to sell my crypto and pay tax on it to do that, which also means I'm able to keep my investment, usually returning more than 2.76%.\n\nSometimes I will use it when I see opportunity, if the market is down a lot and I feel confident it will rise again I might take a loan and buy some alts while they're down and sell them when the market bumps back up, I do it pretty rarely as it's not always clear to me that the market will recover, but I've made gains doing this despite the down trend the markets been in since the last ATH so it's nice to have that liquidity when there are obvious bargains.\n\nAside from all of that, by actually using crypto I'm supporting the ecosystem which increases the value of my long term investment in the technology I want to see replace centralised and corrupt existing systems.",

[Quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting) and its variants help to dampen the problems as much as possible, while still trying to retain the \"being in early/long\" positives stated before, but it's still present.\n\n**B) ERC721 NFT token voting**\n\nThis is a variant of (A) but uses NFTs instead. Depending on how you want to mint these NFTs, they can be used as a way to verify that someone's a person (see [ProofOfHumanity](https://app.proofofhumanity.id/)), or as a participation reward (see [POAPs](https://poap.xyz/)), or for something else entirely. \n\nDepending on the types of token holders you want as part of the people voting in your DAO, this may be desirable. However, the same problems from (A) still arise if a person accumulates more NFTs than others.\n\n**C) (A) or (B), but (one address, one vote OR minimum token, one vote OR quadratic voting OR <insert custom mechanism here> )**\n\nThis is just a catch-all for anything else outside of the first 2, and for any governance systems built on top of (A)/(B). The aforementioned quadratic voting mechanism applies here. Again, depending on the outcomes you want, there's no problem in bolting on additional guards & checks to existing voting systems. [Snapshot alone allows for FPTP, Approval, Quadratic, Ranked-choice, & Weighted voting.](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types) \n\nMore variants exist outside of Snapshot (e.g. one address one vote, but coins/NFTs must be locked up until voting's over), and there's no end as to what can be mixed & matched for the voting outcomes you want.\n\n\n____\n\nThis isn't an exhaustive list, & other variants may exist outside of these 3.",

Since Ethereum is the blockchain on which the majority of NFTs are created it's the one I have the most trust.   \n\n\nAs you figured it out, I'm planning to mint NFTs on Ethereum, I'm currently learning about the whole process so I will write here to you what I've found out, and pls correct me if I'm wrong, cause I want to know everything step by step.   \n\n\nAs we all know ETH, is also the name of the network's native currency. So, when you sell and acquire NFTs, you're almost certainly going to utilize Ethereum.  \n\n\nFor buying and selling NFTs, you'll usually use an NFT marketplace, which is similar to eBay or Amazon for NFTs, something like SK8coin if you're into unique street art marketplaces or if you're into general then you'll find the one that suits you the most.    \n\n\nYou'll need ETH to manage further payments and purchases. Yup, ETH is really important, I figured that out.  \n\n\nI found this [link](https://101blockchains.com/nft-minting/) where is written step by step, do you have any additional advice for me?  \n\n[Maybe some of you will find this helpful](https://preview.redd.it/1ti80pn7dvv81.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b5b1c9ae627ed7c768f1000f7dff4843c8b69d0)",

A few people here have already hit the nail on the head. The two main things for me are being part of a community and producing supplementary income. I have a discord server where NFT artists and collectors can both get updates on my projects and share what they are creating/trading with each other. The artists share their techniques with each other and support each others' work by purchasing  what they like from each other. I have set up a community wallet where a certain percentage of my profits gets transferred to and then the community votes on what new artists to invest in. I am not making life changing money, this is just something I enjoy doing and other people enjoy supporting my art as well.\n\nArtists have always had trouble selling their work and NFTs seem to be something people have latched onto to finally begin to support artists. I think it all ties into social media as well. Now you have an easily viewable paper trail of your support for an artist. \n\nDon't get me wrong though, it is the wild west out there right now and there are a lot of ABSOLUTE TRASH projects going for stupid amounts of money with zero utility. But think of it this way, people will pay $10-$100 for little statues or figurines to put on their window sills or decorate their homes with and they essentially have no utility and people know that these trinkets are just mass produced in a Chinese factory but buy them anyway. With NFT art you can directly communicate with the artist on discord/Twitter whatever, purchase their art and possibly have utility with that art, whether it's a guarantee that a certain percentage goes to charity, gets reinvested back into the art community, or even can be staked using smart contracts and have a Dao distribute yield to holders. \n\nSorry this is a run on.",

I guess that's partly a community thing, but mostly a more fun and easy way to donate and express support.\n\nNFT's can also be utilized as tickets, like the GET protocol (and, in case you're worried about transaction costs, this is perfectly suitable to run on an L2 or sidechain).\n\nOf course many NFT's will be rubbish, just like most souvenirs people buy on a holiday.",

Then, the case is sent out to a randomly-selected jury to vote on. The majority vote decides the outcome and which party gets paid. If you disagree with the outcome, you can fund an appeal to trigger a second round which involves an even larger number of jurors.\n\nJurors are incentivized to tell the truth since if they vote with the majority they earn ETH, but if they vote against it they lose their staked tokens. Since they expect the majority to vote for the truth, that's how they are incentivized to vote as well. It's a concept in game theory called a Schelling point. Or at least, that's my understanding it - the [whitepaper](https://kleros.io/whitepaper.pdf)/[yellowpaper](https://kleros.io/yellowpaper.pdf) could explain it a lot better.\n\nIt's also [endorsed by Vitalik](https://twitter.com/Kleros_io/status/1473632145256165378) if you need further convincing.",

Their definition of scam is going to be a moving goalpost. So, if ETH had a better distribution than BTC is BTC a scam? If ETH had more independent actors at its consensus layer is BTC a scam?\n\nAt what point would ETH not be a scam? I hear a lot of \"70% premine scam\" comments but the Ethereum foundation has 0.3% of the total supply. I hear Vitalik rug the chain anytime but he has like .1% of the total supply. I hear PoS is a scam, but PoW has economy of scale advantages to large farmers that PoS does not. If what we want is for a large group of anonymous actors to reach consensus on state, Ethereum is doing that as advertised. It's doing it in a sustainable way. That's *all* it does. You have to go through some mental gymnastics to call something that is doing an honest task, in a sustainable way, as it has been advertised, a scam.",

Therefor its is not a fair distribution\n\n \\-there is not fix supply, being inflationary or deflationary ( also brings a set of issues)\n\n\\- and there is the move to a POS model that will more than likely further centralize the network.\n\nThese are the main reason I decided to quit ETH and become a BTC maxi. I don't think ETH is a scam (there are many scams in this space), but I think that the compromise that the network makes in order to achieve the product they want to offer does not match what I want to invest in.\n\nI think the kneejerk reaction that most BTC maxi have in regard to all other crypto is one of laziness. Either too lazy to analyze the other offers in the space or too lazy to explain the reasons why they would rather stick to BTC instead of other offers.\n\nIt is a natural reaction for human to use a default responses to similar problems, this is how we save energy. If you see 100 cryptos and 99% are scams, it require less cognitive power to say they are all scams.",

If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.\n\n**When is Eth2 launching?**\n\nEth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. \"The Merge\", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.\n\nVisit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about \"The Merge\".\n\n**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**\n\nNo, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.\n\n**How can I stake my ETH?**\n\nThere are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.\n\n* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details\n* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)\n\n**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**\n\nLike most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.\n\n**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**\n\nEthereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.\n\nAdditionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.\n\nWhile rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.\n\n**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**\n\nThe most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre there questions you'd like to see added? Leave a comment below.",

And the honest nodes would refuse the unwanted update (or continue to run the honest version of the software by default if everything evil is happening in the dark) and it'd be trivial to say \"sorry Vitalik but x% of the nodes are running the version of the chain where you didn't print yourself 100k ETH, so we're just gonna sync to their fork instead of yours\" and then Vitalik is left holding 100k worthless ETH on a worthless fork.",

If the period passes and no one challenges it, **your submission is added to the registry**. If it is challenged, then a dispute is opened in a Kleros court where jurors are incentivized to vote coherently. You can appeal if you disagree with the result of a round by putting a deposit. If you lose, the deposit goes to the challenger.\n\nThe list is created in a **permissionless manner**, the submissions and rules are **transparent** to all. It evens the playing field for projects of all sizes. Also credibly neutral.\n\nSince it's something that we all can use and build upon, it's a public good. And we know [public goods are good](https://twitter.com/notscottmoore/status/1516765436142043142?s=20&t=mZqiPaL8IiD6O797dKhZvg).\n\n**How can we move towards that? \ud83d\udca1**  \nBy building a [decentralized address tag registry](https://blog.kleros.io/the-kleros-decentralized-tag-registry-a-proof-of-concept-for-securing-web3/) for block explorers and wallets. It can help answer some of these questions:\n\n* Does this contract belong to the protocol I\u2019m trying to interact with?\n* Am I sending tokens to the right address?\n* Why does this contract holds so many of these tokens?\n* Should I authorize this transaction?\n\nWe already have a few submissions, and the policy rules went through their first revision. There\u2019s a block explorer out there that already uses it. \ud83d\udc40\n\nThere's instructions on how to submit [here](https://blog.kleros.io/the-kleros-decentralized-tag-registry-a-proof-of-concept-for-securing-web3/). People can add it to their starting kit when launching a project.\n\nBut this is just the start. We need more block explorers and wallets to use it, we need more adoption. If you are engaged with the development of a wallet or service that might want to use it, let them know this registry exists.  \n**\ud83e\udd11 So what about the earning part?**\n\nKleros is committing 100 000 PNK every month to users that participate on this initiative. Rewards are shared according to the fees spent by each contract, to ensure the most used ones are tagged first.\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot to tag, a lot to integrate with!",

It protects you from outside attacks and most importantly it protects you from yourself. I think it's insane to store your private keys on any device that wasn't built to wall your keys off. Especially if the keys access accounts that contain value too painful to lose.   \n\n\nI see no downside in hardware wallets. Transaction confirmation is a feature not a bug.

            "selftext": " I just finished a 2 hour readthrough of Nic Carter's & Linda Jeng's 'DeFi Protocol Risks: The Paradox of DeFi' for the Ethereum Audible Podcast. They point out 5 key risks - which have all come true over the past year.\n\nHere's a brief summary of the 36 page article and 5 risks.\n\nDeFi is growing and is quickly on its way to becoming a new financial paradigm. But...there are financial risks in DeFi that manifest in new ways that we haven\u2019t seen in the traditional financial system. The 5 risks pointed out are:\n\n1. Interconnections with the traditional financial system\n2. Operational risks stemming from underlying blockchains\n3. Smart contract-based vulnerabilities\n4. Other governance and regulatory risks\n5. Scalability challenges.\n\nLet's look at each.\n\n1. **Interconnections with the traditional financial system:**\n\nStablecoins are the main connection to the existing financial system. They're pegged to fiat, but also via custodian banks. Stablecoins are one of the killer apps for crypto, but offer a centralization risk. Lyn Alden covers stablecoin centralization risk in her article: \"Proof-of-Stake and Stablecoins: A Blockchain Centralization Dilemma\" (did a readthrough of that a few weeks ago: [https://open.spotify.com/episode/3cTMt0friaFdmWwJvbDtmX?si=2MYAbps7Ra-fq50oEbCmUg](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3cTMt0friaFdmWwJvbDtmX?si=2MYAbps7Ra-fq50oEbCmUg))\n\n2. **Operational risks stemming from underlying blockchains**\n\nConsensus failures (aka what happened to [SOL](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SOL) recently), protocol changes, changing security assurances (PoW or PoS) all can be risk vectors for any protocol built on top.\n\n3. **Smart contract-based vulnerabilities**\n\nAll the bugs you can imagine that allow draining of funds. Most famous of which - the DAO hack, but also most recently the Wormhole hack. Oracle attacks also are a vulnerability vector ([https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22916111/wormhole-hack-github-error-325-million-theft-ethereum-solana](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22916111/wormhole-hack-github-error-325-million-theft-ethereum-solana))\n\n4. **Other governance and regulatory risks**\n\nThese risks include bad regulation or multi sig management - aka Axie's Ronin hack. Flash loans can be used to sway governance as well - a new risk unique to DeFi, aka the Beanstalk attack last week.\n\n5. **Scalability challenges**\n\nInelastic block space can lead to high fees, irregular execution or transactions that don't go through at all - which lead to unexpected edge cases.\n\nTo bring it all together, DeFi is developing super fast, bringing more innovation to the financial world than any time since the 1800s. But it comes with new sets of risk. We're in heading west, as they like to say on Bankless!\n\nFor the full readthrough (\\~2 hours) you can give it a listen on [@EthereumAudible](https://twitter.com/EthereumAudible) podcast or read the entire paper here: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=3866699](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3866699).\n\nEnjoy!",

I run a micro-business w/3 remote employees. We draft professional reports for building contractors who work with insurance companies ($125 per report).\n\nAfter the merge, I will migrate the business to Web3. My ENS will facilitate the following:\n\n* Integrate DNS w/ENS to decentralize the customer-facing site.\n* ENS monitizes my site for direct customer payments.\n* Will issue subdomains to my 3 employees. This will be the first stage in offering them fractional ownership.\n* Will integrate Ethereum dapp with ENS for push notifications, end-2-end encrypted email, IPFS file storage, manage worker output, & maintain everything as Ethereum native as possible.\n* Will integrate smart contracts with ENS. This is where the real magic starts. SC w/ENS enable me to convert my business into a nested network; on-chain.\n* SC: Immediate payment to employees when they finish an assignment. No waiting a week. SC manages invoices,\n* SC: Allow me to let employees collaborate amongst each other to build customer services. The SC ensures I receive a portion of any value they generate.\n* SC work with IPFS to ensure proper sorting/management of documents.\n* My solidity guy says he can add a SC wrap to ensure proper set-aside for taxes.\n* This enables us to take on more business with fewer producers.\n* Subdomains + dapps + smart contracts underpin the operation's integrity.\n* I plan to monetize the accruing value & distribute it to workers. I want them to carry a financial interest in the growth of the business.\n* Ideally, over the long-term, I want everything to be run on-chain. This way, I can sell it with a smart contract and ensure perpetual royalties.\n\nEthereum is a combined network, marketplace, and platform. ENS will be the first project to fully expand on ERC721's design potential. And that's just the start. Those are the best $40 you may spend in crypto.",

So 25 distinct pairs of clients ran the merge against mainnet (simulating very closely what the real thing will look like) and all came to consensus on a point in time where PoW ended and PoS started.\n\nThere is very concrete progress being done, but there's still more testing to do and more shadow forks to come. Next friday the devs will get on a call and there's a good chance we get an idea of what the final timeline will look like as far as public testnet merges go, and onto the true mainnet merge.",

It can be more subtly gamed by other miners with lots of hashpower, because they could pretend they didn't see that block 101 and instead mine their own block 101.\n\nGaming it this way has a cost to the miner, as withholding a block to avoid losing a bet loses them the block reward and fees. So in theory you're OK as long as the amount as stake in gameable bets is less than than the block reward and fees. However there is no way for you to know either of these numbers in advance: Fees vary from block to block, and you have no idea who *else* has used the block hash in the same way as you, and how much there is at stake on it.\n\nThe timestamp can be trivially gamed by the miner at no cost, they can just pick any number between the time the last block was mined and the time the current block is mined. So block hash is less bad than block timestamp, although they're both bad.\n\nNote that PoS brings in a whole new set of considerations, the plan is to replace the *difficulty* field with a somewhat bias-able random number.",

Letting people mass transfer money out of the system harms them when the value of their currency literally controls how many resources and arms they can aquire. They aren't just getting free support, they are getting deals to pay for it too.\n\nAnother thing that crypto enthusiasts seem clueless about: **a healthy currency should have a small rate of inflation**. You want it to devalue a little bit over time, because it encourages people to spend money and invest, which in turn grows the economy. \n\nObviously you can't have hyper-inflation, but when the value of the Ukranian dollar drops further and further, becuase of people transferring it to crypto or other currnencies -- **that is going to encourage excess money printing**.\n\n> they'll save their central bank \n\nWhere do you think the majority of their citizens have their money? In banks and cash. They are protecting the interest of their citizens too -- especially considering they are in the midst of a war on their own soil!",

I know that the aggregate amount of fees that Ethereum collects from L2s is like \\~1% of Ethereum's total fees, so not significant.\n\nIf Ethereum's growth plans revolve around L2s and other scaling solutions like Polygon, then it seems very important to understand the value capture of this growth by Ethereum. If these solutions offer say 1/100th of fees, then doesn't that mean overall demand on these solutions needs to 100x in order to have the same order of effect if that demand were to take place on Ethereum L1?",

I'd be happy if it was just for one of the biggies. I know that I can tinker on testnets for free, but I'd like the skin-in-the-game feel of real money, and _why not_?\n\nI recall that e.g. Coinbase would let you buy Polygon MATIC _tokens_, but as far as I understand, these tokens (while great in many ways) are still on L1.... Or are they. It's all quite confusing.\n\nI have enough ethereum to do this using any of the bridges, but if my goal is to have ~$10 of Polygon (or something) to play with, the fees for doing the L1->L2 are absurd for that amount of money (to say nothing of L2->L1, which maybe is considered optional these days.) At least, that was the case last I checked mere months ago.\n\nI've been an Ethereum hodler, fan and tinkerer for 7 years or so. I'm quite comfortable on L1.

Transaction costs for all rollups will keep growing.\n\nZK tech, on the other hand, enables truly infinite scalability via validiums. They come with certain security tradeoffs (and we spend a lot of effort on mitigating them with strong decentralisation), but this is the only technology we have today that can create a practical Internet of Value for millions of parallel users.\"\n\nCould someone ELI5 this? Is this saying that optimistic rollups are limited because they have to compress tx details in call data? And because there is limited space in call data, and limited/expensive space in blocks, you can't scale efficiently?\n\nLink to the AMA: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u1dyqj/comment/i4ffz0t/",

You need to bridge your assets across from L1 to L2, but the main L2s (Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, StarkNet) just use ether for gas fees, and don't yet have a token that you need to buy.\n\n\n\n> My question is: Do you think I\u2019m the future interacting with a dapp on a layer 2 will be as easy as a push of the button?\n\nThis is already kind of a thing with zkSync running through the Argent wallet, at least as far as swapping tokens around.\n\nFor Arbitrum and Optimism, once you've bridged across the dApps work exactly as they do on L1, just faster and much cheaper. Almost all of the same DeFi platforms are available already, so if you know how to use Curve, AAVE, Balancer, Sushi, Uni, Synthetix etc on Ethereum then you also know how to use them on L2s.\n\nI don't think we'll ever get to a stage like in your scenario where the user doesn't choose stuff manually, because if I've got assets on L1 and multiple L2s I don't want the dApp deciding which of those to use... you'll always have to connect your chosen wallet (think of the security risk if this wasn't the case)... and in the specific example of RocketPool I don't quite see how that could run on an L2, because it's entire purpose is to pool ether for validators on the Beacon Chain. You can buy rETH on rollups, but the dApp itself probably will only work on L1?\n\nYou're asking good questions though. If you haven't tried using rollups yet it's worth giving it a go. In the future basically all normal users will be transacting on L2s, so it makes sense to learn as much about them whenever you can.",

I don't have any insider knowledge about Loopring, but I do have info about other ZK projects, and there's _lots_ of corners being cut across the industry just to get something working out the door.\n\nAnd most things marketed as \"zkEVMs\" aren't actually EVMs, they're just marketing it that way. The ZKSync team even addressed this discrepancy in their talk in Amsterdam yesterday.\n\nAFAIK, Hermez and Loopring are the only teams that have expressed that they'd make a full opcode-compatible zkEVM. While it will be great if they can pull it off, doing an EVM-equivalent ZK circut is extremely difficult, more-so than a normal general-purpose ZK rollup.\n\nFurthermore, Loopring has never been the leader in ZK tech, they even considered switching to StarkWare's tech at one point. So given how hard it has been for the leading projects to advance, I'm very skeptical that Loopring will even be able to keep-up.",

What is the right avenue to ask?\n\n---\n\n`go` has the concept of goroutines, which are like \"light threads\" that share context with the calling thread (and sibling goroutines). \n\n`geth` has two operating nodes, fullnode and les (Light Ethereum Subprotocol); fullnode can further run in \"full\" mode and in \"archival\" mode (which doesn't change much for this writeup).\n\n1. in the full mode, a global `server` object is created, that handles p2p networking\n2. the `server` makes great use of channels and goroutines. goroutines run concurrently, but concurrency does not imply parallelism. Since go version 1.5, goroutines *can* run in parallel, tho, so that's nice. \n3. the `server` makes a thread in `listenLoop()` for accepting peer connections. The `server` maintains a map of connected `Peers` and creates a goroutine for each (`run()` in `p2p/peer.go`). \n4. since goroutines are cheap, they are used liberally; for example a Peer will create one for receiving messages, one for ping, etc.\n4. each peer routine will await network messages; if an incoming message is of \"network-level\" variety (handshakes, version negotiation, disconnects, ...) then it will be processed here; otherwise of it of \"application-level\" variety, it will be passed to a `protocol`\n5. a `protocol` is a map that connects each message type to a handler function; for example the `eth66` protocol handles the `66` version of `eth` messages. \n6. there is no message queue towards the protocol, instead there is a channel; it's generally a similar concept with different caveats - goroutines cannot enque items into it, but will block until their message is ready to be processed; if multiple messages are ready, one will be chosen *at random*\n7. If the message is a transaction, it will indeed be enqueued for processing in the mempool, otherwise if it's a block, it will be processed right away\n\n---\n\nThe `les` mode is radically different and it's evident that it was implemented in a separate time with different architecture. It maintains a complex task queue, in which tasks are prioritized, and can be put on hold if higher priority tasks come in. Each peer is given a `buffer` (or an \"allowance\") with a `recharge rate`, and messages from the peers with most `buffer` are processed first. Peers consume their `buffer` proportionally to the computational complexity of the messages they send. This ensures that peers cannot DoS us easily. There are several task processors that read the task queue, but if a task processor is idle, a task will be passed onto it without passing through the queue (cool optimization).",

In web2 if Facebook rolls out a new feature we can either adopt it or leave the platform, we don't have any other choice. That gives them tremendous power as they can keep binding us to use their platform. That is of course what we also want to get rid of with DeFi. If they can't do that we'd rather use the platform. But with completely immutable contracts we always need to coordinate participants toward the new implementation. And if no liquidity is on there for example people have little incentives to move. So the network effects work against us there in a way. What IS under the control of token holders that they can use to coordinate people towards using a new version? The front-ends are probably a way to guide people towards using a new implementation right? They are not really under tokens holder control though. What else is there?",

If you have upgradeable smart-contracts then you give the team god mode so they can run away with the money if they want. If you give a dao control of the upgradeability then you risk attackers being made aware of the vulnerability before the dao can gather enough votes to upgrade the contract. \n\nI think Zksync's solution is the best since they have spread the keys out across a wide spread of industry leaders so collusion is very unlikely unless there is a real threat and they can upgrade the contract with a delay without involving the other key holders so you aren't nagging them unless it is absolutely necessary.\n\nHere is an article they wrote about it\n\nhttps://blog.matter-labs.io/security-council-2-0-2337a555f17a",

It sets a huge expectation, that isn't really possible anytime soon, isn't likey to succeed and probably isn't really wanted by the community (though they might not know this yet). It locks people into this mono vision of what does and doesn't constitute a MV. Where the reality is that the concept and needs will evolve massively in a way we can't really predict. It's much more likely to be 10000s of worlds that have some interconnectivity and shared functionality, rather than a single disneyfied verse.",

Vitalik was certainly the main driver of the early concepts leaning on many astute technical advisors. If it had been possible, Ethereum would have launched as a PoS chain. At the time, a decentralized PoS was only an idea and had never been implemented. Proof-of-Work was well tested and proven by Bitcoin and simple to implement. Launching with PoW would allow the Ethereum Virtual Machine to start proving its use while PoS was developed. It was originally thought the PoS switch would happen 8-12months after launch, but it became much more difficult than first thought and has been in development ever since.",

That proposal goes through a process in which ultimately the devs at some point vote whether or not include it in the protocol. There are several proposals approved and under development that aim to move to PoS, some of them were written and voted by Vitalik, but also by the majority of devs.\n\nThen we have a second part, where the changes are released to the public, through a new version release of the protocol. At that point, all the nodes are required to update to the new version, but is up to the every node whether or not they update. It could be a possible scenario that at some point a new version with PoS is released (Eth v2) and some node just refuse to update, and they can even start a separated development (hard fork) which is exactly what happened with Eth Classic (ETC), where the devs decided something that some part of the network didn't agreed, and some nodes didn't update their releases.\n\nSo... it's a mix, the EIP can be written by anybody, the devs vote to implement it, and every single node decides to update or not.",

I hope I can post this here, I posted on r/ethdev too but I think r/ethereum is more active.\n\n- When sending eth to an address that calls a function is this the right way to do it? :\n\n\n    (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: amt}(\"\");\n\n\n    require(success);\n\nI just don't understand where the actual \"send\" is happening. Like I get it's making a call to the sender's address but when is it actually sending the value?\n\n\n- How do fallback functions work? I'm trying to learn about reentrancy attacks and was a bit confused. Is the point that when a contract calls another's withdraw function it immediately goes to the fallback function once the eth is withdrawn?\n\n\n- I'm trying to understand the concept of tx.origin. For example if i have Contract A and Contract B. If I as a user call a function through etherscan or remix or something on Contract A that calls some function in B that is to return the tx.origin, does that mean B will return my user address? Sorry if that's a little unclear, please let me know if I need to clarify\n\n\n- Along with the above question - can using tx.origin instead of msg.sender open a contract to a reentrancy style attack? I figure if contract B were to store some data it uses for comparison or a require and accesses it using tx.origin - an intermediary contract A could be used to drain the funds since you're not using msg.sender's data - rather the user's data who called the malicious contract.\n\n\nI really appreciate any help anyone can give me. I'm kind of struggling with these concepts - particularly the security related things. Apologies for the subpar formatting.",

The majority of the APY on it is also paid in BAL, not more rETH or ETH. \n\nIn real terms, you're getting decent BAL rewards (7.8-19.5%) but you're only getting ~2.14% APR in ETH/rETH including trading fees. If BAL does well and you have enough in the pool to make it worth compounding, this is great! But if BAL doesn't do very well and you're not working with enough to compensate for mainnet gas fees, this isn't really worth it. \n\nCompare that to the rETH-wstETH pool where both assets are yield-bearing derivatives and you get a base ~4% APR from staking. Then you also get ~.03% from trading fees, and if you stake the LP token in Convex you can get another 5-10% paid in CRV and CVX once the rewards from Tetranode's gauge vote resume soon. \n\nThe other decent opportunity I know of is Alchemix's Rocket rETH vault, which lets you deposit rETH and mint alETH which can be redeemed for ETH and then you can use that ETH for whatever you want. The loan is then paid off through the staking APR.",

Miners have some degree of sway because hashpower is important for security and a fork with more security will generally win out with the community assuming everything else is equal, but this isn't particularly relevant when the proposal in question is to do away with the need for hashpower entirely like it is with the Merge. \n\nEthereum has something called the [Difficulty Bomb](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-ethereums-difficulty-bomb/) in place on the network. Basically, at a certain point in the future the node clients running the network will begin to gradually increase block difficulty until the chain slows to a halt and miners can no longer create blocks. This forces node operators to upgrade to new software versions or to create their own Ethereum fork with the bomb removed. It is designed to make it less appealing to force a contentious fork around the Merge because miners would need to get the node operator community to adopt a bomb-less fork instead of being able to just continue mining on current software. Given the fact that the Ethereum community has been set on moving to PoS since day 0 of Ethereum, it seems unlikely that miners would be able to garner significant support for such a fork. I haven't even heard of any mining group trying to develop a fork like that. \n\nThe bomb has generally been delayed with each network hard fork in the past, most recently the Arrow Glacier update which *only* delayed the bomb and had no other updates. The bomb is currently set to start in May sometime, gradually increasing difficulty until the network becomes nigh-unusable with block times approaching 20 seconds at the end of July. The node client developers are currently assessing the readiness level of the Merge code to determine whether they can ship the merge in July before the bomb or if they need to delay the bomb again by a certain amount of time; the decision will be made on the 29th all-core-devs call. \n\nhttps://github.com/timbeiko/eth-roadmap-faq#merge-timelines\n\nSo, at a certain total level of block difficulty the merge will activate and consensus will switch from miners to validators. Miners will stop receiving rewards for blocks and they'll be left with the choice to either move to another chain or sell off their equipment.",

To prevent these sorts of issue you need to gate voting power based on the block that the gov proposal is put in at, and then absolutely make sure that no new gov tokens emitted or minted can influence previously submitted proposals.

These bridges are made by the rollup team usually and are the only entity with permission to mint bridged ETH on the rollup. \n\n3rd party bridges and exchanges use external systems to move assets around that have already been bridged through the canonical rollup bridge. \n\nFor example, this is the portal to use the canonical Arbitrum bridge: https://bridge.arbitrum.io/",

Simply put, platform that integrates aspects necessary for a DAO to live:\n\n* Voting (Snapshot)\n* Community communication (discord/telegram)\n* Feed (twitter/reddit)\n\n...and so on, all in one place for multiple DAOs. I can see a developer participating and/or interested in different DAOs which wants these aspects accessible all in one place.\n\nI know [DAOHaus](https://daohaus.club/) but are there any different projects on more advanced stage already? I'm also curious of your thoughts, is such social media for DAOs something you feel a need for, or is current state (being split on different centralised platforms depending on the use case) ok for you?",

As long as the concert chooses to let you in, or the law chooses to recognize your property then you are all set. The only real difference is that these two examples require one centralized entity (concert venue, and government) to recognize it. NFTs have the option for multiple entities to recognize them without any difficulty. Additionally, they can be used and traded with decentralized programming (smart contracts). \n\nThese technical differences might seem small but they have created an entire new concept of ownership. We're seeing mass experimentation with this and while the results are sometimes bad (eg buying/selling tweets), we've also seen a ton of successful concepts (online communities based around collectibles). It's just getting started.",

But everyone will know that dollar bill isn't the real deal, because it doesn't have all the security features of the real dollar bill (etching, hollographs, paper texture, etc) - so your fake dollar bill is worth nothing.\n\nThe same goes for NFT art. Your jpeg doesn't have the same features and inherent value as the real NFT you bought. \n\nMore technical: when you remint your screenshotted jpeg, the mint address will be different from the main NFT art collections mint address. It is very easy to compare the two and find yours is not part of the actual NFT collection. \n\nMore philosophical: at the end of the day, NFT art* and paper currency are all valuable because we agree they are valuable and there is a perceived want to have more of each. \n\n*and when I say NFT art, it doesn't generalize to ALL NFT art but specific ones that people deem valuable. If I, a random internet stranger, started mining NFT art, it would not be as valuable as, say, Jeff Nezos releasing an NFT art collection.",

There is no \"original\" image, that concept doesn't apply to digital files (squences of 0s and 1s). The NFT is a statement, saing that X account and Y image are together (not even so, more like an url to Y image). The NFT is unique. The image is not. If you download the full image from whatever is it hosted into you can totally make another NFT of it with exact same parameters, except that the new NFT contract will be deployed to a differernt address than the oldNFT contract.\n\nThe dollar bill comparison is misleading, as physical things can have the property of strict uniqueness unlike digital sequences of 0s and 1s (images). Two NFTs referring to the same image are said to be different because they're deployed to two different addressess, not because they're \"unique\" in any way.\n\nWord salad for non technical people, and a bubble about to burst imo.",

Please read the disclaimer, guidelines, and rules before participating.**\n\nRules:\n\n* All [sub rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethereum/about/rules/) apply in this thread.\n* Discussion topics must be related to Ethereum.\n* Behave with civility and politeness. Do not use offensive, racist or homophobic language.\n* Comments will be sorted by newest first.\n\nUseful Links:\n\n* [Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org)\n* [ETHHub](https://ethhub.io/)\n* [ETHMerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/)\n\n**Reminder**\n\n/r/ethereum is a community for discussing the technology, news, applications and community of Ethereum. **Discussion of the Ether price or trading is not allowed.** Please keep those discussions to [/r/ethfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance) and [/r/ethstaker](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**\n\nThere are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.\n\n**When is Eth2 launching?**\n\nEth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. \"The Merge\", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.\n\nVisit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about \"The Merge\".\n\n**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**\n\nNo, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.\n\n**How can I stake my ETH?**\n\nThere are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.\n\n* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details\n* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)\n\n**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**\n\nLike most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.\n\n**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**\n\nEthereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.\n\nAdditionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.\n\nWhile rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.\n\n**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**\n\nThe most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre there questions you'd like to see added? Leave a comment below.",

What is the reason to use a smart contract instead of sending the eth directly?\n\nNot sure exactly in your situation, but exchanges often use multi-sig wallets for security reasons. Multi-sig wallets are built on smart contracts that require multiple signatures to send funds. Normal transactions require only one signature.\n\n>2. My Hardware Wallet only shows the eth balance but not the transaction history like I see on my BTC wallet, when I asked the HW vendor about it they answered the reason for this is because smart contract transactions are not a regular transactions and are not supported by the app.After further research I learned that smart contract transactions aka internal transactions are not recorded on the blockchain.if so, how is it still possible to see the balance of my wallet on sites like etherscan.io? where is this balance coming from?\n\nInternal transactions are not real \"transactions.\" I'll try to simplify this as much as I can: smart contracts are code that lives on the blockchain. That code is made up of a series of \"functions\" that can do things like transfer value (tokens, ETH) from one address to another when executed through a \"function call\" by a normal Ethereum address (a regular wallet). These transfers are not necessarily written on the blockchain, although if these transfers involve ETH they will sometimes appear on-chain (requires extra gas).\n\nHow sites like Etherscan see all the transactions is to go through the history of the entire blockchain and check for these function calls (which do appear on the blockchain) and essentially re-execute them to see/verify the result in the corresponding contract (all the code is publicly available). It sounds like your Wallet visualizer doesn't do that.",

            "selftext": "# Hello r/Ethereum!!\n\nI wanted to mention a project called [Wildland](https://wildland.io). From the leaders of [Qubes OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubes_OS) and [The Golem Project,](https://www.golem.network/) we're developing a set of open-source protocols and software with the aim of giving users back control over their digital data. What this means is that we are developing a new layer where your data is handled. *We are not a storage solution, but a management system that you can use with the flexibility to change storage providers easily.*\n\nWildland abstracts cloud storage, letting you have encrypted storage containers that are portable between cloud providers. It also supports replication between different cloud providers for redundancy and local cache storage for speeding up operations with slower backends.\n\nWe are also developing a [User Defined Organization](https://wildland.io/2022/04/13/UDO-research-WL.html), a new approach DAO for our decentralized governance model which utilizes our ERC-20 token, GLM.\n\n# We are having a live AMA on [Twitter Spaces](https://twitter.com/WildlandIO/status/1514274652385951755) Wednesday, April 20th 6PM CET\n\nand would love to have you join to ask any questions you have about the project. Why are we creating this project?\n\nToday\u2019s Internet is heavily consolidated around several Big Tech service providers, each of them operating their own closely controlled \u201cwalled garden\u201d (i.e. data silo). Centralized, closed services can be very convenient and reliable but they come with heavy strings attached. On top of limited users\u2019 agency there are also well-known problems associated with limited users\u2019 privacy:\n\n* data mining,\n* sharing of data with third parties,\n* behavioral profiling and monetization,\n* moderation of data feeds.\n\n# What we hope to achieve\n\nFreeing users from dependency on service providers by going from a service-oriented Internet where corporations hold the reins, to a data-centered Web where the user is the sovereign. With Wildland we want to:\n\n* give users and developers explicit control over their data and how its handled, so that they can control where it is stored, how it is processed, and what tools they are using to interact with it\n* make it easy for users to switch storage providers, move or replicate data between different storage options, and acquire additional storage space from an open and competitive marketplace\n* let users organize their data in a manner that supports their personal knowledge-management needs and practices\n* allow unmediated publishing and sharing of data without third party supervision or interference\n* create a fertile ecosystem for privacy-conscious app-developers who are willing to put users first\n\n# Empowering users through the User-Defined Organization\n\nWe are developing Wildland around a user-first philosophy, therefore we want users to have the deciding voice on how the platform should operate and evolve.To fulfill this promise we\u2019re developing a new model of governance for Wildland, with the aim of ensuring that the protocol\u2019s heaviest users will have the strongest influence on its future development. We call this governance model the User-Defined Organization.\n\nAny and all feedback are welcome! And stop by our sub r/wildland if you'd like to discuss anything around the project.",

And so far (at least statistically) Ethereum is the best chain out there in terms of sheer numbers.\n\nThis status wouldn\u2019t have possibly been sustainable without scaling solutions stepping up their game and helping people operate Ethereum.\n\nAnd this can all be clearly seen with commit chains like Polygon have more daily active users than Ethereum itself considering you literally pay pennies there compared to double digit gas fees on Ethereum along with things like beinf able to mint NFTs for free there.\n\nPeople want to use Ethereum so bad but would rather do that through scaling solutions.\n\n**TLDR: Ethereum did a great job claiming its spot, but half of the cake goes to scaling solutions for helping Ethereum maintain that position**.",

So like instead of one transaction costing $20, you can have a batch that spends $1000 on gas fees for 2000 transactions, or $0.50 per transaction Layer 2, but still $1000 of fee revenue for Layer 1. The idea being that there's way more users willing to pay the $0.50 on L2 than $20 on L1, so it's still added revenue for L1 even if it's less money spent per user\n\nEventually rollups will be the main players competing for L1 blockspace, and they'll have a lot of money to spend so L1 gas fees will probably be super high, contributing to ETH's scarcity (and thus Layer 1 security because proof of stake)",

They promised it in 2017 and didn't deliver. They'll never release it.\n\nThis is what I see:\n\n* Several iterations of novel distributed consensus research, from Slasher through Casper FFG/CBC to Beacon Chain consensus, the latter of which is powered by a brand new BLS signature aggregation standard.\n\nThis is what you see:\n\n* They literally don't have PoS. It's all vaporware.\n\nThis is what I see:\n\n* A modular Proof of Stake consensus mechanism that's been running in production since November 2020 without any major issues, and that's flexible enough to satisfy the Ethereum network's consensus requirement.\n* Kintsugi, Kiln, and mainnet shadow forks, coordinated across 4+ development teams, leading up to a final production merge.\n\nThis is what you see:\n\n* It'll be impossible to switch over to Proof of Stake, it's like changing out the engine of an airplane mid-flight.\n\nThis is what I see:\n\n* At a predetermined Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD), the system switches from the highly tested and very robust PoW consensus to a highly tested and very robust PoS consensus. The actual \"engine swap\" is completely automatic and will have been tested successfully dozens or hundreds of times using real mainnet data.\n* Also, if we're using the plane analogy, the merge is less like swapping out the engine and more like swapping out the pilot. The engine (Ethereum's execution engine) stays the same.\n\nThis is what you see:\n\n* Ethereum slow and expensive\n\nThis is what I see:\n\n* Ethereum developers choosing not to compromise on the chain's long-term values of security and decentralization for short-term temporary gains in cost and speed.\n\nThis is what you see:\n\n* Ethereum gave up on scaling, left it up to private companies making rollups\n\nThis is what I see:\n\n* Instead of Ethereum's future hinging solely on one idea from a single ivory tower development team, we have a capitalistic, survival-of-the-fittest marketplace for scaling solutions, where priate teams are financially incentivized by free market competition to create the product that scales Ethereum the most efficiently.\n* Instead of focusing on providing scaling, the Ethereum dev team is freed up to focus on the easier problem of providing the tools required for others to provide scaling.\n\nThis is what you say:\n\n* \"I'll believe it when I see it. Until it launches, it doesn't exist.\"\n\nThis is what I say:\n\n* \"I see the code right in front of me. Until it launches, I understand exactly how the system works and at what stage it is in development.\"\n\n*Dear low-information Ethereum critic,*\n\nStop squinting at Ethereum and shouting at me about how blurry it looks. Either put on the goggles or kindly go away. That is all.\n\n---\n\n*Edit for /u/Revanchist1*\n\nThis is what you think of me:\n\n* \"You got lucky! Anyone could have taken that gamble. I was smart enough to avoid gambling in the first place.\"\n\nThis is what I think of you:\n\n* \"It's a real marvel that my calculated investment in this new asset class has paid off. It's too bad that you and the rest of the general public didn't have the specialized expertise in finance and distributed systems engineering to be able to properly understand the risks and estimate the potential rewards of such an investment. I wish there were some way for me to impart my expertise so that other laypeople like you could also benefit from my investment methodology, as it saddens me on some level that this type of expertise contributes towards further increases in the wealth gap.\"",

So the so-called decentralized stable coin is now 60% dependent, indirectly, on a heavily regulated government-friendly institution.\n\nIt doesn't affect the decentralization of the blockchain consensus, but it does affect the decentralization of DeFi (which isn't too decentralized already).",

I am having a hard time wrapping g my head around moving a digital currency to an offline platform.  How do you ensure it is still intact? Is the transfer process the same as moving from let's say Meta Mask to Coinbase?  If you want to want to sell your crypto can you so it directly from a hardware wallet or do you have to go back through an exchange?

As in, even while its effects will start to be felt in June-ish, it's not too drastic in the sense that it will initially only result in slightly longer block-times. So, if the client- and core developers are confident that both the protocol and clients are good to go in late-April, they'll proceed with starting to fork the testnets as a preparation for a mainnet merge.\n\nIf not, the difficulty bomb will be postponed. I wouldn't be surprised if it's still postponed, just so there's a safety net in the case something game-breaking props up.\n\n>It's certainly news to me and something must have happened for that. At least \"X takes longer than we expected\".\n\nThere hasn't really been anything major that has happened. Kiln merged fine, as did the recent mainnet shadow-merge, even wile both had some initial issues on the execution side of things. But that's testing, and the more bugs/bizarre edge-cases that are found, the better.",

The bad news is that the majority of those new games are scamming people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is where I started seeing metaverse guilds; the first one I saw was Yield Guild Games, where many people joined the team because it was a new thing in the space; I also started exploring more and it's really amazing what they're doing; they're supporting a game and then allowing its members to play it for free through a profit-sharing setup. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I continued to explore, I noticed more guilds being established, and Balthazar Team is one of them that caught my attention. They are unique from the others in that they are focusing on helping its members build knowledge in investing, learning more skills as some of its regular members are promoted to a position that helps them manage their discord server, and they are providing awesome research so some people can avoid getting into a scam game at the same time they are getting more investors that are getting interested with the lend-to-earn program. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm dropping the links for the people who are interested and want to benefit from it. \n\n  \n[https://bltzr.gg/team/](https://bltzr.gg/team/) \n\n[https://twitter.com/BalthazarTeam](https://twitter.com/BalthazarTeam)\n\n[https://discord.gg/balthazar](https://discord.gg/balthazar)",

This is the one gripe that a lot of people have with cryptocurrency and why they tend to avoid it completely. I don't avoid it completely but this is STILL something I have issues with and I feel like it isn't talked about enough. \n\nOne thing that I don't think is talked about enough is that Ethereum switching to PoS is going to GREATLY reduce it's carbon footprint. This honestly makes me incredibly excited and it makes me want to use nothing but Ethereum and other PoS chains like Polygon. It is built on Ethereum anyway so it's mostly still on the Ethereum ecosystem IMO. Polygon also very recently put 20 million dollars towards making it's chain environmentally positive, meaning that it's trying to help the environment and undo damage rather than kill it.\n\nI think we all want mass adoption for Ethereum and I think this is a way bigger step towards that than people realize. Crypto is a long-term game and what Ethereum is aiming to achieve is a long-term game. Being the foundation for the web3 layer is going to require a ton of sustainability and I think this is an incredible step foward in the right direction for Ethereum. I believe this will bring a ton of environmentally conscious people towards Ethereum over other chains as well.",

Climate Change is the biggest issue mankind has ever faced, and unfortunately it's what Ian Banks termed an 'Outside Context Problem', something so far beyond what we're used to dealing with that most people are unable to really comprehend it, let alone figure out how to beat it.\n\nSince the beginning of capitalism humans have been largely a one-trick pony with regards to solving problems. Whether the issue has been improving medicine, reducing global hunger, or whatever, the solution has ultimately been 'growth'. By increasing the economy we can fund more research into more medicines and better crops and whatever else. This has unfortunately become something of a religion, the belief that economic growth is the solution to everything.\n\nNow we are facing the physics though, and it turns out 'growth' has been causing a crisis... more economic output has meant more greenhouse gas emissions, pushing our planet towards uninhabitability. At the same time our decision makers are rendered useless with indecision, because the one tool they have relied on up to this point is not going to cut it this time. While our leaders are not leading this struggle, the general population is divided and mislead, distrustful of others and unwilling on an individual or national level to make the sacrifices needed in case other people and groups don't, a global scale 'tragedy of the commons', mixed with jealous concern over the 'freeloader problem' (\"if we give up x to save the world, but 'They' don't, then they get the same benefits as me without having to give anything up, so it's not fair\").\n\nThat's where we are. Things look pretty bleak for human civilization. We need new tools to enable us to coordinate on a global scale to confront what will otherwise be our 'Great Filter'.\n\nWell if you want to keep going down the rabbit hole I'd also recommend the Bankless podcast episode on Moloch:\n\nhttp://podcast.banklesshq.com/33-slaying-moloch-ameen-soleimani-kevin-owocki\n\nAnd once you've listened to that, here's your new favorite podcast series - Kevin Owocki's Green Pill:\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/greenpill/id1609313639\n\nThe first couple of episodes in particular where he inteviews Vitalik and Karl Floersch really set out the vision for how the Ethereum ecosystem has a chance to be the coordination tool that we need. \n\nEthereum is a Schelling point for those who can see that there are big problems to face but haven't given up on the possibility that we might be able to solve them and end up with a future that's better than today.",

That's because they built capacity for the good times. Now they are building (renewable) capacity for the bad times and it is bitcoin miners who consume all the energy in the 99% of times they don't need max capacity. Without bitcoin miners they could not have financed it.\r  \n\r  \nPOW will be vital for the green energy transition because you need flexible baseload consumers to make it economically feasible. None of the 'Bitcoin is bad because of muh energy' crowd even knows what a flexible base load consumer is, let alone that they can come up with an alternative to bitcoin mining. They come up with things like hydrogen production. You can't just shut down a hydrogen plant within 7 seconds as bitcoin miners are required to do in texas.\r  \n\r  \nThen there is methane gas flaring and venting. It is responsible for ca. 2% of global warming. The potential electricity generation of (just the reported) flare gas is 6x what bitcoin currently consumes. Within 5 years every single oil company on the planet will be mining Bitcoin to meet their climate goals;) For small and/or remote drilling sites Bitcoin mining is pretty much T.I.N.A. It will turn Bitcoin into a net negative emission industry. The only net negative industry on this planet.https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/26/exxon-mining-bitcoin-with-crusoe-energy-in-north-dakota-bakken-region.html\r  \n\r  \nhttps://blog.upstreamdata.ca/\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.crusoeenergy.com/blog/5t1IxNQ1ZxTDc2OvaBEERn/green-bitcoin-mining-the-big-profits-in-clean-crypto\r  \n\r  \nStill, ignorance can win. Greenpeace demonized nuclear energy and all we got in exchange for it was more coal. So Bitcoin could meet the same faith as nuclear. No problem if you work on my generational timeline but it could be hard to stomach for the average investor.\r  \n\r  \nTo make ends meet in the short term I like to bet on ignorance and evil because those things often win on shorter time lines. Making money of it eases the pain;) This is why I still hodl ETH.\r  \n\r  \nLet's assume the truth prevails. Imagine 5 years from now when all this baseload consumer stuff is clear to the mainstream. How mislead will ethereum investors feel by ethereum leadership (lol) when they realize they squandered their POW USP for a short term price pump based on energy ignorance and half baked ideas about sharding;)",

This economy of scale ensures distribution of the voting power is even more shifted towards centralization than otherwise. In itself, it wouldn't be a problem as long as the distribution isn't too harshly shifted in such a way. \n\nBut the actual problem is the consequence it has on the biggest mining farms: they are very easy to identify from the electrical grid. And as they're very easy to identify, they're very easy to coerce.\n\nThat's what China has proven with PoW being banned there. We saw the mining power being largely disrupted, for a short period of time. It didn't hurt the network much, but it proved coercion is easy wherever mining farms are.\n\nWe're extremely lucky China has only shutdown mining farms. They could have decided to seize them and use them to censor the chain. They had more than enough mining power on their ground to seize the mining power required for a 51% attack, one from which there is no known strategy efficiently allowing to recover. With such attack, they would have pocketed the entire 2 BTC of each new block (ensuring the profit is extremely profitable to them) and anyone else would have had to mine without earning any profit. \n\nSo, yeah, we're extremely lucky they didn't decide to continue using their power grid for that level of mining. Bitcoin wouldn't have recovered.",

Is \u201cWeb3\u201d going to stay a vague and undefinable term, or does it have a precise definition?\n\nBesides meanings that became obsolete years ago, like \u2018Semantic Web,\u2019 what\u2019s adding to the confusion are all the projects describing themselves as \u201cdecentralized\u201d applications (dApps) or \u201cweb3\u201d, giving the impression that web3 is already here and alive.\n\nYet, as we know, such projects still rely heavily on web2 components: using centralized domains that can be taken away at any moment or compromised, centralized storage that is censorable and transparent to mass surveillance, and browser extensions like Metamask or Phantom that Google can disable at any time, which would immediately leave 99% of the users of \u201cdecentralized\u201d applications helplessly confused about how to access them. BadgerDAO, a DeFi project hacked for $120M because of centralized UI, shows why this \u201cWeb 2.5\u201d approach is in the wrong direction.\n\n**World\u2019s First Full Web3 Architecture**\n\nTo correct this, Point Labs began working on recreating all components of the old internet with their decentralized implementations. Instead of clinging to existing web2 scaffolding, the resulting network, nicknamed Point Network, is a virtual space completely disconnected from the old internet, just like blockchains are, which can now be called Web 3.0.\n\nPoint Network architecture consists of decentralized domains (.point) which live on the blockchain, decentralized storage on Arweave, decentralized identities, and other tools that help bridge the gap between Web 2.5 and full Web 3.\n\nWhen you open Point Browser, there is no connection to [facebook.com](https://facebook.com/), [google.com](https://google.com/), or any IP addresses from the old internet (if you try to open a web2 link, you will be redirected to your normal browser). Instead, Point Network forces the developers to use only decentralized components to deploy their dApps, ensuring censorship-resistance, data integrity, data availability, privacy, and enhanced security.\n\n\u201cThe Roadmap to Web3\u201d\n\nThis combination, founders insist, is the most straightforward definition of Web 3.0: a long-standing dream of technology enthusiasts to have a completely decentralized internet, free of censorship, mass surveillance, and empowering direct ownership of data and audiences, without Big Tech intermediaries taking their cut and asserting dictatorship-like control. But how far are we from achieving this?\n\nPoint Labs produced their first prototype a year ago, bootstrapping its development with their own funds. Then, in October 2021, they presented the first alpha version on Solana Ignition Hackathon, which placed them on the Honorary Mentions list and led to raising their Seed and A rounds by venture capital firms, including notable names such as Arweave, Petrock Capital and Solar Eco Fund, and led by Sino Global+FTX fund, which funded a second alpha version, which is now more functional and easier to use.\n\nThis week, Point Labs presented their roadmap. And it\u2019s not just a typical ribbon-shaped block on a landing page. Instead, they made it into a whole Trello-like website, which is hosted on [roadmap.pointnetwork.io](https://roadmap.pointnetwork.io/), called \u201cThe Roadmap to Web3 \u201d and is frequently updated. It features two zones: the main zone, presenting the infrastructure required for decentralized internet and is almost done, and the dApp zone, listing use cases and potential decentralized applications for when the main zone is ready and operational.\n\n**The Megaround**\n\nBecause it is hard for one company to develop all dozens of dApps required for the full Web 3.0 experience, the current plans are to have one last private VC round dubbed \u2018The Megaround\u2019 before the public launch at the end of May, to provide grants to interested teams and founders to incentivize building web3 apps on Point Network. After that, the plans are to launch the mainnet beta by June 1.\n\nAs the interest in web3 grows, there will definitely emerge a few projects running for the honor of becoming the golden standard. Is Point Network on the way to be one of them? It seems we\u2019re just a few months away from finding out.",

Once they do, it will potentially be way cheaper to make an ens domain, make a change in your ens domain, and staking my ETH won\u2019t have as large a fee to stake.\n\nI guess I\u2019m really asking if layer 2s don\u2019t help until the platform I want to use it supports it right?\n\nAlso, let\u2019s say ENS supports loopring in the future.  I can move my ETH to loopring, but I would also need to buy a little LRC which would be used for gas fees instead of ETH?\n\nAm I understanding this correctly?\n\nThanks in advance!",

The Ethereum network\u2019s merge into PoS is expected to make the network faster, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly due to the high energy consumption required to run PoW. The merge is expected to be fully implemented in the second half of 2022. So, if you are confident that it will go through without a hitch, then you might consider adding some ETH to your portfolio.\n\nDo you think it's truly a big deal? \n\n[Source](https://swapzone.io/blog/ethereum-pos-first-shadow-fork)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ht45vf6r3t81.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=59f12115f02cea5099baf787df68b22e45858ac1",

To go further we should weigh the emissions of the individual as well - gas consumed to drive to work, meat eaten, etc. not an easy task. \n\nI think we must weigh how the eth was procured to validate with, as much as we analyze the emissions of a asic or gpu miner. Sometimes we think the impact is 0 for PoS. Very difficult to do, but just illustrating how the calculations in ones own head should be open. \n\nJust my opinion. Cheers!",

Notably, it's a key component of Ethereum's success. Most Dapps rely on this. Even the core of Ethereum relies on this. \n\nAnd yet, more and more Dapps seem to be attracted to the demand to require KYC and thus reintroduce trust. ShapeShift has shown a way to get rid of this, but I can understand some people aren't ready to lose control over their Dapps. \n\nThe question is: if you keep control and yet can be coerced into implementing some KYC and have to use it and do whatever someone else asks you to, depending on such KYC result, are you really sure you're still having control anyway? \n\nSo, to remind of the utmost important of trustlessness and how to still build trust from it, here's an old, yet still very relevant and fun mini-game on trust, about game theory. Here's the evolution of trust: \n\nhttps://ncase.me/trust",

Ethereum is enabling a world in which company treasuries are controlled by votes delegated to NFTs providing access to privileged information. This is so much more efficient than the top-down corporate system that it's a significant value potential. \n\nThat said, I'd totally sell an ape and any useless apecoins because ETH is the store of value, and there are many better DAOs to get involved in (bullish on Doodles).",

Personally from owning an Angels and Devils NFT and being a part of their community I would rather hold the A&D but I also can't say I'm likely to hold the A&D for the next 10 years just depends on how well their video game and comic book go. Now ETH has about 6 years of updates scheduled they plan on staying competitive and relevant, so I think holding ETH is a good idea especially if you feel the community you bought into isn't going to bring the holders of the NFT value.",

This issuance reduction of ~90% is equivalent to three Bitcoin halvening events happening at the same time.\n\nReducing issuance in perpetuity is good (for holders).\n\nDeflationary means that issuance is not only reduced, but goes negative. After the merge, and combined with EIP-1559 an average gas cost of ~20 gwei will actually mean that more ETH is being burned than issued per block and supply will slowly reduce over time.\n\nReducing supply in perpetuity is even better (for holders).",

It's a self-regulated mechanism when a low enough circulating supply ensures a lower quantity of ETH burnt and thus ends up reducing deflation, until it's stopped. And inflation can even temporarily come back if people don't want to burn enough ETH anymore.\n\nBut yes, I'm also only adding details and agree with you.",

The network is now switching to proof-of-stake (PoS), which can be faster and more energy-efficient.\n\nDetails: A shadow fork basically is a critical point in this migration where data can now be shared on both chains. Basically, it is huge news for Ethereum developers and traders.\n\nHistory: Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap, has been pegged by some experts to overtake Bitcoin in 2022. Obviously, that hasn\u2019t happened yet.\n\nNumbers: Despite the shadow fork on Monday, the price of Ethereum fell about 6%. However, most cryptos had a bad Monday as well, which has been attributed to rising interest rates.\n\nFinal Thoughts: At this point, Ethereum is still down for the year.\n\nHope you enjoyed this commentary.

Any ideas?\n\nBack in 2016 on the myetherwallet.com website they used to offer the option of bulk wallets which you could additionally encrypt with a password. It would then print out both the address and the encrypted private key of those encrypted wallets. And in 2016 the website let you use an encrypted private key with password to send a transaction from the website.\n\nSo this person has one of those encrypted private keys and the correct password.\n\n but mow myetherwallet.com will no longer accept a private encrypted key for a private key to access the wallet. \n\nNot even v5.myetherwallet.com will allow a ENCRYPTED private key although that website WILL allow you to enter a regular private key and immediately transfer the contents of the wallet somewhere else which is what this person wants to do. (He did it already with a couple of regular private keys.\n\nSo we need to decrypt the private encrypted key and turn it into a regular private key to able to use v5.myetherwallet.com to empty this wallet of his.\n\nOddly enough if you use archive.org and go back to 2016 to the myetherwallet.com page it offers you the chance to decrypt the private encrypted key. however it only then allows you to send a transaction rather than actually showing you what the private key looks like when it's unencrypted!\n\n It does also derive the correct wallet address so it appears like it is doing the decryption correctly for his encrypted private key and password. And it does it even though it's on archive.org so it must be some JavaScript doing that or something that was saved by archive.org in 2016.\n\nBut because it's running on archive.org that old website won't allow you to construct a transaction file so thats not an option either.\n\nAnd Unfortunately the new 2021 version 5 of the myetherwallet.com website does not allow you to enter a ENCRYPTED private key to decrypt.\n\nSo that leaves the current problem.\n\nNow the myetherwallet.com website is open source and you can get on GitHub and you can see that THE 2016 ARCHIVE.ORG version of myetherwallet.com has got a bunch of JavaScript running to do the decryption.\n\n I don't know what it connects to in the back but I'm just not an expert enough in the programming to see the JavaScript function that actually turns  an encrypted private key into a decrypted regular private key when you put in the password. I just can't figure out how it's doing it.\n\nAny help is appreciated!\n\nI wonder how many other people have old mew official encrypted private keys printed out that they are having trouble using!\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEdit for reference here is the old 2016 website that handled  encrypting and decrypting private keys\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20160101234647/https://www.myetherwallet.com/\n\nOf you go to the \"send\" menu and choose enter private key if you enter an encrypted one it senses it and pops up a box to enter the password and then pops up a button that says \"decrypt\" and it will then decrypt it but only show the address and offer to build a transaction file .",

Back in 2018 one of the first places we learned about about Web3 was [r/ethereum](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/) and [r/ethfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/). Some of our team members actually started learning about crypto specifically to support workers in the global labor movement and they started with Ethereum. Now, years later that vision is finally coming to reality because the time is right for unions and DAO's have matured.\n\nHere's some writing that was done a few months back:\n\n[https://twitter.com/thelabordao/status/1498701388716691458?s=20&t=HcCVgb5aX2\\_Lu1LR964\\_rA](https://twitter.com/thelabordao/status/1498701388716691458?s=20&t=HcCVgb5aX2_Lu1LR964_rA)\n\nThe labor movement has been at a serious disadvantage in the money game and Web3 is a turning point in that history. The recent victory at Amazon by workers at Amazon Labor Union is a perfect example of what the Labor Movement is capable of.\n\nThose [workers won their union at Amazon with less than $100k](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvnkxa/the-amazon-labor-union-took-on-the-worlds-richest-manand-won) so imagine what they could do with real resources.\n\nThe problem is that many people in the labor movement, like in most industries, don't yet realize that crypto / web3 isn't some magic internet money scam that only cares about monkey and cat NFTs (Some of that stuff is cool and funny by the way).\n\nWe're here to prove that it isn't by [activating a real use case to support workers who want to bargain, strike and organize](https://mirror.xyz/0x41E84f0e4417eDf440DDc2558Df13877552Db39A/C7befGqsLiT9Z4VSLT-bqpacg1nxoqpnOq3Q7elXo9U). We will follow in the footsteps of UkraineDAO, AssangeDAO, and many more building a DAO that will make real change in the world and be led by its members.\n\nSet a reminder for the very first LaborDAO Space where we'll be joined by an exciting group of speakers and a special guest from Amazon Labor Union.\n\nWe'll also share more LaborDAO and our plans over the next few months.\n\n[https://twitter.com/thelabordao/status/1512938215551946760?s=20&t=p29xKcro0ZIxNhekqgnWNQ](https://twitter.com/thelabordao/status/1512938215551946760?s=20&t=p29xKcro0ZIxNhekqgnWNQ)\n\nP.S. Does anyone have a link to that historical article Vitalik wrote more than a decade ago about using Ethereum to support workers? We can't find it despite searching very hard. We know it exists.\n\nIn Solidarity,\n\nLaborDAO Contributor",

Do not use offensive, racist or homophobic language.\n* Comments will be sorted by newest first.\n\nUseful Links:\n\n* [Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org)\n* [ETHHub](https://ethhub.io/)\n* [ETHMerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/)\n\n**Reminder**\n\n/r/ethereum is a community for discussing the technology, news, applications and community of Ethereum. **Discussion of the Ether price or trading is not allowed.** Please keep those discussions to [/r/ethfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance) and [/r/ethstaker](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**\n\nThere are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.\n\n**When is Eth2 launching?**\n\nEth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. \"The Merge\", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.\n\nVisit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about \"The Merge\".\n\n**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**\n\nNo, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.\n\n**How can I stake my ETH?**\n\nThere are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.\n\n* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details\n* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)\n\n**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**\n\nLike most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.\n\n**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**\n\nEthereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.\n\nAdditionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.\n\nWhile rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.\n\n**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**\n\nThe most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre there questions you'd like to see added? Leave a comment below.",

Decentralized applications (dApps), built primarily on Ethereum, showcase the true potential of decentralization.  Blockchain technology is, however, still far from mainstream adoption. Ethereum as a network is congested, transaction speeds are low, and costs are high. These issues have become barriers to scalability and have led to the birth of other blockchains.\n\nCross-chain integration and interoperability are imperative to overcome these barriers. A value transfer system needs to be created that allows both the users and developers to leverage the solutions offered by these new chains.\n\nDifferent blockchains are written in different languages. Ethereum is written in Solidity. For a dApp to have multi-chain variants, the code needs to be re-written in all different languages, which is extremely cumbersome.\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) makes it easier to transfer value between Ethereum and other blockchains without the need for new infrastructure. This connects the different silos of the blockchain with similar ecosystem components and toolkits requiring little-to-no change. There is no need for developers to use different technology stacks to reimplement existing Solidity backend contracts and dApp front ends.\n\nThis paper delves into the existing solutions that help to bridge these different blockchains by simply copying the code from Ethereum to other blockchains with minimal changes thus reducing transaction costs.\n\n## The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\n\nEthereum has become the functional layer of the blockchain and the smart contract world. A smart contract is just like any other real-world contract, except it\u2019s digital. In programming lingo, a smart contract is a computer program consisting of self-executing pieces of code that execute when preset conditions are met. Smart contracts are written in programming languages like Solidity, Viper, Bamboo, and others. A processor does not understand programming languages and hence cannot execute smart contracts. That brings us to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). **The EVM is the heart of the Ethereum blockchain.**\n\nThe EVM serves as a computational engine, just like a CPU, and acts as a middle layer between the smart contract and the operating system. Contracts written in programming languages are compiled to low-level machine instructions called opcodes or operational codes. The EVM uses these codes to execute specific tasks. It thus provides the **run time environment** for smart contracts on Ethereum.\n\nAny distributed network needs to have consensus, whereby every node on the network has the same information about the state of the network. For Ethereum, the EVM enables consensus, allowing anyone to execute code in a trustless ecosystem. The outcome of execution (smart contracts) can be guaranteed and is fully deterministic. It creates a **level of abstraction** between the executing code and the executing machine.\n\nEthereum\u2019s state is a large data structure that holds all accounts and balances. It is also a **machine state**, which can change from block to block according to a predefined set of rules. At any given block, there can only be a single state of the blockchain. Ethereum maintains its state with the help of EVM, which does this by defining the rules for computing a new valid state.\n\nIn short, EVM exists as one single entity maintained by thousands of connected computers running an Ethereum client. It is operating system-agnostic, and without it, each operating system would need a separate compiler.\n\n## How the EVM Works\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o38knrwo7os81.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f0665620473bc670af0cd3285758cfca0511fa4\n\nAt a **basic level**, the EVM can be considered a translator from the smart contract language to the Ethereum nodes. It enables developers to build and deploy dApps (without the need for an extensive coding background). It makes the process of creating blockchain applications much easier and more efficient while eliminating the need for powerful hardware. The EVM has no downtime and keeps all created objects safe from being modified.\n\nAt a **technical level**, EVM is a sandboxed virtual stack embedded within each Ethereum node, responsible for executing contract bytecode. Contracts written in higher-level languages, like Solidity, are compiled to EVM bytecode. The machine codes are completely isolated without any access to the network, filesystem, or any processes of the host computer (hosting the VM). Every node in the Ethereum network runs an EVM instance, which allows them to agree on executing the same instructions. Due to the set of opcodes, the EVM is Turing complete.  A Turing complete system is capable of performing any logical step of a computational function, and that means it should theoretically be able to solve any computational problem. JavaScript, the programming language which powers the worldwide web, widely uses Turing completeness. Ethereum Virtual Machines have been successfully implemented in various programming languages including C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and many others.\n\nThere are two types of accounts in Ethereum \u2013 **external accounts and contracts**. Every account is identified by an address, consisting of a balance, a nonce, bytecode, and stored data (*storage*). The code and storage of external accounts are empty, while contract accounts store their bytecode and the Merkle-root hash of the entire state tree. External accounts have a corresponding private key while contract accounts don\u2019t. The actions of contract accounts are controlled by the code they host, in addition to the regular cryptographic signing of every Ethereum transaction. The creation of a contract is simply a transaction in which the receiver address is empty and its data field contains the compiled bytecode of the contract to be created.\n\nThe first thing that happens when a new contract is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain is account creation. The data sent with the transaction is executed as bytecode. This initializes the state variables in storage and determines the body of the contract being created. The process is executed only once during the lifecycle of a contract. Once a contract account has been created, there is no way to change its code. The EVM treats both accounts the same. A transaction sent from one account to the other can contain **Ether** or **binary** data (payload). If it contains code, it is executed and the payload becomes input data. If it is not set, the code sent is executed and returns the code for a new contract. During the construction, the code of the contract is empty.\n\nBeing decentralized, contracts are executed on all Ethereum nodes. This raises the risk of bad actors slowing down the network intentionally by creating a lot of complex contracts. To protect against such attacks, every opcode has a **base gas cost**. For any smart contract to be executed by the EVM, each and every line of code in Solidity requires a certain amount of gas to be executed. The gas is used as per the execution cost assigned to the instruction implemented by the EVM. \n\nBy using the Gas mechanism, two major issues are solved. A validator is guaranteed to receive the initial prepaid amount, even if the execution fails. An execution cannot run longer than the prepaid amount would allow. Instead of looping indefinitely, the execution would run until it runs out of Gas.\n\nWhen a transaction is sent to the network, validators may take the transaction, executing the associated code.

So the question is, how fast it would take to complete all that transactions being made at the same time? I did that simple math:\n\n\\- each \\~14 seconds a new block is minted on Ethereum - each block has capacity around 70 transactions (with a default gas of 21000), if everyone mint 1 nft at the same time (so 55k transactions), it could took around 785 blocks to finish the mint (70 transactions per block, so 55,000 / 70), so the answer is AT LEAST 183 minutes (785 blocks \\* 14 seconds).\n\nIs that logic correct? If the logic is correct, and considering that a lot of other transactions exist on blockchain and are disputing for the same block, it would take even longer, but kind of surprise to imagine it can't take less than 3 hours to have that process done even when thinking in a super unlikely situation (when there isn't any other transactions on the blockchain).",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m in a slump. I spent more than a year on an app that helped people build better habits. But it didn\u2019t make any money, so I started working on an app for a big organization. Working there killed my soul.\n\nI needed something new. While listening to the Tim Ferriss podcast, I kept hearing about Web3.\n\nWeb3 sounded like another crypto thing I didn\u2019t want to hear about. But after the podcast; I became a believer.\n\nWeb3 was going to help us move away from big corporations to individual creators. Changing the web as we know it. No one knows where Web3 is going, but that\u2019s part of the fun.\n\nI started learning how to build applications for web3. Building the future would get me out of my slump. But learning takes time. I wanted to get involved right away.\n\nA big part of Web3 is NFTs. When people think of NFTs, they think of weird internet images. People buy, sell and create these NFTs and they are all tracked on a big ledger called the blockchain.\n\nWeb3 proves who owns what. Owning an NFTs give you access to communities, bragging rights and a bunch of other stuff I don\u2019t understand. NFTs would be my way of joining the Web3 revolution. It was the 1st of January 2022 and I wanted my own NFT.\n\nWithin minutes, it was clear I was late to the party. The most popular NFTs, \u201cCrypto Punks\u201d and \u201cBored Apes,\u201d were going for millions. I\u2019d missed the train before they\u2019d released the timetable.\n\nThe lowest price I found for a popular NFT on the auction website Opensea was $30,000. What is going on? Maybe I could lowball someone for an NFT. It is an auction, after all. Fuck it, there was no minimum price to bid. I bid $20 on one of the \u201cCool Cats\u201d NFTs, which go for thousands. Not sure if my bid went through. I tried again, bidding another $20 and paying the fee again. The fee had left my crypto wallet, but nothing appeared on the website. I refreshed the auction page. I had bid $20 twice. The fees I paid were almost higher than my bids. No one would accept these bids. I had just thrown money into the void.\n\nI told myself it was ok, in uncharted land, explorers make mistakes.\n\nI couldn\u2019t afford anything from the auction. My low ball approach was dumb. How do I get an NFT before it\u2019s on the auction? I then discovered minting. Minting is where you pay the fee for a new project to get your own NFT.\n\nOn the \u201cCool Cats\u201d auction page, there was a link to the \u201cCool Cats\u201d website. Maybe I could mint my own NFT there? The \u201cCool Cats\u201d website was weird. It mentioned breeding NFTs and a lot of other things I didn\u2019t understand. After scrolling, I realised \u201cCool Cats\u201d had created all the 10,000 cat NFTs they had planned. If I wanted one, I\u2019d have to buy it at the auction. Fuck.\n\nOn the \u201cCool Cats\u201d website, they had a link to their Discord. I thought Discord was just for angry teenagers. But it\u2019s where everything happens for NFTs. I clicked on the discord link.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to use discord. When it first loaded up, I got a burst hose pipe of notifications. I was a boomer for the first time. People talking about trades, $50,000 purchases and roadmaps for new plans. I had notifications, but I had no idea how to make them disappear.\n\nAlong with the official messages, there were messages to join other communities. I joined a bunch of these communities at once. I wanted to sample all the ice creams in the store. These smaller communities had funny names like \u201cAge of Sam\u201d, \u201cThe Honey Badger,\u201d and \u201cBored Apes Dad Club\u201d. If Discord confused me before, I had full-blown dementia now. With each community, I got more notifications.\n\nI tackled the groups one by one. First, I clicked \u201cBored Apes Dad Club\u201d. It had 79000 members. Was that a lot? I had no idea. But if other people trusted it, I trusted it. All you had to do to verify was type a message saying \u2018!join\u2019 and then they channel messaged you with a link to a website to verify your wallet. The wallet that holds all your internet money.\n\nI clicked on the verify link and a login popped up. This was strange. My wallet is a google chrome plugin that should always keep me logged in. Did it time out for a security measure? I typed in my password without thinking. The plugin accepted it. But it said for additional security information, it needed my secret phrase. Must be like when your phone says it needs you to enter your pin. I went and got my secret phrase and entered it. When I entered it, nothing happened. It just said error. I entered my password and secret phrase for the second time.\n\nThis is when I realized I had fucked up.\n\nWhat I had entered my password and secret phrase into wasn\u2019t the official plugin. It looked the same, but it belonged to some randomer living in a shack in a different country.\n\nGiving away your password wasn\u2019t the end of the world. The end of the world was that I had given away my secret phrase. You should never give away your secret phrase. With your secret phrase, anyone can access all of your accounts. I\u2019d just given my secret phrase away twice.\n\nI googled what to do if you\u2019ve given your secret phrase away. Hoping for a reset password system or something. The website told me I\u2019d fucked up. I had to transfer everything to a new account. Which meant fees to transfer and the guilt of being dumb.\n\nWithin ten seconds of not paying attention, a hacker could now access all of my internet money. This wasn\u2019t the start I wanted for my new year.\n\nA better person than me would have realised they needed to be more careful. But I\u2019m not a better person. I still wanted my NFT.\n\nI figured I had some time before the randomer would steal all my money. Like all addicts, I looked for my next hit.\n\nAnother community was offering a mint in six days. It cost about \u00a3150 to mint one NFT, this seemed expensive. But everything had been expensive. Maybe \u00a3150 was a good price? But I kept looking for a better deal.\n\nI joined another community called \u2018Littles\u2019. Their verification didn\u2019t require a password. This community had active members, people reporting scams, and FAQs. Maybe I just had bad luck with my first attempt?\n\nWhile in the \u2018Littles\u2019. I received a message from \u201cThe little info\u201d saying:\n\n\u201cWE ARE LAUNCHING A LIMITED SALE. For the new year we\u2019re offering 777 pixels to be minted.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m in luck! I clicked the link, and they\u2019d minted 764 out of 777. Shit, I\u2019m going to miss my opportunity. It cost \u00a3300 to mint here. I looked up the prices of the \u2018littles\u2019. The littles sold for $30,000. It was double the price to mint these compared to the other group. But these were making 100 times the rate of return. I refreshed the page, and the number had gone up to 770. There were only 7 left. It was now or never.\n\nI scanned the website to make sure I wasn\u2019t getting scammed. The website looked legit, with its own security certificate and the URL littlepixel.art seemed to match the discord channel.\n\nFortune favours the brave. I clicked on the link that said \u201cmint\u201d. This time, a real transaction came up with the correct price, including the fee.\n\nWas I about to spend \u00a3300 to get my own online internet image of a cartoon bear? Yes\u2026 I was. I clicked \u2018confirm\u2019.\n\nIt went through and brought me back to the webpage. Bit underwhelming. I was hoping for some confetti. But the blockchain takes time. I went to my transaction history expecting to see a minting job; but it just said I had sent someone \u00a3300. I had no NFT in my wallet.\n\nOn the blockchain, you can see every transaction. Which meant I could look up my transaction to see where I sent my \u00a3300. Turns out I had sent \u00a3300 to a random wallet with $77,000 in it.\n\nI went back to the littlepixel.art website. Everything looked legit, but the links on the top didn\u2019t work. Fuck.\n\nIn the scam section of the discord, someone had reported the website as a known scam.\n\nI thought the message from the \u2018littles info\u2019 had come from the official channel. Because of its name and profile picture. But no, it was a direct message meant to confuse boomers like me.\n\nIn only ten minutes, I\u2019d given access to all my accounts to a randomer and then sent about \u00a3300 to another scammer.\n\nThis was a major defeat. Worst of all, it was the first thing I\u2019d done in January 2022.\n\nI had lost track of time as the NFT fever had taken over. I forgot my sister had got us a gift to go to a trampoline park. We were leaving for the park in five minutes. Before the person with my secret phrase stole everything I had left in my wallet, I needed to create a new account.\n\nI set up a new wallet and attempted to transfer everything over. I clicked send. But it failed with some obscure message saying \u201cgas fee to low\u201d. Shit. I didn\u2019t have time for this and didn\u2019t feel like explaining to my sister we\u2019d be late because I just lost \u00a3300 trying to mint an image of a teddy bear. I tried again by clicking the most recent contact in the list \u2018OxFefhrysgjohjhljkklskd\u2019 or whatever the address was. This time it sent. Thank god.\n\nDestroyed, I walked away, never wanting to hear the word NFT again. I tried to persuade myself that it was ok. It was a tuition fee. But inside I was bitter.\n\nOn the trampolines, I tried to bounce out of my depression. Wondering if anyone else in the trampoline park had just lost money trying to buy their own \u201clittle\u201d that morning.\n\nAfter taking my anger out in the gladiator arena of the trampoline park, I got home feeling better. I still had some money to work with.\n\nI loaded up the new wallet. It was empty. There was no way the money hadn\u2019t gone through. It had been hours. I logged into my old wallet. It said I had sent the money.\n\nWhat was going on? Maybe the person with my secret phrase had emptied the wallet? I clicked on the location I had sent the rest of my money to. It said I sent the rest of my money to the same scammers\u2019 wallet with $77,000. That couldn\u2019t be. I refreshed the page and tried again\u2026\n\nMy gut tightened. I realised what had happened. When I tried to transfer the rest of my money to my new account, the first time, it error\u2019d. Then when I tried again instead of pasting my new wallet address, I clicked the most recent contact in my addresses. Thinking it was like the most recent person you\u2019ve called on your phone. It wasn\u2019t. The address I clicked was the contact of the last successful transaction. I had just sent the same scammer the rest of my internet money.\n\nThis was the dumbest thing I\u2019d ever done.\n\nIn denial, feeling like Liam Neeson, I tried to figure out who the owner of the wallet was. Hoping I could beg for my money back. I followed where the owner of the $77,000 wallet had transferred the money out. It was a bigger wallet with over $1 million. But the million dollar wallet had withdrawn the funds out in dollars via another website. I\u2019d never know who they were. My money was gone forever, and I had no NFT to show for it.\n\nI should scam people instead of learning how to build things.-- If you liked this you can get one free story every week here: [https://www.reecekidd.com/sign-up/](https://www.reecekidd.com/sign-up/)",

Sorry it happened to you but consider it a $300+ lesson. Your journey was probably similar to many others, people can read this post and not make the same mistakes. Make sure to disable DMs in new discord servers you join, there are inflated fake discord user numbers, discords mods and admins can get hacked and send out links in official channels. Don't move so fast that you forget to take the time to double check. The only surefire way to make money with NFTs is to make your own. Otherwise you need to be early, and sell the hype.

Like damn sorry that happened, but this money was lost anyways\n\nI would recommend you not to do anything else in this space but buy btc/eth, for a while at least. No offense but this whole thing was just a large series of horrible short sighted decisions built on top of a completely misguided thesis, I think it\u2019s time to take a break and examine your judgement.

No way to provide fine-grained control over the amount?\n2. What does it mean by all-or-nothing?\n3. How does the hack example work?\n\n\"**Value-blindness - there is no way for a UTXO script to provide fine-grained control over the amount that can be withdrawn**. For example, one powerful use case of an oracle contract would be a hedging contract, where A and B put in $1000 worth of BTC and after 30 days the script sends $1000 worth of BTC to A and the rest to B. This would require an oracle to determine the value of 1 BTC in USD, but even then it is a massive improvement in terms of trust and infrastructure requirement over the fully centralized solutions that are available now.\n\nHowever, because **UTXO are all-or-nothing**, the only way to achieve this is through the very inefficient hack of **having many UTXO of varying denominations (eg. one UTXO of 2k for every k up to 30) and having O pick which UTXO to send to A and which to B**.\"",

                    "response": "If I remember well, it's a critique of Bitcoin and how it handles the division of your Bitcoins whenever you send it.\n\nTo keep it simple, Bitcoin uses coins you divide each time you need to send a coin of different value. For instance, you're a miner paid 10 BTC from a block reward (to keep it simple). This is one coin, called a UTXO, an input created for you and sent to your wallet. If you then want to send 2 BTC to someone else, the network actually splits your 10 BTC coin into two, one of 8 BTC and one of 2 BTC, sending the 2 BTC to whatever wallet you wanted to and sending back to you as an input the 8 BTC coin.\n\nThis creates several problems. Notably, it ensures wallets get heavier in space over time, as coins keep getting divided into smaller coins. This means you can end up having to deal with more coins to sort through and, thus, transactions of higher complexity, costing you more and more over time. \n\nIt also creates a vulnerability, called a dust attack, where several wallets can send several very small coins to a target wallet, so that target wallet ends up in such a state it can't send any transaction anymore, because the complexity of any transaction it would create would be higher than the maximum complexity the network accepts.\n\nMathematically and in computer science, it's called the backpack problem, where sorting through your items in your backpack is increasingly difficult if you don't have a specific diversity of items to sort (it's actually also the problem of giving back change regarding a payment).\n\nThe all-or-nothing concept is the very fact you can't send a part of an UTXO without having to split it. If you have to make some change, it necessarily means you have to split some UTXO, increasing the entropy of the available UTXO. \n\nJust to be clear, the hack he's talking about isn't about some hacker malevolently profiting from the system at the expense of others. It's about an inelegant tweak of the mechanism by core devs, a work around of the limitations of how UTXO deal with data inputs and outputs and the distribution of value between these UTXO. \n\nThat white paper was originally written when there wasn't much more than Bitcoin itself. So, it is heavily making references to bitcoin, without necessarily mentioning it.",

Address C is the \"change address\", it's an address you own that will let you spend those 0.9 BTC in the future. The way Bitcoin scripts work is if you can spend the funds associated with address A, then you have to spend **all** of them when you do. This change address thing is just a nice abstraction that wallet clients take care from you.\n\nEthereum doesn't have an UTXO model, it has an account model. If you have 1 ETH and you send 0.1 ETH, then your account balance is simply decreased by 0.1 and the receiver's account is increased by 0.1. No unspent outputs, no change address, etc. \n\nWhat Vitalik meant is in his example of a hedging contract is you don't know how much 1000 USD in BTC will be in the future, so a UTXO-based smart contract would have to have enough UTXO's to cover all possibilities. Just like how in real life you have a combination of coins and bills and you always want to give the least amount of coins/bills to make any change from $0.01 to $99.99, and if you're missing pennies then you can't make change when the cents ends in anything other than 0 to 5. Now imagine if the dollar was divisible into millions of units, not just hundreds. You'd have to constantly break pennies into subpennies and break subpennies into subsubpennies in order to make sure you'll have all the coins necessary to make change for an unpredictable amount like $1.46256949\n\nAll this inefficiency goes away if you never have to deal with change in the first place and only have to increase/decrease a number.",

            "selftext": "I discovered an interesting article that explains Ethereum, whether you're a newbie or not it's quite useful. The Ethereum network is frequently referred to as the Web3 foundation layer, although its native asset, ETH, does not have a precise meaning.  \n\n\nThe second-biggest blockchain has come a long way since its inception, Ethereum blockchain is very important since it powers about 95% of the NFT ecosystem. Now, we must use LUDO or similar search engines that look like Google for NFTs so we can catch up with all these new collections.  \n\n\nI like how Bankless co-host David Hoffman attempted to describe ETH in terms of the existing monetary system.  \nHe said that when ETH is staked, it becomes a capital asset since it creates income and may thus be valued based on its predicted returns, similar to bonds. When ETH is used as a payment method for transactions, it takes the function of a consumable asset, similar to how US dollars are used to pay taxes. Finally, when holders deposit ETH into DeFi protocols, it works as a store of value.  \n\n\nThis definition is the foundation of the Ethereum ecosystem. It illustrates the many dynamics driving the price of ETH while also opening the way for greater acceptance and growth. It also demonstrates how ETH is comparable to crucial assets in conventional economies. The Ethereum ecosystem, for example, can identify the trifecta of US currencies, US government bonds, and IRS taxes that comprise the US economy.  \n\n\nSo, what do you think, what is your definition of Ethereum? \n\n[ Source: Bankless ](https://preview.redd.it/xmlmha8ab4s81.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dd401305086719c5de2a0c3328ac73a71c5933b)",

It's a bit more than 3 of such halvings happening at the same time. \n\nMoving to an L2 can be tricky for some Dapps. Notably, Dapps that handle funds are very tricky. You can hardly ask your users to get away from your platform and join a new platform in an L2.\n\nI guess the shift will happen from new Daps that will directly be deployed on an L2. Older Dapps will then be forced to find a way to move into L2s in order to compete.\n\nThis or maybe some Dapps will invest in developping new tokens that record the user state for that DApp, which would be compatible accross several layers or even accross chains. Some kind of export token. \n\nAfter all, it's all about messaging. You can very well embed the user state in a message, a token, so that you can freely own and move that message elsewhere or even sell that state to someone else. \n\nObviously, if you cross the borders of a layer or a chain, internally stored funds also need to move, which would be a transaction in itself, possibly an expensive one. But I think this is doable. \n\nFor instance, you have funds in a huge pool of a stablecoin. You could try and export this state of owning such funds into a compatible smart contract of another L2, which would then asks from you to move the funds (internally from one smart contract to another, calling for some bridge to move the funds, which means the smart contract would need to implement such function) before being able to access the funds in the Dapp in that other L2.",

Liquidity is the lifeblood of any protocol and facilitating that liquidity in one way or another is a basic prerequisite for a successful project.\n\nWhen Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap were the dominant DEXes, liquidity mining was relatively straightforward. All liquidity deposits on those exchanges are natively fungible, meaning that any deposit is directly comparable to any other one. Additionally, all liquidity deposits on those exchanges \u201ccover\u201d the full price range of the two assets in the pool, meaning that the AMM formula would serve up a price if token0 approached  an infinite value relative to token1 and, similarly, if token1  approached an infinite value relative to token0.\n\nUniswap V3 is now the dominant DEX, owing largely to its more expressive functionality. But with a richer feature-set comes greater complexity. One major casualty of Uniswap V3 is that liquidity mining now requires a profound technical expertise. Even launching an incentive on the full  price range \u2014 the most common approach to Uni V3 LM to date \u2014 still necessitates a degree of complexity.\n\nFear not, Web3-projects-looking-to-incentivize-Uniswap-V3-liquidity. A variety of teams are hard at work building solutions to simplify this process. Naturally, the team building xToken Terminal believes we\u2019ve built the most secure, complete and powerful solution. However, we\u2019ll still run through all the options that are out there in order to provide  you with the most complete set of information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A basic summary of the feature sets for different Uniswap V3 liquidity mining options](https://preview.redd.it/5cv65tjvrzr81.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec6a9825c91db01f784b78abeb7cb080f806e5db)\n\n## xToken Terminal\n\nTerminal is our new capital markets platform, designed to provide DeFi/NFT projects \u2014 and whoever else! \u2014 seamless and permissionless access to fundamental on-chain primitives. The first of these primitives is Uniswap V3 liquidity mining. Via Terminal, a Web3 project can have a [Uni V3 LM program up and running in a few minutes](https://docs.xtokenterminal.io/terminal/mining/create-pool). No dev work or Uniswap expertise required.\n\nPool sponsors select a liquidity pool and price range to incentivize, one or more rewards token(s) to pay out to LPs and an optional vesting period on rewards. Once the liquidity/rewards pool is deployed, sponsors can initiate a rewards program for any amount over any period. Once a rewards program ends, sponsors can initialize a new one. Sponsors never need to leave the Terminal UI.\n\nSimilarly, LPs never need to leave the Terminal UI. LPs do not need to mint an NFT position (the sponsor mints a communal NFT on pool deployment) or navigate to alternative UIs to deposit liquidity pool tokens. Data on staked balances, APR, pool history, etc are all generated permissionlessly and viewable on the Terminal interface.\n\nTerminal is available on L1, Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0uail3kzrzr81.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=edce17de706c4afe0eb3d1954929c7bff59deca0\n\n## Gelato (G-Uni)\n\nSimilarly to Terminal, Gelato also provides a fungible interface for a non-fungible Uniswap V3 liquidity position. While Gelato does not actively rebalance liquidity positioning, the protocol provides a  manager role on their contracts that allows a representative of a project to actively re-position if desired.\n\nGelato/G-Uni does not provide any infrastructure for staking rewards, rewards  vesting or rewards data. Projects using G-Uni tokens for liquidity  mining will need to deploy/configure smart contracts and build a custom frontend.\n\n## UniswapV3Staker\n\nThe UniswapV3Staker contract is the most \u201cnative\u201d option available to projects looking to sponsor a liquidity mining program. The contract requires LPs to mint a Uni V3 NFT position and then deposit it. Rewards are paid out as a function of in-range liquidity, i.e. the more trading volume your position helps generate, the more rewards you will earn. This approach may be the most rooted in precision, but in practice it has been [marred by manipulation](https://medium.com/@revert_finance/onetickdao-eth-and-the-narrow-rangers-f9a376f7f0c9) as well as a bevy of UX challenges. It also requires deep Uniswap V3 knowledge to fully understand. Lastly, we\u2019re not aware of a full-feature UI for projects that wish to use the UniswapV3Staker contract.\n\nSome community members have proposed a few modifications to the contract \u2014 notably a change that requires LPs to cover a minimum price tick range. This change is likely to mitigate some or all of the issues related to manipulation of rewards, however, it is unlikely to allay any UX challenges.\n\n## Charm\n\nCharm\u2019s Alpha vaults rely on some of the most clever Uniswap V3 liquidity management logic that can be found in the space. Charm\u2019s vaults rebalance in a way that avoids a direct swapping of assets, instead relying on single-sided pseudo-limit orders \u2014 a Uniswap V3 hallmark.\n\n>Sidenote: many Uni V3 liquidity managers underestimate the slippage costs and gas costs of active rebalancing strategies, thus overestimating the expected value of a rebalance. Maximizing capital efficiency at a given moment does not necessarily lead to maximization of value.\n\nCharm is soon to release a permissionless version of their vaults (Alpha  Pro). It remains to be seen whether their approach, which is well-tested and successful on high liquidity pairs like ETH<>USDC, will be performant \u2014 programmatically or otherwise \u2014 on long tail pools.\n\nAt launch, Alpha Pro will not offer the smart contract or user interface architecture for native liquidity mining.\n\n## Gamma\n\nGamma pursues a more active rebalancing strategy, relying at least partially on off-chain logic that is not transparent to LPs. Though decentralization advocates may protest, there may be something to be  said for this more obscured approach, as purely on-chain rebalance strategies may be vulnerable to front-running or other forms of value extraction. Gamma is in the midst of remodeling their approach to liquidity management, so some elements of this description may no longer be accurate.\n\nGamma pools are not permissionless and there is no native liquidity mining architecture.\n\n# A Note on Rebalancing\n\nWe at xToken have been demo-ing our new platform for a variety of projects in the space. We\u2019ve been excited by the positive feedback we\u2019ve received on the platform\u2019s ease-of-use, configurability and  extensibility.\n\nSeveral projects have asked us why we don\u2019t offer the ability to rebalance  positioning in a pool. As the product currently operates, pool sponsors must set a price range at deployment and are unable to modify that price range (although deploying a new pool with new price range takes only a few minutes). While we are exploring methods of introducing this functionality, we believe that offering a rebalance feature on a permissionless platform like ours could expose our users to frontrunning and other forms of value extraction.\n\nWhy is that? We have experience with Uni V3 repositioning from our time managing [xU3LP](https://medium.com/xtoken/introducing-xu3lp-fungible-yield-f151c747131b), which for several months, was the largest provider of managed Uniswap V3 liquidity. It turns out that rebalancing must be executed very carefully, especially when the position in question is responsible for the lion\u2019s share of liquidity on the Uniswap pair (this concentration of pool ownership is likely the case for many LM programs). In carefully researching management strategies for xU3LP, we witnessed many instances of LP rebalances being front-run by bots on-chain. In short, rebalancing large Uniswap V3 positions requires a level of expertise and sophistication uncommon in the space.\n\n# Get in Touch\n\nInterested in learning more about xToken Terminal?

Besides that, the issuance of new ETH is decreasing and, alongside with the burning mechanism, Ether will be a deflationary crypto soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, I'd like to know what are going to be the advantages of maintaining infrastructure to be a ETH PoS Validator, because from the top of my head, with that information, I can only think that it would be a lot less money than the miners do. Of course I know hardware requirements would be very  different (and cheaper). But why wouldn't a miner just migrate his gear to, say, ETC?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess my whole point is: With Ethereum becoming deflationary, lowering fees and all, what should a potential validator expect from joining the network?",

[The Sandbox ](https://www.sandbox.game/en/?__cf_chl_tk=WO8LE2tkeidqfB_qt6SSTC_QqQk6fTKaVZ_v4fxU0bs-1649078435-0-gaNycGzNB9E)and [Ethermon](https://ethermon.io/) are two examples. Some of them are not pay-to-earn, but rather play-to-earn, and some of them have implemented an NFT rental, as [Wrejects](https://wrejects.com/) does. I\u2019m hoping that every year, all of the games will continue to improve and make better P2E games that we can actually enjoy while earning money. I\u2019m still looking forward to all of the upcoming games this 2022 and better game updates.  \n\n\nDo you still have hope that P2Es will continue to be better?",

Nothing else impacts gas price. \n\nSo, if people are ready to pay with current gas price for more transactions than 15M within a block, they do, because it's an auction. If so, gas price increases, until people don't want to pay for such gas price anymore, in which case gas price decreases. That's why it's self-regulated. \n\nOf course, when I say people, it's about all Ethereum users. Yet some users are ready to pay for way more than others. It results in some users getting stranded until gas price decreases, for their use cases doesn't justify for themselves to make transactions with such gas prices. We've historically seen this with big NFT minters and, years ago, with cryptokitty players. \n\nThe gas price may probably skyrocket, but it would be due to hype, not directly due to ETH price. Though ETH price increases has historically been tied to hype, it's a correlation, not a causation. Most probably, hype is the cause of both gas price increases (due to increased number of transactions) and ETH price increases (due to increased volumes bought by market takers on exchanges). \n\nIt is expected there will be some hype, so maybe using an L2 now probably is for the best. That or using a centralized exchange, with different risks tied to such choice (there will be risks anyway, though, just not the same ones).",

Many people here probably have some unsolicited tokens sitting in their wallets, and whenever someone asks what to do with them, the chorus always sings \"Do NOT touch it or it will empty your wallet!\" Ok, it's a reasonable advice, but anyone has yet to explain how exactly a smart contract can empty someone's wallet. \n\nI have a modest experience writing smart contracts, including ERC-20 smart contracts (creating my own tokens just for fun). I also have some experience interacting  with MetaMask from a webpage via JavaScript. So, I know how a user can be scammed into approving access to their tokens and then having their wallets emptied. It's still a long shot, though, since the user needs to be completely clueless and just hit \"approve\" button without reading what it is they're approving. Obviously, this method would require luring a user to your sinister Web3-enabled website first. \n\nHowever, if we strictly talk about smart contracts and specifically ERC-20 contracts, can someone explain how calling their functions like \"transfer\" or \"approve\" can give them access to your other tokens that are not managed by these contracts? For example, if I find some sh\u0456tco\u0456ns sitting in my wallet and want to send them to another address via MetaMask, how would it compromise my other tokens? Thanks!",

I've basically been assigned this task and have no help from within, so I'm turning to you for some help. Their idea is to be able to create one NFT for each user and one NFT for each device, and link the device to the user. I'm not certain this is the right way forward, but essentially they want an unassailable record of which devices are assigned to which users, and to assign a unique identifier to each user and device. My initial thinking is that since this is going to be a private blockchain and we have limited computing resources for this, it doesn't make much sense to do proof of work/proof of stake internally - it might be best to use clique for a proof of authority solution here. But I'm finding myself questioning whether ethereum and NFTs are really the right solution for this problem. Can anyone chime in with some thoughts on this?",

Researching to understand a project structure takes time and necessitates some skills in crypto and blockchain in general. My questions are the following:\n1. People with a good understanding of the crypto market, would you like to be paid for your time and work of creating a DYOR for other people?\n2. Newbies in the crypto space... would you pay for market research from a person with some background in crypto that is explained to anyone.\n\nI know too many people who invest without doing the proper research,  and I don't think there is a way to change people's behavior...

And you don't know anymore who owns what among them.\n\nThe extreme point of that is if you're suddenly having to follow literally every active wallets. \n\nSo, yeah, you could try and see where the tokens go, but, unless if the user is stupid and merge his tokens afterwards, it's not public anymore. \n\nFor instance, you could have most of it just sitting there, a bit of it going to an exchange and getting sold for fiat, another part being staked, yet another part being lended. And you have no way to know which part is which. Some are from the person you're tracking, most aren't. The more people are in the round, the harder it gets to track anything. It's not even a problem of tracking capacity: you could track everyone, but you can't know if it's them or not, just as if you didn't track them using that data, because that data is becoming less and less relevant.",

Wait a year or two and you could get a computer twice as good for the same money, or spend half as much for the same computer. This should have been a real drag on the industry.\n\nBut instead, the industry grew at an incredibly rapid pace, because people didn't just look to the future, they also looked to the past and thought \"wow, this cost $X a year ago and now it costs half that!\" or \"Wow, for my budget I can get a faster CPU and twice as much ram and storage as last summer!\" \n\nIn terms of motivation, this isn't different from general currency inflation. There were things you couldn't afford, now you can afford them, heck with waiting.\n\nDeflation is bad when it's *debt deflation*. Fiat currency is based on debt, so the currency supply shrinks when people are too far in debt, stop taking on new debt, and default on old debts more often. Then you do have a deflationary spiral, because the more valuable currency makes the debt even harder to pay off.",

Despite the massive adoption of altcoins, shitcoins remain on the market, posing a risk to the crypto community since regular investors purchase them and subsequently dilute their positions with fomo when the market is bearish or afraid.\n\nMaybe it's because I'm enamoured with well-known businesses promoting meme currencies. The market, in my opinion, has reached saturation. And you should have bought some valuable coins early on to take advantage of the bull market while avoiding the bear market.\n\nWhile some cryptocurrencies address real-world issues, others, such as doge and shiba (meme coins), have a large market and are still being purchased. If this trend continues, I feel the crypto community should be concerned, as it is stifling actual adoption.\n\nYes. Bitcoin mining consumes a lot more energy than the present financial system does. The Chinese Communist Party has forbidden the usage of Bitcoin in order to promote their own CBDC and keep control over their people, and as a result, their miners are relocating to nations with low electricity prices.\n\nIn contrast to China's principal energy source, coal, green energy sources such as hydropower, wind, solar, and geothermal are implicated.\n\n Mining will most likely occur when energy sources are \"stranded,\" that is, regions that are conducive to green energy generation but are too far away from population centres to be transferred.\n\nThese are only a handful of the problems that cryptography can solve. Bob Eco Coin, for example, is an initiative that addresses Africa's job difficulties. Or something like brave browser, which helps with privacy worries, or even xrp, which helps with money issues.\n\nThe options are limitless.

What industry do you think is powering crypto mining?\n\nThe truth is, we should be concerned about the environmental impact of **every** industry. You can't demand that only the good parts of crypto be taken seriously and dismiss any of the negative externalities. That kind of bullshit is why so many non-crypto folks roll their eyes about crypto. It comes across as bullshit when the crypto community says crypto is going to change the world, rework the entire nature of money and finance, destroy the entire banking industry, bring financial freedom to billions, yet somehow have absolutely zero negative consequences. There's always some negatives that come along with progress, and when we pretend there aren't we come off as cultists with our heads in the sand.",

I know Ledger offers ETH staking using Lido, but in order for it to make sense financially to me, I would have to stack my entire stack (even though it\u2019s not that big a stack). My concern is the reliability and how safe the Lido staking service is. If I stake my entire stack and something happens, I\u2019ve lost all my ETH. Is Lido safe and would you stake all your ETH in it to get the returns? Or should I wait until it\u2019s to been battle-tested and the bugs are worked out. I could also earn interest in DeFi too, but those are risky at the moment as well. Just looking for some opinions. I see the amount of ETH being staked on Lido now and it makes me feel more confident, but again, I don\u2019t want to lose all my ETH so I\u2019m very hesitant. What do you guys think?",

Please read the disclaimer, guidelines, and rules before participating.**\n\nRules:\n\n* All [sub rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethereum/about/rules/) apply in this thread.\n* Discussion topics must be related to Ethereum.\n* Behave with civility and politeness. Do not use offensive, racist or homophobic language.\n* Comments will be sorted by newest first.\n\nUseful Links:\n\n* [Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org)\n* [ETHHub](https://ethhub.io/)\n* [ETHMerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/)\n\n**Reminder**\n\n/r/ethereum is a community for discussing the technology, news, applications and community of Ethereum. **Discussion of the Ether price or trading is not allowed.** Please keep those discussions to [/r/ethfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance) and [/r/ethstaker](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**\n\nThere are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.\n\n**When is Eth2 launching?**\n\nEth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. \"The Merge\", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.\n\nVisit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about \"The Merge\".\n\n**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**\n\nNo, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.\n\n**How can I stake my ETH?**\n\nThere are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.\n\n* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details\n* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)\n\n**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**\n\nLike most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.\n\n**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**\n\nEthereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.\n\nAdditionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.\n\nWhile rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.\n\n**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**\n\nThe most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre there questions you'd like to see added? Leave a comment below.",

That could be ok to some people, but when the person doesn't feel secure even at home (it could happen for a sort of reasons, local government threats, familiar distrust, natural disaster possibilities, etc), storing it at home could be high risk.\n\nSo I'm wondering if there's a security way to store seed phrases and being able to access it from anywhere without a necessity to transport a physical paper with it.\n\nThe first thought could be storing it in a cloud, but it also might be very insecure, although in some cases storing at home could be even more.\n\nI'm thinking if a mixed storing would be a good choice, per example, splitting the seed phrase among two or three different clouds. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestion or opinion?",

That could be ok to some people, but when the person doesn't feel secure even at home (it could happen for a sort of reasons, local government threats, familiar distrust, natural disaster possibilities, etc), storing it at home could be high risk.\n\nSo I'm wondering if there's a security way to store seed phrases and being able to access it from anywhere without a necessity to transport a physical paper with it.\n\nThe first thought could be storing it in a cloud, but it also might be very insecure, although in some cases storing at home could be even more.\n\nI'm thinking if a mixed storing would be a good choice, per example, splitting the seed phrase among two or three different clouds. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestion or opinion?",

Then stored that somewhere online only they could access, and commit the book's name and version to memory..\n\nWithout knowing which book, its still really hard to reconstruct the phrase.\n\nI'm not recommending this approach, but it seems like a kinda neat idea.\n\nAnother, is Vitalik himself talking about it on one of Lex's podcasts. Half of his phrase was at home, the other have on his person. He called his mother to read out the half from home, and reconstructed it with the piece he had in person. He spoke about some other \"mathematical operations\" maybe there was some other mapping on top of that.\n\nEDIT: Here's Vitalik's piece.

Everyone else on the network is already a few blocks ahead of him, because they had more hashpower to find several blocks while the one miner found one valid block, and by law the longest chain is valid.

One second your wallet is connected to the PoW network, the next it's connected to the PoS network.\n\n> Will you have both old and new ETH in your wallet?\n\nIt's less that you'll have old and new ETH in your wallet, more that there will be two entire separate Ethereum networks for the briefest of moments. Your ETH exists in both networks at the same time, as both networks originated from the same history, but you'll only see one network, as your wallet will (hopefully) seamlessly switch from the old network to the new network.\n\n> If a few people keep the old fork running, does your ETH hold value in both forks?\n\nThe new network's ETH will hold the same value as before, as exchanges will also be seamlessly switching from the old network to the new network, but the old network's ETH will start losing value, as it's not listed on exchanges (yet, it may be listed if the old network survives the fork), and so nobody's trading it.\n\nThe same thing happened to ETC, which itself was born of a fork: the network hard forked, creating two separate versions; exchanges followed the new version, so the ETH listing updated to the new version, meanwhile the old version wasn't listed and so the price started to plummet; the old version was listed again under ETC, but by the time it was listed, the damage was done and it was a fraction of the price of ETH.\n\nSince then, ETC has been following its own pricing trajectory, as for all intents and purposes, it's a different coin to ETH, following the fork. If the PoW network survives the merge and miners/users get it listed on exchanges, then it'll likely go through the same process as ETC.\n\n> What if it does, can you still sell it?\n\nIf it gets listed on exchanges, yes. As said above, though, its price *will* diverge from ETH, so you may not make as much money selling it as you'd think/hope. Until it gets listed on exchanges, then you can only sell it P2P: directly trading it for some other coin or fiat with somebody else.\n\n> Do you have to make a new wallet?\n\nAssuming it survives the fork, then your wallet software would just need to be updated to list it as a new coin, and point to the old network. It *is* Ethereum at its core, it's just a version of Ethereum that took a different trajectory than the main Ethereum network, so your wallet will support it easily, and you'll even be able to keep the same address.\n*****\nIf you need a visual aid to help understand, [this](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Infographic-EthereumForks-Share-1-1000x600.jpg) is a decent illustration of what's going on, [as is this](https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/9VwG87pHVAvA2d2KuDGl0lXRPpg=/5751x2501/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/HardForkBlockchain3-6f5d8ce52f8a4dcba1137264e0d6c2d6.png).",

Without the difficulty bomb, you could have a situation where the miners simply refuse to upgrade, for example, they might claim that PoS is not ready or insufficiently tested and use such justifications to delay the transition indefinitely. In doing this they would have the benefit of inertia bias. The difficulty bomb ensures that a fork _has to_ happen to keep the chain running, so if miners want to maintain a PoW fork they will need to build support for it rather than relying on incumbency/inertia bias.\n\nOnce miners are gone, there is no future change envisaged that would naturally be opposed by the block producers/validators, so there will be no need to force a change on some timescale (which as we have seen is quite disruptive and not desirable from a development perspective).",

Short of Ethereum itself going down and deleting all data, everything stored in Arbitrum (except smart contract code, as far as I know) can be recreated, so you should be safe from a worst-case-scenario like that.\n\nThat basically leaves censorship and the actual sequencer node (the Arbitrum node responsible for committing transaction batches from the rollup to the Ethereum network) going offline, bringing transaction processing to a halt. For censorship, I believe Arbitrum has mechanisms in place to force transactions through from the Ethereum network, though unfortunately I don't think Arbitrum has any recourse for the sequencer node fully going offline.",

Otherwise just let it build up on kraken / another exchange until you can withdraw enough to make it worth your while. FTX also let's you withdraw straight to arbitrum.\n\nI'd also recommend getting a hard wallet, but again if it's \u20ac50 per month I'd really just recommend leaving it on an exchange for now.\n\nYou can also just withdraw to Arbitrum and bridge it to another L2 if you don't want to keep it there, fees aren't going to be huge, but could be a few euro which would eat into your stake, so again, I'd probably just let it build up a bit if I were you.",

The piece, titled, \"The roads not taken,\" is technical in places, but the main conclusions are easy to grasp.\n\nEthereum today has resulted from previous choices, decisions that were constrained by resources and \u201cbrain cycles\u201d and implementations where sometimes it was worth waiting for perfect and other times when good enough sufficed. \n\n\u201cIn general, it sometimes feels to me like Ethereum's biggest challenges come from balancing between two visions \u2013 a pure and simple blockchain that values safety and simplicity, and a highly performant and functional platform for building advanced applications,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nThe man knows what he\u2019s doing. This too is the case for the Metaverse and the many installations within it like Suku world that uphold these regimens. Some complexity in technicality is necessary and works for the favor of the projects themselves, and makes it look even simpler the user on the market. \n\nTake the case of the automatic transmission. When it first came out, it was frowned upon for it complexity in construction, but it still gave the user the most relaxed experience, and this is why it stuck with us. \n\nEthereum initially wanted to become the \u201cworld computer,\u201d or a decentralized platform, powered by cryptocurrency to execute any conceivable application. Today, Ethereum supports a multibillion-dollar economy, attracts some of the world\u2019s smartest computer scientists and is the wellspring from which a number of novel computer \u201cprimitives\u201d surface.\n\n\nEthereum is often criticized within the crypto industry, especially by bitcoiners, for its hierarchy of developers. There are certainly people and organizations with sway over Ethereum, but the network is arguably democratic. Or, at the very least, its oligopoly exists in the open.",

The way our society/economy/politics work is a lot like nature. The trouble with our political/economic systems is that many new laws/currency are added in but very very few are taken out (die) (In nature if a thing is continuously created and doesn\u2019t die, it over consumes itself/environment).\n\nCrypto is great because it allows value to be captured and distributed to its shareholders seamlessly and even transferred to a different system of governance if you lose interest in the previous coins governance system and applications. \n\nThis will continue pushing forward better and better systems of governance that attract users by offering increasingly better utility.\n\nIn turn this will leave our current political/economic system into the stone-age and bring a new era of increasingly improving governance systems that make US the people more happy (captured value distributed properly)\n\nThoughts on this?",

This included PoS (more efficient network), data sharding (more scalable data storage for the network) and execution sharding (more scalable transaction processing for the network).\n\nThat *original* original roadmap was scrapped in late 2020 and replaced with a new roadmap that was L2-centric, which entailed scrapping execution sharding and settling for only data sharding in the long term, with the option to reevaluate execution sharding at a later date, as well as focusing on the transition to PoS in the short term. Under this new L2-centric roadmap, the main network would be merged in with the new network as soon as possible, and L2s would be supercharged by sharding.\n\nThis new L2-centric roadmap was then iterated upon from then, to end up where it is now. Execution sharding has been abandoned for the foreseeable future, data sharding has been fleshed out more, statelessness and state/history expiry has become part of the roadmap to make the L1 network more lightweight, and more. Everything will happen in incremental steps, rather than as just one giant upgrade, like the *original* original roadmap would have brought.\n\nThe \"Ethereum 2.0\" terminology originated from the *original* original roadmap, as, for all intents and purposes, it *was* an Ethereum 2.0. Everything would still exist as it did under the original Ethereum, but all the improvements would come as one massive upgrade. People stuck to this idea, and as the roadmap updated to become more incremental in nature, this idea gradually became more and more incorrect, leading to people being confused over what would actually be coming.",

ETH that is on the now consensus layer chain will remain stuck there.\n\nA few months after the merge will come the Shanghai hard fork, which will implement a number of PoS improvements, one of which is stake withdrawals. Withdrawing your stake essentially involves moving that ETH from the consensus layer chain back to the execution layer chain, where it can now be used in the rest of the Ethereum ecosystem.",

What you're referring to is the series of EIP's that will be introduced afterwards to help the overcomplicated mess of a network scale in various ways so it can be a more efficient orgy of swaps, wraps, burns, mints, and stakes, run by dapps that do nothing but optimize token interactions to keep the orgy going. Thank god something besides stablecoins (85% of all ETH volume) has established itself as money and understands simplicity is a fundamental security practice.

Just to skim a few well known ones - Maker and AAVE are lending and borrowing platforms, Curve, Balancer and UniSwap are decentralized exchanges, Synthetix is a synthetics trading platform and dYdX is a perpetuals trading platform.\n\nI think a great example of the possibilities of DeFi is Alchemix - this dApp lets you deposit ether or DAI, borrow a fraction of it back and then the interest earned on your deposit is used to pay back the loan so you don't have to... this means that you can effectively save and spend with the same assets, which is pretty cool.\n\nAll that above is just looking at DeFi, one aspect of the Ethereum ecosystem.",

No host = no image/ audio. So they trying to patent a \"host\" hahahahaha. \n\nSecondly, people have added audio to images since forever. What are they trying to patent? Just because the audio may be owner only. None of this is proprietary. Anyone can do this with their own images and audio, steganography is fair use and anyone can do it.\n\nLastly, just shows the amount of greed and ignorance. Anything to try to make a dollar or build hype. My best bet is a lawyer laughed to their face when they even mentioned something like patenting this. \n\n\nYou can patent your own audio and images but that's as far as you'll get. Trying to patent something that doesn't actually exist on blockchain.... good luck with that! Hahahahaha.\n\nCan't wait for some lawsuits in this space to see what the precedence becomes.",

Some of the applications it supports have the goal of \"be pure money\" and those should in turn focus on those goals.",

Bitcoin's simple nature is also its greatest strength. \n\nNow does that mean Eth is bad or some how worth less than bicoin. Not necessarily. It was made with different utilites in mind. Bitcoin works as a store of value, eth works as a utility to provide faster transactions and layer 2s while giving up a bit of the security.\n\nThey both serve a purpose. Being a maximalist means to find what you truly value in both personal liberties and monetary necessaties. It doesnt mean find one coin and disregard the others.  \n\nReading through both bitcoin and eth subs they both provide toxicity of declaring the other to be maximialists. It doesnt have to be that way, and quite frankly bitcoin doesnt care what people think its a simple elqueant forumla.

Instead of having ridiculous charts and just being Mr. Uber Bull, I wanna give a real life rundown of my experience and thoughts.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m 38 and I work in finance. I  work with about 100 people both inside and outside of the company day to day. The average client I interact with has somewhere between half million-$3 million in net worth. Not rich, but not poor. The average age for this person is between 42-50 years old -so retirement savings should be a focus but not necessarily the primary one. income ranges around 120-300k.\n\nAdditionally, there is a group of about 30 people I work with who have a net worth between zero and 100K With an average age of 24 to 40. Income ranges from 70k to 180 K per year.Quick reminder, I work with about 130 people.\n\n3 own eth\n\nOnly one person has more than 100 K in crypto-total\n\nOnly 2 have more than three eth.\n\nOne has a basic understanding of the network.\n\nOf the two people I know that had significant crypto holdings, most was held In Gbtc and Ethe. the pain was simply too much And these people have gone down from big positions to 10% net worth.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this post, let me give you some advice that I learned from sidelines.\n\nOne of the people who has a ton of money and sold off a lot said \u201cI will sell it as it goes down but then I will rejoin if the tide turns\u201d.\n\nWell I am not a trader, I will say this: Conviction for 30 years down the road is a lot more important than you realize.\u00a0\n\nIf you sell, do not think you have a chance of re-buying it back.

Finally, an API platform with a refined UX (who doesn't like this?) and capabilities like no other. Now, users can either be end point consumers or node providers within the same platform. What I loved about this announcement is that node provides can join in governance of the ecosystem and be part of making future improvements and strategies, which is so unlike many projects. \n\nWith both a free and Subscription based plan that includes a customized plan, I want to believe this could be the future of API decentralization in web 3.0.\n\nI want to try to make an NFT using the platform just to test it :).

OBFC takes bank details, such as ABA routing numbers, IBANs, and other bank codes in the form of a standardized unique OBFC code, which is used as input for a blockchain transaction to facilitate a token transfer, which corresponds to an outgoing electronic bank transfer.\n\n**Things You Can Do With OBFC:**\n\n\u00b7 Send a wire transfer to a friend via your Ledger.\n\n\u00b7 Offramp USDC to $$$ directly from MetaMask.\n\n\u00b7 Pay your rent on Ethereum by using OBFC to wire money to your landlord!\n\n**Give us feedback!!**\n\nCheck out the app, at [obfc.finance](https://obfc.finance/)\n\nWe are at a really early stage in developing this system, so if you are interested in helping us or giving us initial feedback please do reach out.\n\nWe think this is a pretty interesting example of how you can use Ethereum to interact with traditional banking infrastructure.\n\nPlease be advised, this is highly experimental right now and you should reach out to us if you are interested in trying it out. (read the [transparency](https://forum.obfc.finance/c/transparency/5) tab for more information).\n\nThank you,\n\nTeam OBFC",

This will be fun:\n\n> Unburnt fees (aka tips) on the execution layer (EL) begin going each block's proposer - completely liquid on the EL. Over a typical week, this is ~14k ETH / $42mm\n\nOn the Ethereum network, sometimes blocks are full.  To create a mechanism so that high priority blocks can always get through, there is a tip mechanism.  Currently, those tips go to miners.  After the merge, the tips will go to stakers, which, by many estimates, could double the returns on staking from current values.  This could cause a huge demand for staking (and therefore ETH), both because of this additional return and because of removing one of the big risk factors for Ethereum (the transition to Proof of Stake).\n\n> Due to the amount of work required to properly test and verify the Merge across all clients, Beacon Chain validator withdrawals of staked ETH are only expected to be included in the upgrade after (Shanghai). Work from @ralexstokes has started here\n\nRight now, the people who are staking on Ethereum cannot access their earned ETH.  This will not change immediately after the merge, it will require another upgrade, probably 6-12 months after the merge.\n\n> Post-merge, blocks will arrive exactly every 12s. Today, they arrive in a poisson distribution around ~13s. For devs: do not assume ~13s blocktimes (eg. to calculate an interest rate) - please make sure to use timestamps.

Smaller block/ slot times do increase available blockspace, but not significantly. Av. blockspace is only one input which influences fees, the other being demand. Near-term scaling & lower fees will be on Layer 2s!\n\nIt will still be expensive to run on the Ethereum main net after the merge.  Additional chains, called \"level 2\", are the future of cheap transactions, with many of them basically instantaneous (instead of 12 or 13 seconds) and transaction costs in the pennies (instead of tens of dollars).\n\n> To any stakers: you should start running a local execution layer (EL) client ahead of the Merge. In the future, outsourcing this to third-party providers will open up stakers to slashing risk under the Proof of Custody game\n\nThere are two parts to running a validator.  You need to build blocks (execution layer, or EL), and you need to validate blocks.  Currently, since the two are separate, you can basically outsource the EL to others.  After the merge, this will no longer be possible, and stakers will have to run both parts themselves.\n\n> The Merge will use accumulated difficulty (Total Terminal Difficulty) to trigger the PoW\u2192PoS upgrade, instead of block height \"An attacker cld use a minority of hash power to build a malicious chain fork that wld satisfy the block height req\". more here\n\nThey are using a different method to kick off the merged chain as compared to previous upgrades, due to complicated technical issues.\n\n> At the Merge, the 2 ETH PoW block reward goes away. new issuance will only come from PoS validators proposing blocks (~.025 ETH) or \"attesting\" aka voting on network state (~.00002 ETH) 4.3% PoW issuance \u2192 .43% in PoS h/t @litocoen. Higher security w/ lower spend!\n\nThe amount of new ETH issued with each block will drop dramatically after the merge (some people are predicting decreased supply for a while).  This means that existing ETH should be worth more.\n\n> Running a node post-Merge does not require any ETH (and never has). This is an important part of Ethereum culture that should be accessible to all. (Staking independently - aka consensus activities - does require 32 ETH. With some providers, it may be lower than 32.\n\nYou can still run parts of the clients without actually staking any ETH, but you will not get any reward (except knowing that you are helping to strengthen the network).",

                                            "response": "Here's some terminology, ELI12 style!\n\n> Unburnt fees \n\nUsers of Ethereum pay ETH to submit transactions (requests to do things) to the chain. These are fees. Most of the fees get burned (deleted from existence) by the chain.\n\n> (aka tips) \n\nThe fees that don't get burned are called \"tips\" and will be received by validators (people running nodes and staking a bunch of ETH) after the Merge.\n\n> The execution layer (EL) \n\nThe Merge brings together two halves of Ethereum, the Consensus Layer (which lets thousands of decentralized people agree on how to update the blockchain) and the Execution Layer (which handles all the logic for running people's transactions and keeping track of their ETH etc.)\n\n> Block's proposer\n\nBlockchains are made of blocks, which bundle together a bunch of transactions that the blockchain processed. Someone has to gather those transactions and propose, or suggest, a block with some of them in it. Proposing is a valuable duty because you can make money from various sources for doing so. In practice, validators are randomly assigned this duty.\n\n> Clients\n\nClients are the software people run to run nodes/validators on the Execution and Consensus layer. Unlike other blockchains which usually just have one client, Ethereum has many independently coded ones, because this leads to better decentralization and safety.\n\n> Staked ETH\n\nAs a reminder, to run a validator, you need to stake ETH (32 per validator). \"stake\" means that if you misbehave, you lose your ETH. Other chains call their inflation paid to coin holders \"staking\" but this is fake, because they have no mechanism to punish misbehavers. Their coins are never \"at stake\".\n\n> The upgrade after (Shanghai)\n\nEthereum has regular upgrades. The Merge (also called Bellatrix on the Consensus Layer and Paris on the Execution Layer) is the next upcoming upgrade. Capella/Shanghai is the upgrade after that one.\n\n> they arrive in a poisson distribution around ~13s\n\nRoughly speaking, a bell curve. Most are around 13s, a few are a lot faster, and a few are a lot slower.\n\n> Smaller block/ slot times do increase available blockspace\n\nIf you have your blocks more often, you can process more transactions (transactions take up \"blockspace\" depending on how complex they are).\n\n> blockspace is only one input which influences fees, the other being demand\n\nBlockspace is the limited resource (the \"supply\"), and as everyone knows, supply and demand determines prices of things, including fees! Ethereum is expensive to use because it has very high demand and only average supply of blockspace.\n\n> Layer 2s\n\nYou can think of these as sub-blockchains that get their security from Ethereum, but perform execution much much more efficiently. This means that their supply of blockspace is much higher, and hence fees can be much lower!\n\n> Accumulated difficulty (Total Terminal Difficulty) to trigger the PoW\u2192PoS upgrade\n\nUnder PoW (Proof of Work), miners are the ones proposing blocks. They all try to solve a math problem to gain the right to propose a block (remember, this is valuable). The more miners there are, the harder the math problem gets, to keep the chain running at the same rate. If you sum up how hard the math problems are over time, you get the \"total difficulty\". Sometimes a blockchain will fork into two versions, when nodes disagree over which version of events is correct, and PoW chains decide which one is correct by comparing the total difficulty of those forks. The one with the higher difficulty (the most people mining it) is the correct one. So using total difficulty to decide when to do The Merge means that it will be based off the chain with the most miners, i.e. the correct one.\n\n> Block height \n\nThis is just the total number of blocks ever produced on the chain.\n\n> Block reward \n\nThis is the amount of ETH that gets paid to miners when they propose a block. You get 2 ETH per block currently, in addition to tips.\n\n> New issuance\n\nNew ETH coins being created. Also known as \"inflation\". This doesn't create new value, but rather reduces the value of everyone's ETH by a little bit by making there be more ETH. Kinda like what just happened with USD over the past two years.\n\n> \"attesting\" aka voting on network state \n\nValidators all vote on what's happening on the blockchain, and the number of votes is similar to the difficulty in PoW - it lets you determine which version of the chain is the one \"preferred\" by most of the validators.\n\n> Higher security w/ lower spend!\n\nSecurity = how much it costs to attack the chain. With PoW, you need to buy enough hashrate to 51% attack the chain. You can do this for however long you can afford it, because the hashrate is just physical machines you're renting, and those exist longterm. With PoS, you need to buy enough coins to 66% attack the chain. This is absurdly expensive, and you will lose all of those ETH if you attack the chain, because the rest of us (all the normal people running the chain) will fork the chain to get rid of your attack, and get rid of all your ETH at the same time. So you will fail to achieve anything, and lose all your money. Higher security! Also lower spend, because that 2 ETH per block has gone away :)\n\n> Running a node post-Merge does not require any ETH (and never has). \n\n\"Node\" is different than \"validator\". A node is just software you run on a computer, which talks to other nodes on the network, and passes around messages for the network. The node will check every message to make sure everything follows the rules, and throws out any message that doesn't. This is great for the network, since it means only valid messages are propagated between peers (nodes on the network). A validator (formerly a miner) is the one proposing blocks and attesting to other people's blocks, and hence with some responsibility to decide which version of the chain is correct, and getting rewarded for doing so. You can run a node for free without proposing or attesting (but without rewards either). This really helps the network decentralize, and if you want to do it, you totally should!\n\n> With some providers, it may be lower than 32.\n\nYou can stake your ETH, even if it's much less than 32, via a variety of decentralized (RocketPool), semi-centralized, or centralized staking providers. Then someone else will actually run the nodes and validator on the chain, and you can just collect (most of) the profits.",

Or were people sure it was a great idea off the bat? \n\nIs there any projects currently you get the same vibe from?\n\nLoopring is currently my largest holding and I was wondering what the eth society thinks of it? I want an unbiased opinion really- i think its ridiculous when people say its gonna hit 100$ etc- like blatantly just hyping it up and hopium- but then i think eth went from 31cents to over 3k$ so is it even feasibly possible? the market cap would have to be like 130bil so i think its just mad cos ofc thats huge.\n\nMy main questions are how does the current climate of ceertain tokens match up with the original atmosphere of getting into eth? i understand crypto wasnt anywhere near as established back then but really its not that established now.",

As we\u2019ve seen in the past year, many other coins have grown dependent on ETH and have used its blockchain as part of their blockchain, notwithstanding all the positive effects it has had on the DeFi world. \n\nYou see, if it wasn\u2019t for the success of ETH, DeFi wouldn\u2019t exist even. It basically launched it into the Ether, literally. \n\nDeFi is huge right now, and it has never been this big before. The whole world has come to understand that DeFi is a need and a must. \nF\nDeFi expands the use of blockchain from simple value transfer to more complex financial services. Specifically, DeFi refers to an ecosystem of decentralized applications \u2013 autonomous applications that operate using smart contracts instead of relying on an underlying company to manage them.\n\nApparently, as reported by CoinDesk, some DeFi platforms allow you to pay off student loans even, other platforms like Aloha DeFi function as a gateway into the DeFi space, with NFTs and DAOs within providing win win situations for everyone. A decentralized world that is just getting started but carries much potential. \n\nRight now, one of the largest sectors within, and the current news item of all mass media, is GameFi, as more and more game companies try to branch out with DeFi to expand the gaming industry. \n\nThe success of ETH, pushes the success of DeFi, and DeFi is bound to change the world.",

Polygon alone announced $15 million allocated solely for DeFi development and liquidity mining on the chain. And we\u2019re seeing a lot more Ethereum based projects starting to follow suit as well.\n\nWhat\u2019s crazy is that DeFi is only getting started. It\u2019s what? 5 years old? That is NOTHING compared to other financial institutions that took decades and even centuries to see the similar growth that DeFi saw in a couple of years.\n\nThis might sounds like a reach right now, but if we keep up this pace financial institutions will slowly but surely start losing their grip around the populous\u2019 necks.",

With that number, the results are far from representative and probably wouldn't even justify a survey in a single state. No mention either as to how the survey was conducted. Was it online? In person? By phone? By mail? By fax? Maybe they sent smoke signals?\n\nThey don't even show the questionnaire, nor say if they restricted the percentage of respondents for each age range on par with the age distribution in America, and same goes for residence or sex. Were the respondents 50% male and 50% female, just as the sex distribution in America that you would expect for a \"national\" survey? No survey can be trusted if they don't specify how it was conducted. This is the equivalent of toilet paper and the veracity of the facts the same as propaganda.\n\nCarrying an actual national survey about any matter in a country as populated as the US is VERY expensive, which is why governments are usually the few ones taking this endeavour. Having a representative sample of your whole country involves interviewing many elders, and since not everyone uses the internet, big amounts of money go into financing door-to-door interviews. But of course, no mention of that in this study, which affirms to be national, whatever that means according to them.",

As stake increases, the costs of monitoring the validators also increases. Having a better computer & internet is probably a good expense.\n\nAlso, if you really have many validators, you will need to split them into different computers having different Internet access, so as to reduce your risks through redundancy: because risks increases greatly with the number of validators sharing the same risks due to how slash penalties are computed. It increases much more than economies of scale. So, to me, the economy of scale in PoS is highly debatable. There could very well be none at all or even a negative one.

But deploying a liquidity mining (LM) program on V3 right now requires technical expertise and development time - it typically requires 2-3 developer weeks.\n\nHow do we solve this? Enter,[ xToken Terminal](https://xtokenterminal.io/).\n\nTerminal is a permissionless, no-code platform that allows projects to configure and deploy V3 LM programs in a few easy clicks - with a rich UI, a configurable contract architecture, and powerful features like rewards vesting and multi-token incentives. Terminal is great for LPs as well, allowing frictionless liquidity deployment and an end-to-end experience.\n\n100% of fees collected from Terminal are redistributed to xToken (XTK) stakers. Single asset staking of XTK is available with a current APR of over 40%.\n\nTo learn more, check out our[ docs](https://docs.xtokenterminal.io/) or our [brief tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIgiWOzf6FE&t).

It is worth noting that the landmark figure was recorded barely 15 months after the Ethereum 2.0 staking initiative was launched. Despite Ethereums\u2019 contribution to the staking contract being inaccessible until the official launch of the 2.0 upgrade, contributors have continued to deposit large volumes of ETH. The reason for this commitment is large because stakers who make deposits to the staking contract will earn 4.81% in annual rewards.   \n\n\nThe contract was launched as part of an effort to transition ETH from a PoW mechanism to a PoS algorithm. ETH developers opted for the PoS algorithm over the PoW because the latter is associated with slower and more expensive transactions, with fees soaring above $250 per transaction on certain occasions. From my personal experience using KAIBA DeFi I would say that their application of the PoR consensus has proven to be a very good solution, so maybe it could be helpful here as well.  \n\n\nSo, what do you think about all of these?",

If you stop people in Europe having self custodial wallets, they can't mine privately as they cannot transfer coins from their self custodial wallet to exchange to pay for the electricity / hardware used to mine... This strangles supply immediately and sharply - Prices of cryptos will go through the roof.\n\nAs someone else stated: Unworkable.\n\nTrying to control what you cannot is not time well spent. The reason for this is because if states try to enforce AML (and waste time/resource doing that), they simply force solutions to be engineered that remove AML as a remote possibility. Cryptographic techniques today are far more robust and intelligent than 100% of politicians.\n\n[https://twitter.com/macro\\_diary/status/1508801511454920707](https://twitter.com/macro_diary/status/1508801511454920707) Byron @ Loopring has this right\n\nEDIT: Also AML rules in the EU mean nothing for the rest of the world. Certain jurisdictions outside the EU will have no AML requirements and since you can't prevent self-custodial/peer-to-peer transactions, the whole thing ends up being partial information/unstoppable.  \nAs a case in point about engineers/cryptographers (mathematicians) being way ahead of politicians on this stuff [https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/03/21/garbled.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/03/21/garbled.html) this caught my attention",

They actually just want to maintain control over the financial system and crypto scares the shit out of them.",

(Why even??.., It'll happening anyway, just in another country.\nWith the result being missing out on the potential tax income generated by those companies)\nThis preciously mentioned tx tax is also for cryptocurrencies, but ofc (almost?) no-one pays those for crypto. At least in in Belgium AFAIK.\n+ Capital gains tax in France I think, 0% in Belgium for long term investments though ;)",

At the moment, crypto is at a early period without any details of what an outcome will be for what lies ahead. There are many aspects about cryptocurrency that regulators should be trying to understand tactfully. Albeit these types of discussions are alarming, it is important to identify here, that the sentiment amongst the younger generations are promising and they are favoring the \"revolutionary myth of cryptocurrency\". So targeting cryptocurrency transers, imo, as an (if) statement, will have minimal impact in the growth of the space because as a whole, crypto is so much more than the sum of controversial agreements. The real challenge, as an individual, is recognizing the bigger trends that have already suggested mass acknowledgement of a \"crypto epoch\". Wagmi",

Crypto is not bad for the environment, this is the economy we are talking about here. Mining for gold is more harmful for nature than mining for Ethereum or Bitcoin.  Not only that, but now that ETH 2.0 is on track, the new update promises more efficiency and less harm for nature overall.   I think this is all virtue signalling anyway, these people aren't outside of crypto because it harms nature, they feel resentment for not being to join at a right time. Plus if they wanted to do something about, there are plenty of ways, within crypto to support, for example the GoMining Token makes mining more efficient and the Plastik token literally lays a token on every single use plastic, adding accountability into the mix.   We should all be accountable for the world we live in, especially in the current trend the world is moving in. The world will be moving into a world of shared responsibility and shared reward, and this is something we should all be getting used to.",

Indeed, I did learn some more aspects about the ongoing discussion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut then again...  \n\nThe elephant in the room was only very briefly touched when Justin mentioned (in his closing argument) that PoW comes with \"higher\" costs to secure the network. Really?\n\nThat was all?\n\nAnd even he gets it wrong (Sorry, Justin). He states that the network needs to pay for economic security with fees and issuance of new tokens and takes issuance as the main cost - which is true on-chain. New tokens dilute the value of existing ones.\n\nBut what is completely ignored are the effects these systems have off-chain (i.e. in the real world)! If you observe blockchains from an off-chain perspective, then for PoW the costs for economic security are matched by the immense ressource usage PoW is infamous for, while PoS has no real equivalent.\n\nBy saying PoW BTC costs almost 100 dollars a year to have 100 dollars of economic security while PoS needs only 5 dollars, he implies a 20x improvement. But if you take the outside perspective, the difference is even more striking.\n\nThe 100 dollars in PoW mean 100 dollars of power consumption or other investments. The 5 dollars a PoS system pays out are NOT \"backed\" by an equal cost in the real world, because the main entry barrier here is the staked capital.\n\nBut even this greater factor does not show the true nature of the one huge economic problem PoW has. \n\n(I am using BTC as a synonym, because that will be the only relevant blockchain in the near future)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those who are not that familiar with the topic:\n\nPoW is often criticized for \"high\" energy consumption, an estimated like 0.5% or 1% of the global power production is used to mine bitcoins. Bitcoiners will then argue that the value of the network is greater than this \"cost\".\n\nThis is entirely missing the point. The energy consumption of today or last year is completely irrelevant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me elaborate:\n\nThe DNA of PoW is to burn real world assets (read: power consumption + electronic waste) in order to receive a fraction of newly issued BTC.\n\nBecause these real world assets are priced in whatever fiat currency, the total incentive for all miners globally currently is 6.25 BTC \\* BTC price per 10 minutes - e.g. in USD roughly 42.3m USD per day (as of today). \n\nAs long as the total cost for running all mining rigs is significantly lower than this, miners will bring more rigs online. Someone in the world will do it, because it's profitable.\n\nAnd that means nothing less than that the global operational cost of the Bitcoin network (in fiat currency) scales directly proportional to the BTC price. \n\nIf the BTC maxis' wet dreams come true and BTC rises to a million dollars - guess what? The value of issuance of BTC in $ will grow by the same factor (20x !) as will the investments made by miners and thus power consumed by the network.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, in short: BTC will in the long run either not be successful or kill us all. I am not making a jest. \n\nIf BTC becomes the global success everyone hopes for, then what we see today is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is basic economics, no technological advance and no use of renewable energies can fix this. \n\nIf someone invents mining rigs that produce more hashrate per unit of energy, the miners will just run more hardware.\n\nIf there is cheaper power, miners will use more.\n\nAs for the usage of \"green\" energy - let us for one moment ignore that no one will be able to verify the claim that a certain percentage of renewables is used for bitcoin and that these power sources will not be available to de-carbonize industries elsewhere -\n\neven if you assume there is enough green energy to supply a multiple of BTC's energy consumption today (maybe a few more volcanos pop up in El Salvador), miners would spend their entire budget on hardware or something else that comes with real world costs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn a PoS network, the operational cost of running the network is not tied to the token price. So, if someone states that Ethereum's switch to PoS will reduce the energy need by 99,9% - this is also misleading and a massive understatement.\n\nThe switch to PoS will replace the energy need of the network by a fixed amount that is 99,9% lower than the current energy need!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo sum it up, any serious discussion about PoW vs PoS should at least include:\n\n1) which consensus mechanism will not kill us as a species?\n\n2) end of debate\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll these other aspects that have been discussed might be of academic interest and some might help to improve blockchains in the future, but they cannot seriously alter the outcome.",

The 5 dollars a PoS system pays out are NOT \"backed\" by an equal cost in the real world, because the main entry barrier here is the staked capital.\n\nIt's called an opportunity cost. You've allocated resources, here ETH, into the staking used by the consensus. It's resources you could have invested elsewhere. Actual resources. The fact you can't touch it doesn't mean it's not an actual resource.\n\n>So, in short: BTC will in the long run either not be successful or kill us all. I am not making a jest.\n\nHm, you're keeping an assumption that is true nowadays but would be false way before it kills us all. You're assuming burning electricity doesn't increase electricity price. It's true when you're only burning a small quantity of it. But once you end up burning more, you end up in an equilibrium where increases in electricity costs reduce the hashing power required to reach an equilibrium between mining profitability and electricity consumed. Just like staking, it's a self-regulated system. Although it has very strong consequences on the availability of electricity for the rest of the market. Just like the relations between fuel, bio fuel and food prices. An increased demand in fuel drives demand in bio fuel which decreases food availability for other purposes and results in starvation here and there.\n\nSo, it would affect us pretty badly, but would also drive innovation in cheap electricity production and wouldn't be able to kill us anyway. It would certainly kill some of use, though, as increasing energy price increases prices through the whole market and drives people into below minimum sustenance.\n\nBesides, it assumes BTC prices can go higher and higher indefinitely. This is also capped, even more so since miners need more and more of an influx of resources to buy and burn all that electricity. The higher the price, the harder it will become to proportionately increase it, both because any increment of a percent would need even more funds and because maintenance costs increase.\n\nThis goes the same for PoS, except that it uses ETH as a resource and will definitely drive innovation in ETH usage and won't have any impact on electricity production and availability.",

People who ignore long term externalities don't give a shit about the environmental cost.  Between a combination of private purchases of old plants and governments in economically distressed areas placing short term gain over long term sustainability, the real equilibrium level you posit is far off because coal isn't being taken out of the grid because of cost(it's cheap and abundant) or lack of availability(there's a surplus of coal powered generation).  The only way to stop this before too much harm is done is for the federal government to act to disincentivize this use of coal.",

The path of least resistance. The least effort is the one that offers better for cheaper.\n\nStop expecting the state to solve that problem. You're a responsible adult. Face reality: this decision has been taken by states in London more than a century ago and they won't stop it now, even more so with use of coercion. All states have followed suit. It was \"for the greater good\". Even if it was literally killing people back then near the Thames, it was still for the \"greater good\". After entire generations of politicians from all parties all around the world, if you're still expecting them to solve your problems for you, maybe you should reflect on why you're not trying to find an actual solution. Sorry to be harsh, here, but there's a reality to face and it's astonishing to observe people still believing the fairy tale of politicians.\n\nIf you want actual solutions and if coal is really that cheap, instead of wasting litteral money on politicians, buy the coal. Coal is a finite resource just as much as electricity. If it's so cheap, it will continue to be used for electricity, with or without PoW. So, gather funds and send it to someone who will buy the coal and sign a contract ensuring he would pay ten times more of that coal is ever burnt.\n\nThis way, you ensure coal isn't burnt, be it to produce electricity or in any other way. Peacefully. Cooperatively. Consentfully. Without waiting for politicians. Without requiring tons of money funneled into politicians for a megre results. Just with part of that money sent to buy the coal. Because let's face it, if there's money that is wasted, it's the money thrown at politicians as if it ever solved any problem. \n\nAnd then, once the rest of the coal becomes rare and expensive, coal will naturally stop being burnt for electricity, for it wouldn't be profitable anymore. Burning it for electricity would become a waste.",

I noticed that plenty of users prefer to use Solana and Avalanche as gas fees on all of these chains cost less than a dollar. ETH has less throughput also in comparison to other Layer 1 blockchains.   \n \n\nVarious scaling solutions can help in boosting the growth of ETH's ecosystem. But what I've heard is that the rollups have shown the most potential as a scaling solution out of all of these. They can solve significant problems for ETH users, which are high gas fees and less throughput.   \n \n\nI've noticed over time how rollups are enabling transactions at a low cost and have a high throughput capacity without compromising the security as settlement of all the transactions executed on rollups happens on ETH. ETH can act as a settlement layer of the ETH ecosystem while rollups are used as an execution layer.   \n \n\nYou know how processing is sluggish, optimistic rollups can boost scalability by up to 10-100x, depending on the transaction. With the advent of shard chains, this figure will rise even further, as more data will be available if a transaction is challenged. The two most widely used optimistic rollups are Optimism and Metis, which allows us to provide extraordinarily quick transactions that take only a few seconds and cost only a few cents while yet preserving ETH Layer 1 security.   \n \n\nWhat do you think of rollups?",

The term \"modular blockchain\" was originally termed by [Celestia](https://twitter.com/CelestiaOrg), and more recently, [polynya](https://twitter.com/epolynya). This means that you are focusing on using different technologies to create a better \"blockchain\".\n\nBlockchains consist of three core tasks:\n\n1. Execution- processing transactions (user experience).\n2. Security- keeping data secure on a chain (e.g. Bitcoin & Ethereum).\n3. Data Availability- Ability to query data/blobs from a chain.\n\nEthereum is the best chain for security. At the moment, it's not the best for DA (data availability)- generally sharded chains provide this functionality best, which Ethereum will offer in 12-18 months. For now it's a \"good solution\" for DA. Obv, Ethereum is awful for execution. It's slow and expensive!\n\nThis is where the \"Ethereum L2\" mindset comes into place for teams. Rollups, especially validity rollups (aka zkRollups) are the best when it comes to compressing data, similar to a .zip file.\n\nBy bringing in rollup solutions, whether it be zkSync, StarkNet, StarkEx, Optimism, Arbitrum, Boba, Loopring, Polygon, etc., this allows teams to have a modular mindset like this:\n\nExecution: Rollup\n\nSecurity: Ethereum\n\nData Availability: Ethereum\n\nObviously you can approach this in a different manner, and use other solutions for execution, security, or DA. It's up to you from the development standpoint on what you want to do.\n\nAre Rollups the best scaling solution? Not necessarily. They're just able to be used as an agnostic technology to help any L1 blockchain scale. L1s \\*can\\* scale blockchains effectively, but that might cause the chain to become worse for DA or Security.\n\nThis has been the mindset of our team at [Numio](https://www.numio.one/), who has been building around L2 for the last 2+ years.",

Once we move to Proof of Stake the issuance will drop to about 0.5 million new ether per year. For about 6 months stakers won't be able to sell anything so issuance will be effectively 0 for that period. We are also burning about 2.5 million ether per year in transaction fees, so for a while at least the asset will be deflationary. So how will that effect the price?

Every 4 years the amount of bitcoin issued per year halves. When the Merge occurs (not necessarily June, there is no official date) the amount of ether issued will not just halve but will drop by 90%. 3 halvings works out to about 89% so would be roughly the same.. however this doesn't take into account that: a) NO newly issued ether will be accessible until a hardfork is introduced to allow validators to withdraw their staked ether (probably about 6 months after The Merge); and b) we are burning base fees through EIP-1559 - currently about 4-5x more than would be issued to stakers.\n\nTriple halvening is very much underselling what's going to happen to the supply of ether.",

And practice a bit. Then, look for Robert Martin blog (and videos, if you can afford them, but his blog has most of the content, just in a less digest way).\n\nThere aren't much to know about programming, really. Several years aren't needed at all. Once you understand the basic concepts, programming languages are just flavors and specializations towards a goal or another. \n\nDon't bother your brain with language details you won't use, because it will just be useless clutter.

If you also want to understand how to manage a blockchain or an L2 (not fully required if you're only willing to manage some smart contracts, but desirable to understand what you're storing, how you're storing it and how you're retrieving it), you'll also need to delve into understanding databases and, more important to you, ledgers. \n\nBut as I said, instead of learning about languages only, focus on concepts, like polymorphism, duck-typing, inheritance, scope, accessibility levels, variables, classes, data structures and such (not in that order). And of course SOLID principles, as it's about how to architecture your code in a way that will help you implement it as well as maintain it over time. \n\nTry as much as possible to learn any language and tool you'd use that doesn't force you to keep using a given framework, like Angular or such. Frameworks are good, but it's also good to ensure you're not too much reliant on them, so that you can easily move beyond such framework as soon as it lags behind in its continuous improvements.

Now I just need to remember my password from 2017 for a wallet I created in mew for the JSON file.  and then figure out how to interact with contracts in ledger live.\n\n**So from what I can gather about the info I have saved\u2026 when starting an auction or bidding on an ENS name, 3 words were given as part of the transaction. I have those 3 words for one of the wallets but I am wondering if there is a way to use the raw transaction data from starting an auction and bidding to derive the password to unlock the wallet for other transactions.\n\n***still brute forcing the old wallet\u2026 Does capitalization matter in the password for the UTC json file?\n\n****alright so at this point I\u2019m trying the hardware wallet. My firmware is 1.2.4 on ledger nano s. I do not have blind signing in settings as an available option, only contract data and display data. \n\n\n*****un fucking believable.

For those reasons we are building with intention and at the speed of trust as we buildLaborDAO.\u00a0\n\nAs organizers, artists, activists, researchers, developers, labor lawyers and more, we understand the challenges of fundraising through traditional financing methods. We are fundraising in a decentralized manner because we are driven to support the everyday people who are most affected by labor issues.\n\nWe\u2019re working with artist [Billy Buntin](http://billybuntin.com/) to drop a series of LaborDAO NFTs that will serve as identification and help us airdrop to early contributors and supporters once the DAO is up and running. All contributors will receive access to the LaborDAO\u2019s private Discord chat channel that will be launched later in May.\n\nThe Top 3 Crowdfund contributors will receive one of three NFTs from Billy Buntin. His artwork has been designed to honor three groups of workers who have been severely impacted and organized through the pandemic: nurses, baristas and office workers.\n\n\\*\\*\\*LaborDAO DeFi Protocol\u00a0\\*\\*\\*\n\nWorkers have always suffered the brunt of the weight from financial crisis caused by the abuses of Wall Street.\n\nDeFi is a revolutionary tool that solves problems created by Traditional Finance (TradFi) and takes power from Wall Street putting it in the hands of ordinary people. There currently aren\u2019t any [Decentralized Finance (DeFi)](http://defipulse.com/) protocols that are using a share of their profits to support worker struggles. This is an incredibly important experiment that can tip the balance of power back to workers.\n\nWe intend to create a responsible DeFi project that reflects the most serious and respected projects in the Ethereum ecosystem. The protocol will allow users to grow funds while supporting the Labor Movement and will in turn allow workers to use DeFi as a sustainable source of revenue.\n\nA portion of the revenue generated by the protocol will be used to support our Solidarity Fund.\u00a0 That means that using our protocol, you will be funding workers who want to strike and organize.\n\nOur plan for the LaborDAO DeFi Protocol development goals include:\n\n1. Creating smart contracts, Treasury, [multi-sig wallets](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/10/multisignature-wallets-can-keep-your-coins-safer-if-you-use-them-right/) and more\n2. Hiring developers to build smart contracts for LaborDAO\n3. Research on existing lending protocols including AAVE, MakerDAO and Compound\n4. Create governance and delegate system\n\nThe crowdfund will end June 1, Wednesday at 3pm EST/ 1AM (UTC).",

Most crypto devs today are men working in emerging companies with big capital and marketing. But Loredana works mostly by herself to build great volumes of publicly available software for free.\n\nWe begin with the political and personal circumstances of her birth and childhood in Romania, and why she was motivated to cultivate self-reliance and independence from her parents, and direct access to truth. Then we talk about developing for Ethereum. She shares her philosophy for volunteer work, and her experience in contrast to the rest of the crypto space and culture. We talk about her work on the [Laurel project](https://laurel.provable.dev/): *\u201ca blockchain that tracks provable human effort (such as volunteering) as a non-transferable medal of merit, usable for governance, proof of effort, provable news etc.\u201d*\n\nAt the end, she shares her vision for the future of Ethereum, the internet, and technology and society in general, particularly in the context of fake news and deep fakes that can pose a great challenge to the truth.\n\n00:00:00 - 00:12:47: Political & personal circumstances of birth & childhood in Romania\n\n00:12:47 - 00:20:40: Cultivating independence from parents & direct access to truth\n\n00:20:40 - 00:26:21: How she got into Ethereum\n\n00:26:21 - 00:49:27: Volunteering philosophy vs. mainstream crypto culture\n\n00:49:27 - 00:58:17: Working independently vs. in companies\n\n00:58:17 - 01:02:31: Will Ethereum overcome its challenges?\n\n01:02:31 - 01:06:36: Generations of tech are decentralizing power\n\n01:06:36 - 01:12:37: Corporate attention war on the internet\n\n01:12:37 - 01:23:00: Rewarding provable work through the Laurel project\n\n01:23:00 - 01:35:25: Deepfakes & provable news\n\n01:35:25 - 01:40:12: Future society: provable morality\n\n**Part 2 \u00b7 Spirituality & Psychedelics \u00b7** [**website**](https://rss.com/podcasts/room-of-lives/472158/) **\u00b7** [**spotify**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6VxBqzSNfetQWYgXyzeSIg) **\u00b7** [**apple podcasts**](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/32-2-ethereum-developer-spirituality-psychedelics/id1598671453?i=1000559210731) **\u00b7** [**google podcasts**](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRpYS5yc3MuY29tL3Jvb20tb2YtbGl2ZXMvZmVlZC54bWw/episode/ODMxNGZhNjQtYjdkYi00MDRmLTk1ZjYtZTIxZjY1OTJmODMw?sa=X&ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwj4yKDewb33AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ)\n\n*\u201cMy spiritual journey started in childhood in a way, when I thought, \u2018What even am I, and what is this existence?\u2019*\n\n*\"My experience with iboga was an opening of selfless, non-static love that rewards you for wanting to evolve. On amanita, I was experiencing the life of a cell, then a fish, a human, and then a creator of worlds. These substances jolt you out of local minima, like in machine learning. But that is only half the task. Meditation must then guide you towards the true optimum.*\n\n*\"My spiritual and psychedelic experiences have inspired me to become a karma yogi. When I see injustice, I want to make things right, but it takes a lot of time to help people case by case. That\u2019s why I am volunteering to build tools and decentralized technology. The Laurel project is the generalization of my spiritual path.\u201d*\n\nIn this second part of my conversation with Romanian programmer and Ethereum developer Loredana Cirstea ([github](https://github.com/loredanacirstea), [twitter](https://twitter.com/lorecirstea), [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/LoredanaCirstea), [blog](https://loredanacirstea.medium.com/), [linkedin](https://de.linkedin.com/in/loredana-cirstea)), we talk about her experiences in spirituality and psychedelics. She shares her path into spirituality and Indian practices such as hatha yoga, fasting and meditation. Then she describes her visions on the iboga and the amanita mushroom, and I share how my psychedelic experiences exposed my deepest fears of losing my mind and dying. She then explains how her spiritual and psychedelic experiences inspired her towards karma yoga, the spiritual path of selfless work, and how she is trying to implement these ideas of provable volunteering on the blockchain, through her [Laurel project](https://laurel.provable.dev/).\n\n00:00:00 - 00:07:00: Journey into Indian spirituality, hatha yoga, fasting\n\n00:07:00 - 00:17:29: Psychedelics, & parallel to machine learning\n\n00:17:29 - 00:28:33: Psychedelic experiences on iboga\n\n00:28:33 - 00:31:47: Psychedelic experiences that exposed fears of death & losing my mind\n\n00:31:47 - 00:38:00: Psychedelic experiences on amanita\n\n00:38:00 - 00:41:13: How spirituality & psychedelics have inspired her towards karma yoga\n\n00:41:13 - 00:52:53: Bringing provable human effort to the blockchain\n\n[Full video of this podcast is on Loredana's YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P0NrXBKN_Y)",

                    "response": "(reposting my comment from the original thread)\n\n> NFT USE CASES\n\n> NFTs as a way of Ensuring Authenticity of Products\n\nHow is this at all different from just having a serial number with the product and using a centralized database on something like the company's website to check for authenticity? And how could you ensure the NFT stays associated with a physical good? \n\nWhat's stopping me from buying the product and getting the NFT and then just selling the NFT to someone else along with a counterfeit product while I keep the authentic original product?\n\n> NFTs for Medical Records and Identity Verification\n\n> There\u2019s something called a private chain which Unlike public blockchain platforms, private blockchain solutions tend to focus on privacy concerns. So don\u2019t worry your information is very much safe and private. \n\nWell that's reassuring. If you just claim that it's safe and private then I guess that's that.\n\nObviously this is not true. Anyone who's been following crypto news for any length of time knows that all kinds of hacks are extremely common. There is no magical safe and private solution that you or any other blockchain has discovered.\n\n> Wheen tranferring there\u2019s constant bottle necks in sorting through files and moving your record from hospital A to Hospital B, this is solved easily with the blockchain.\n\nAh yes, blockchain is known for having no bottlenecks. It's not like one of the greatest and most obvious weaknesses of blockchain tech is how long it takes for a transaction to actually be processed *especially* if that chain is seeing heavy use. For a perfect example of this just take a look at the Ethereum network today due to the BAYC metaverse launch.\n\nIt would be so awesome if during the next big medical emergency / pandemic / whatever when hospitals are overloaded and strained if their blockchain started to choke and then nobody could transfer any medical records at all. This is truly the future.\n\n> NFTs for solving Supply Chain constraints\n\nThis isn't really a problem so I'm not sure why you're trying to make it seem like one but either way this is just restating point #1 and has the same issues. NFTs can't be tied to actual physical goods in any way that makes them impossible to separate. They can't inherently be trusted to verify anything any more than a simple serial number could. We already have solutions for this problem and they work fine.",

Think of them as completely separate networks connected by various bridge services such as Connext/Synapse/Hop/etc. Your assets on Polygon aren't represented on mainnet nor are they on Arbitrum/Binance/Avalance/Gnosis/NEAR/Fantom/etc. You can use bridges to move assets between these networks. Not all dapps are deployed to each network, so if you have a specific dapp you'd like to use you'll want to figure out where it's deployed before withdrawing ETH from a CEX. Likewise, not all CEXes support all networks so you'll need to figure that out as well. Ethereum mainnet has bridges everywhere and is near-universally supported, but it's also the most expensive. \n\nIf you want to use an app on Arbitrum, you'll need to withdraw ETH to your address on Arbitrum and then you can access that app.",

You're probably better to buy on your CEX and transfer once you have a good amount. Another option is to deposit fiat in your CEX, buy stables, witjdraw to your wallet and buy directly on a DEX.",

You would have no idea, you'd have to trust the oracle node and data provider. This is where a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) comes into play.\n\nVRFs are an established cryptographic primitive where a private key and an input seed are used to create a pseudorandom output plus an associated proof. Pseudorandom in this context just means it uses math to generate randomness with the output being based on the input.\n\n\nThe KEY property is that with the proof, public key, and input value, the produced RNG value can be verified to not have been tampered with. Chainlink VRF leverages this established cryptographic primitive to provide smart contracts a verifiable source of randomness.\n\nNeither the oracle, users, developers, validators, or miners can manipulate the RNG value produced by Chainlink VRF. Chainlink VRF works by combining block data that is unknown when the request is made with the oracle\u2019s pre-committed private key to generate a random number & cryptographic proof off-chain.\n\nThe proof is verified on-chain & random number is delivered to the requesting contract. Even if the oracle node is compromised, it cannot manipulate the RNG, as the cryptographic proof would fail.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is that the node does not respond, which will be immediately apparent and forever visible on-chain.\n\nAPI3\u2019S QRNG is NOT a VRF because there is no cryptographic proof or on-chain verification; rather data is fetched via an API. This is a pretty high quality data source, where random numbers are generated by by measuring the quantum fluctuations of a vacuum. This also allows for the use of \"Quantum\" in the product name so it sounds super cool and secure.\n\nBut there's a problem:  Without a cryptographic proof, how can users verify that the random numbers delivered on-chain by QRNG haven't been manipulated?\n\nThey can't. The pitch is that the data provider / oracle node (ANU) is very trustworthy. It's a paper promise, not a cryptographic guarantee. \n\nAPI3's QRNG can be manipulated to respond with any arbitrary value *without detection*. That last part is important, there is zero way for you to verify if the response is legitimate randomness or not. You just need to trust the oracle node / data provider. \n\nTo make it clear, here are the worst case scenarios for VRF and QRNG:\n\nVRF: Node doesn't respond \n\nQRNG: Random values are manipulated to any arbitrary value without detection\n\nThe worst issue with QRNG is orders of magnitude worse than the worst issue of VRF.  Non-responsiveness is equally an issue for QRNG as well, but QRNG can manipulate responses in perpetuity without detection, which is infinitely worse.\n\nFurthermore, the off-chain RNG generator is hosted on AWS servers, so if AWS goes down, your RNG source goes down. \n\nhttps://quantumnumbers.anu.edu.au/faq",

Even discussing and trying to promote it so we can stake and win more eth.  \n\n\nMy friend however has some questions that I can't really answer, can anyone more knowledgeable help out?  \nOur question revolves around forking ETH and people simply continuing mining the fork. I know about the difficulty bomb and that at some point ETH will stall and die with ever increasing block times. However as my friend states what prevents a group of big money shots having a huge mining operation in the millions simply hiring developers (or themselves) to remove the difficulty bomb, after all its just a piece of code its somewhere there in the source code on ETH on Githib a team can find it and simply remove it.   \nI know it won't the original ETH but if miners continue to support this potential fork, and there is a team capable to remove the bomb it can continue living on its own and even have some developers working on it.",

Please read the disclaimer, guidelines, and rules before participating.**\n\nRules:\n\n* All [sub rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethereum/about/rules/) apply in this thread.\n* Discussion topics must be related to Ethereum.\n* Behave with civility and politeness. Do not use offensive, racist or homophobic language.\n* Comments will be sorted by newest first.\n\nUseful Links:\n\n* [Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org)\n* [ETHHub](https://ethhub.io/)\n* [ETHMerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/)\n\n**Reminder**\n\n/r/ethereum is a community for discussing the technology, news, applications and community of Ethereum. **Discussion of the Ether price or trading is not allowed.** Please keep those discussions to [/r/ethfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance) and [/r/ethstaker](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**\n\nThere are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.\n\n**When is Eth2 launching?**\n\nEth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. \"The Merge\", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.\n\nVisit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about \"The Merge\".\n\n**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**\n\nNo, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.\n\n**How can I stake my ETH?**\n\nThere are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.\n\n* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details\n* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)\n\n**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**\n\nLike most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.\n\n**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**\n\nEthereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.\n\nAdditionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.\n\nWhile rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.\n\n**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**\n\nThe most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre there questions you'd like to see added? Leave a comment below.",

You have transactions, that get collected into a block and tagged onto each other to form a blockchain.\n\nThe blockchain also has a state (current state of things like accounts, balances etc) This current state is as a result of the transactions in the blocks. So for example, if a new block with transactions is to be tagged onto the chain, the transactions it contains would be executed and that would affect the state. Moves it from a pre-state to a post-state (ie updates things like accounts, balances etc)\n\nWhat I do not get, when things like roll ups are discussed is data availability. What exactly is the data in data availability when discussing roll ups in ethereum? Is this the state?\n\nAnd I understand, correct me if I am wrong, that one of the scaling strategies is for level 1 (ie the main ethereum chain) to provide data availability so that methods like roll-ups can use it to provide scalability.\n\nAgain how does this work? What does data availability has to do with it?",

They just compress it.\n\nSo for example, with normal on-chain transactions, every transaction has to store a signature on chain. Those signatures are like a hundred bytes each, but you have to have them, so you can run through the transaction history, make sure all the transactions are valid, and verify the today's balances.\n\nA zkrollup batches up lots of transactions off-chain, and replaces all the signatures with one little proof. Then it can send the proof and the new balances to a contract on chain. (It can do more than simple transfers, just keeping it simple.)\n\nThe contract checks the proof, and by doing that can verify that all the new balances are the result of valid transactions with good signatures and sufficient sender balances. Assuming the proof checks out, it updates the balances. \n\nSo you can just look at the balances in this contract, and know that everything is valid, without seeing all the transactions that went into it and their signatures. You can get close to 100X data compression.\n\nIf you want to withdraw your ETH from the rollup, you send the contract an on-chain transaction, it checks your balance in its ledger, reduces the balance and sends you the ETH.",
