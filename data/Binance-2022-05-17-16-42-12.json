I did have a few more texts about Amazon, Paypal and B&Q (?) at the same time, so someone is definitely using my details for something. I even got messages from Muslim Aid saying  had set up a direct debit of \u00a3900 a month - but I think that was spam because it wanted me to open a PDF file. I didn't, of course. I've changed passwords and login details on all relevant accounts, and my bank account, just in case. I've contacted B&Q and Muslim Aid but had no replies.  \nI chatted online at length to a reddit moderator here and asked to cancel any Binance account (if there was one). they said they sent me a verification code by email, but no email arrived and I had to go out, so I quit the conversation. I've not received any other suspicious texts/messages since so I think I'll leave it like that..  \nBut again, thanks for your reply.",
