The specific question is, *\"What are the ideals and intent behind cryptocurrency?\",* and right now I'm trying to find information on one of the main currencies I'll be focusing on which is, of course, Bitcoin and Ethereum. I need more info on Ethereum because except for one book I found, there is not much. Could someone please point me to the right place?",

Bankless have a podcast series called 'Layer 0' where they interview developers, contributors and even Vitalik's dad. These may help you get inside the heads of the builders a little bit.\n\nThe network itself is neutral, in fact that is one of the core values I guess, alongside decentralization, trustlessness, permissionlessness and the other goals that evolved from the original cypherpunk vision that gave birth to Bitcoin.\n\nFor a book I'd recommend Camilla Rossi's The Infinite Machine. It gives a great overview of the origin story of Ethereum .",

Actually, the book I mentioned is Camilla Rossi's *The Infinite Machine.* Unfortunately, because I have to site most of the sources I use (I'm doing research for a school essay), I don't think I can use videos. I don't know how to cite from a video in MLA Format, and I don't think it is allowed. Thanks anyway, however!",
