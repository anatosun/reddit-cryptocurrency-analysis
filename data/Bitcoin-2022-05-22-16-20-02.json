It appears more people and countries are starting to look this way.   But let\u2019s say with all the attention lately that there has been a ton of money going into it.   Like big amounts of money.    How does the price stay in this range for now?   From people shorting it and big money holding it bakc?   I hope that makes sense.   I mean like say someone with big money threw into it right now.  Could it break the cycle it\u2019s been in?   It feels like these are all just algos like the stock market.   I\u2019m not saying it is, I just don\u2019t know.  \nI\u2019ve seen numbers on he people who just hold Bitcoin for long term gains.  Which means there is only so much remaining right?    Do you all know of Bitcoin to be manipulated just like stocks or no?",

Previously it (the price) was manipulated in different ways (where, as you say, a whale was capable of sell a large amount, tank the price, and buy it back cheaper on another exchange before the rebound), and is expected to decouple in the future, where is also to be expected it will be manipulated in new ways.\n\nSomeone, person or corporation, interested in purchasing large amounts will turn to OTC (Over The Counter), where an agreed amount is purchased at an agreed price off exchange, avoiding price sliding. Given its scarcity however, if demand is maintained or increased the price will keep adjusting upwards.\n\nThe longer Bitcoin doesn't die, the more it spreads throughout the world with its multiple use cases and technological innovations and the more awareness is created about the change it represents.",
