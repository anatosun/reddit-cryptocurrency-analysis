Most of the growth of DeFi is due to the rise of decentralized oracles, which allow blockchains to access external data on their own. However, using centralized oracles could negate the advantages of having a smart contract, which raises significant privacy issues.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Many of the problems are centralization issues. \n\nAnd to provide for more secure oracles, just have a public bounty to help you spot discrepancies between expected behavior and actual behavior.",
