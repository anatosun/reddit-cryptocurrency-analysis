            "selftext": "So I understand more or less how bitcoin mining works, but I'm missing something.\n\nI get that bitcoin miners change the nonce in order to vary the hash. But why are the nonces so low? Before seeing the nonce value displayed on a blockchain explorer, I thought that the nonce was a 256 bit number, and people would just randomly generate values to try. This would obviously never cause collisions, and seemed fairly simple.\n\nBut I realise now, that the nonce values are incredibly small (around a billion). So is something changing in the data to mean that nonces are reset quickly enough to not exhaust the nonce range? Is it the timestamp, or something else as well?\n\nI would love to know how this works, please.",

                    "response": "> Is it the timestamp, or something else as well?\n\nBoth, but mainly something else, because the nonce rolls over about 25,000 times per second, and the timestamp has 1-second precision  \n\nThe nonce is 32 bits, which is a value between 0 and 4,294,967,295. That's a touch over 4 billion  \n\nA current generation Bitcoin mining device hashes 110 trilllion or 140 trillion hashes per second  \n\nThose are the numbers. What about the process?  \n\nBitcoin mining is a guessing competition. The winning condition is to have a block of transactions which has a header (the first 80 bytes of the block) which has a hash which is smaller than the current target  \n\nThe nonce is one of the 6 fields in the 80-byte block header  \n\n*    version  \n*    previous block header hash  \n*    Merkle root hash  \n*    time  \n*    target, known as nBits, a 32-bit compressed expression of the 256-bit target  \n*    nonce  \n\nhttps://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/block_chain.html#block-headers  \n\nWhy a nonce? Because incrementing by 1 is computationally fast. Cryptographic hashes are designed to produce an unpredictable result with any change to the input, even the smallest possible change, flipping a single bit from 0 to 1. The consequence of this behavior is that a hashing algorithm has a random distribution of results. That's why hashing is a good choice for a guessing competition  \n\nFrom a different direction: there are 5 header fields apart from the nonce, each of which has a purpose. The guessing competition requires the miner to change the block header repetitively to get a different hash, without changing the functional contents of the block - the other 5 header fields, and the transaction set. Repeatedly incrementing the nonce is the simplest computation for changing the header for each hashing calculation  \n\nOK so far, but as mining processors got fast and faster, the 32-bit nonce rolled around to its starting value after about 4 billion guesses, and the miner attempts more than 4 billion guesses in the race to win the next block  \n\nSo the miner has to change something else, one of the other header fields. But (see above) those 5 header fields all have their own purposes. What about the timestamp? Yes, that works. The miner is able to modify the timestamp once per second or less frequently. If the miner is guessing less than 4 billion hashes per second, he can vary the timestamp every time the nonce rolls over  \n\nASIC mining devices kept getting faster, exceeded 4 GH/sec fairly early in Bitcoin's history. The smart mining pool techs invented extranonce  \n\nWe've run out of fields to change directly, but the Merkle root hash can be changed indirectly, because it is calculated by building a Merkle tree of the block's transaction set, and because the first transaction in every block (transaction #0, coinbase transaction) belongs to the miner  \n\nThe first transaction in every block pays the block reward. Unlike other transactions it has exactly one transaction input, and the transaction input does not spend an older transaction output. It can be seen as a dummy input, or placeholder. The coinbase tx input has space for up to 100 bytes of arbitrary data. Mining pools chose to allocate 8 of those bytes for extranonce. The contents of extranonce are random, extracted from the entropy generator of the miner's computer's operating system  \n\nHow does extranonce change the 80-byte block header? Each transaction in the block is hashed. The tx hashes are arranged in pairs and the hash pairs are hashed in a binary tree structure called a Merkle tree. At the top of the tree, the Merkle root hash is one of the 6 header fields. Its purpose in the header is to immutably represent all the transactions in the block  \n\nAs with all hashing, a small change to the input causes a completely different hash. Changing the 8 bytes of extranonce in the coinbase tx input changes the coinbase transaction's tx hash, which in turn changes the Merkle tree and the Merkle root hash  \n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch10.asciidoc  \nSearch down to \"The Extra Nonce Solution\"  \n\nSummary of the mining process  \n\n*    select transactions, calculate Merkle tree, populate the other 4 header fields, leave the nonce as it ended the previous round of mining  \n*    hash the header, if hash less than target, winner!  \n*    increment nonce  \n*    repeat previous 2 steps 4294967295 more times  \n*    in parallel with the nonce increment and hashing work, find the next extranonce, recalculate the Merkle tree, and Merkle root hash (in parallel because we don't want to delay hashing while these calculations are done)  \n*    repeat previous 3 steps until the clock time advances one second, change timestamp in header  \n*    repeat previous 4 steps until one miner wins the race  \n*    start hashing the next block",

            "selftext": ", the European Central Bank (ECB) published the results of a new survey conducted in six regions of the Eurozone: the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Belgium, France and Germany. About 10% of respondents in the countries surveyed said they owned cryptocurrencies. Within this group, only 6% of respondents said they owned digital assets worth more than \u20ac30,000. Meanwhile, 37% of respondents said they owned up to \u20ac999 in cryptocurrencies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAcross all countries surveyed, the richest 20% of the population consistently had the highest percentage of investors holding cryptocurrencies relative to other income groups. The survey asked adults between the ages of 18 and 70 whether they or anyone in their household owned various categories of financial assets, such as crypto assets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe survey is included in a new report released by the ECB on the same day on the growing adoption of crypto assets despite the risk factors. As cited by the ECB, 56% of respondents to a recent Fidelity survey said they held some exposure to crypto assets, up from 45% in 2020. The growing availability of cryptocurrency-based derivatives and securities on regulated exchanges, such as futures, exchange-traded notes, exchange-traded funds and OTC trusts, are driving this momentum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTranslated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](https://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version)",
