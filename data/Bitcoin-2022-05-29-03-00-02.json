Right now, no it makes little sense for a westerner to spend Bitcoin, both for tax reasons and as you say the volatility. We are still in price discovery, at the same time the legacy system is showing major cracks of its own. So the Bitcoin price in dollar terms is going to jump all over the place as the two paradigms go in opposite directions (my opinion). \n\nBut I don't think Bitcoin will stay this volatile forever as it matures from digital curiosity --> collectible --> store of value --> medium of exchange. As you point out, it's a shorter road in places where the local currency is already more volatile than Bitcoin. In those places it's already basically a no-brainer. For us in more stable places, it will take a while to get there, but perhaps not as long as many think. \n\nBut the point I was making is that even here, whether it's optimal to do so or not, it is possible and not even that difficult to live your life mostly or fully on Bitcoin, if you wanted to. The criticism that you can't buy anything with Bitcoin is simply ignorant. Yes, you can. If you wanted, you could buy all your gas and groceries with Bitcoin. It's becoming easier almost by the month. To take one recent example, Strike just announced a partnership with 3 of the largest Point Of Sale companies to bring Bitcoin payments to the largest retailers in the country (think Best Buy). The same agreement is bringing Bitcoin payments to Shopify, which has huge implications for e-commerce.",

Every currency is used digitally on a daily basis, the only thing that changes is the type of currency.  Just like how most people in the stock market don't physically own paper stocks and leave them in a \"digital\" form with their stock broker.   Just because something can be transacted digitally, doesn't mean that you can only use it to purchase digital items.  Except with Bitcoin, the currency and the transaction method are tied together.",

I don\u2019t think it makes sense to invest in any currency\u2026 Now if you want to use that currency and convert your assets to it because you think it is more \u201cstable\u201d that is fine. \n\nBut anything that is not generating a cash flow should not be treated as an investment.
