But if you ran Bitcoin through the properties of sound money, it'd be a no-brainer to embrace it. A few visionaries like Roger Ver did, and were rewarded.\n\nToday it's 2022. If you run Bitcoin through the same course, you'll find it's not the most ideal currency in terms of soundness. Bitcoin Cash seems to excel. What do you think?",
