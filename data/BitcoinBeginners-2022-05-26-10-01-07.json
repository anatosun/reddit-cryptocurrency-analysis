You choose exactly how many sats go to the recipient, and then you choose a mining fee to go on top of that. \n\nThe best thing for fees is to choose \"custom,\" and choose a low fee based on what you see at [mempool.space](https://mempool.space). Do not use your wallets built-in estimate, you will overpay. Often, including right now, the minimum payment of 1 sat/vbyte is enough to clear within 30 minutues. \n\nIf you you do underpay the fee and get stuck in the mempool, your wallet should have a function called RBF that allows you to increase the TX fee.",
