A block can only handle so many transactions at a time, so they will choose the transactions with the highest fees.  If the network isn't busy, pretty much all transactions will go through with each block. So in that case it wouldn't matter how high your fee is.  A 1 sat/b fee will go through just as quickly as a 100 sat/b fee.\n\nIt's only when there are more transactions than can be completed in a block that the lower fees will have to wait.  And if there are always more new transactions than a block can handle, the fees will eventually get pushed higher and higher because people will always want to put higher fees so their transactions get included without waiting too long.\n\nHopefully that answers your question.  If not let me know, and I'll try again.",
