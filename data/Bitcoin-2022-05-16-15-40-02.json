In fact it's widely used in the biomedical field.  Stanford is currently doing medical research with gold nanoparticles.  \n\nIt's obviously in extremely high demand in the jewelry industry (which you completely ignored), and has been for thousands of years, but it's also extensively used in electronics, because it doesn't corrode and it's an extremely good electrical conductor.  Your phone has several dollars worth of gold in it. \n\nGold is also widely used in the aerospace industry, where its inert self-lubricating properties make it indispensable.  Look at any spacecraft and you'll see gold parts all over it. \n\nGold has very unique properties, including amazing malleability (it can be pounded into a sheet just a few atoms thick) and a relatively low melting point, which has made it highly sought after for millennia.  \n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, doesn't exist physically, and its only practical use seems to be limited to serving as an imaginary vehicle for shady transactions and irrational speculation with no logical basis in the physical world.  And ironically, it probably uses more energy to \"mine\" bitcoin every year than it does to mine and process gold, all while generating a metric fuck-ton of ewaste.",
