I forgot to mention, a FREE user experience.\n\nMainstream consumers are accustomed to a free internet experience. The Ethereum Network is the antithesis to free. \n\nAnd there's no guarantee that ETH 2.0 sharding will actually lower gas fees.\n\nThat's why I'm long-term bearish on Ethereum.",

Right now, yes, it's relatively difficult, because L2s are still very young, need to mature more and need more adoption (both from users and cexs). The ecosystem within an L2 should be the exact same as the L1, provided your dapps have deployed to the L2 (a lot have deployed to L2s like Arbitrum, and more are being deployed).\n\nSo, if you're complaining about anything other than getting onto an L2, you're not complaining about L2s, you're complaining about the state of using cryptocurrencies, and hence the state of the crypto space in itself. Any other L1 will be just as difficult to use, and so this argument doesn't hold any water, *if you're complaining about anything other than getting onto an L2.*",

Sure, it's expensive to use, but not once has it become genuinely unusable (as in, not responsive, ie crashed).\n\nEvery other smart contract chain that is available right now has the potential to be more secure and reliable than Ethereum, I'm not going to deny that, but they have yet to prove it.\n\nSome chains just haven't hit critical mass when it comes to adoption, others have intentionally throttled the network while under development. Some even already hit the point where they become unresponsive (Solana inadvertently rendered itself unusable by basically attacking itself with a denial-of-service type attack a little while ago).\n\nThat, plus the fact that it's where the majority of value and networking lies, makes it very valuable for the bigger players, who prioritise security and reliability over how cheap the network is to use. And since users naturally gravitate to the network with the most adoption, they will end up using Ethereum over others, until others see enough adoption to overtake Ethereum.\n\n> Why would the market just not migrate to a better option in the future that runs everything on a layer one?\n\nAlready answered this above, but I will add that it's basically impossible for an L1 smart contract chain to scale enough to support mass adoption on a global scale. What TPS do you think is necessary? 10k? 100k? Try millions. That's what it'd take for mass adoption on a global scale.\n\nThis is why rollups are such an important innovation, because they can deliver that TPS for the end user by using the L1 TPS more efficiently, by bundling hundreds, even thousands of L2 transactions into a single L1 transaction.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pk57n7/why_rollups_data_shards_are_the_only_sustainable/",

                            "response": "I'm going to add to this with an explanation why this is the most economically sensible approach.\n\nBlockchains pay for their necessary security in 2 ways: issuance (newly minted coins paid to the validators) and fees (coins paid to the validators by those using the network).\n\n- Issuance is a zero-sum economic activity from the point of view of the network, there is no value created through issuance. All the token-holders are diluting themselves through issuance to give those coins to the validators to pay for their job.\n\n- Fees are not a zero-sum economic activity from the point of view of the network, on the contrary, they are a tax on the users of the network to pay for its security. There is valued accrued into the network via fees, as transactions that carry economic activity settled on the network are taxed by the network to pay for its security budget.\n\nWith this in mind it's obvious you want total fees paid to the network to be as high as possible. On the other hand, a ghost chain with insignificant total-fees paid by its users is wasteful and unnecessary. There is no economic activity settled by the network, all its security budget is coming through self-dilution but there is still some very real expenses to pay for securing the network.\n\nUp to here I hope to have made the case for why high total fees are a good sign of a healthy blockchain.\n\nNow you just need another piece of information. Blockchains have finite resources, the resource of a blockchain being its block-space or how many transactions you can fit per unit of time. In fact, blockchains are very resource-constrained as you cannot use the conventional vertical scalability (beefier machines) or horizontal scalability (more machines) techniques you can use in other kinds of systems without sacrificing decentralization or security, respectively. So we have a finite resource (blockspace) for which we want to maximize total value paid for it, this implies average value per transaction goes up.\n\nNow you should have all the pieces to understand why a healthy blockchain is likely to be expensive to use.\n\nAnd this is why Ethereum's scalability roadmap involves so prominently L2s. Because they are the only way that we can meet the conditions explained above of a healthy blockchain without pushing out of it the needs of low-value use cases that require small fees. With L2s we can bundle together many low-value fees into high-value fees that can pay to exist in L1.",

People write posts like this as if Eth is some big corporation and you can complain to the manager.\n\nYou can't, the sad fact is, the network doesn't care about you (or me) in this situation. DeFi protocols, trading funds, large DAOs and whales, are happy to pay main net transaction prices and the sad fact is that transactional utility of Eth is going to have to be L2s for the majority of people.",

You may also elect to file these as non-taxable exchanges if you wish. We recommend that you consult a tax professional.\n\n> The IRS has not issued guidance about the tax treatment of multichain bridging. However, conceptually the action is similar to wrapping or minting a token. For example, Interlay allows users to mint bitcoin onto Polkadot as PolkaBTC.\n\n> Thus, like minting or wrapping tokens, bridging crypto could likely be interpreted as either a taxable or non-taxable event.

If you want cheap fees, move to an L2 network like Arbitrum or Optimism, which can more efficiently use that L1 block space to reduce fees charged within the L2. It'll cost one last full price L1 fee, but once you're in an L2, you'll never have to touch the L1 network ever again.",

I think in the long term UI improves so much, atm new users have to wrap their heads about too much technically and all these diff networks.\n\nI think in the future users will use an Ethereum scaling solutions without even knowing so. Its like YouTube or other front end services. The average consumer doesn't need to know about which serves or technical specifics on how YouTube runs.

High fees are a result of network demand and limited block space available on the Ethereum L1.

Then there are ZK roll-ups which are seen as the end goal.\n\n>\"If fees are still high, back-end producers will eventually push costs to front-end consumers. This too is a foundational economic concept.\"\n\nYou're missing the point again. High fees will only be on Ethereum L1. Regular users or anyone will small amounts of crypto will not be using the base layer. They will be using L2 solutions as mentioned, which have much much much lower fees (especially once or if everything comes together).\n\nAgain, I take you back to my YouTube example. We are still in very primative UI state, to meet consumer needs and make it easy for ppl to transact alot of users will not even know they are using an Ethereum scaling solution. ATM there is not the infrastructure or UI focus to make this happen as there is a need to deliver the scaling solutions first, and then better UI will come later.\n\nYou seem to be stuck on the fact that regular users will be using Ethereum L1and scared of high gas. This is how it is atm, but long term regular users will NOT be using L1.",

When you withdraw your crypto from L2 to L1 it takes 7 days and they are batched so you're paying for the withdrawal.\n\nAs per the validating of transactions there is profit margins involved from what I understand. When you pay transaction fees on Arbitrum, a portion of it goes to Arbitrum, while the rest is put back into paid to Ethereum for security and data availability.\n\nThey are public goods essentially, but there is profit margins involved from what I understand. \n\nI know Optimism is set up as a Public Benefit Corporation, according to Optimisms  website \"Until the project is fully decentralized, we will be donating all profits from running a centralized sequencer towards scaling and sustaining public goods.\" So they are able to make some money via this it seems which can help ensure fees are low and pay for security.\n\nI'm not sure it is as clear cut as \"L2 protocols pay for L1 fees\" as the lower fees itself are a feature of it's security and product, which can be helped by the above mentioned profit margins.\n\nAgain,I encourage anyone to correct me if I'm wrong, just providing my understanding.

And a deflationary currency, that is supposed to be decentralized, but has been mostly accumulated before most people have started using it feels like it\u2019s going more down the path of the status quo than we might like the think.\n\nEdit: But actually I think that that - depending on the cost - people are willing to pay for things like security and privacy, as long as they are convinced it\u2019s important and affordable.

I don't mean to make it sound like a judgement, like I said, I'm definitely stoked on what people are going to come up with, and I think the next few years are going to be both exciting and disruptive. And I'm definitely not selling my Eth! But just because something is disruptive doesn't mean it has to be dominant in the long run, and I think it's important to be honest about it's pitfalls. Obviously people in the space are doing that and their capacity to innovate is nothing short of mindblowing to me. However as someone who is not a computer scientist, but who does build and develop things, I can tell you not everything can be fully functional simply because there are fundamental flaws in design that you couldn't possibly anticipate at the time you built it.\n\nDunno if that is the case here in a fatal way, but I spent a little while learning about IT things earlier this year, and while the user experience of the internet has changed a bit, there are quite a few layers happening behind the scenes; and most of those have been upgraded/changed dramatically since the internet was first created. I think the difference as I see it, is \"the internet\" is more comparable to blockchain technology, as opposed to Ethereum which is actually more of a protocol, but even now that I'm saying that I think that my understanding may be lacking.  I'm super excited to see one way or the other what happens in this ecosystem and everything else in this space, and I kind of expect there will not be a definitive answer for a long time, if ever!",

First, it\u2019s volume and current utilization is so much bigger other projects aren\u2019t really comparable right now, and while things may make sense in theory there are reasons why most new projects haven\u2019t succeeded, and I\u2019m sure that will continue to be true. \n\nSecond, we as users are getting a look at past development, given how the past year has been I\u2019m sure there is an absurd amount of stuff that will be coming out in the next few years and much of it will be on Ethereum in no small part due to point one, so I think it\u2019s only going to get more functional. This will also be happening on a wide variety of other projects, but the variety will hinder any of them from being dominant until one or more really prove themselves in terms of security and development in addition to functionality. Because it\u2019s really about balance, which is my third reason. The more people that use it makes it more secure, which makes it more appealing to those who haven\u2019t been brave enough to make the jump yet. \n\nAnd fourth, if you are someone who has been in the space for a few years at least (most of the power users) then your cost average is so low that while it might gall you to pay $100 worth of Eth to execute a smart contract but I doubt you actually paid $100 for that Eth, and that\u2019s a huge difference. I\u2019m sure that that\u2019s what they are hoping to have happen for people as they keep using it, but fairness is a very inmate quality in all mammals, and I think that this will come a foul of that instinct at some point without becoming deeply hypocritical.\n\nSo basically I think that like a lot of first movers that are truly something new, getting from vision to execution is so difficult and complicated that you change the global perception but it\u2019s hard to beat the fact that someone can almost certainly build a better mousetrap. And as you said, they definitely already are, at which point the need for functionality will overcome security because functionality will equal security.\n\nHow about you? Why do you think people are going to flock to other projects?",

And sending things to L2 is not only expensive, but it's also confusing, with all the different L2 and whatnot. And now there's talk of rollups, whatever that is and however it's used. Too complicated/expensive for the general public.\n\nMeanwhile, it looks like the competitors are cheaper, faster, and no need to deal with separate... things like L2 or rollups. I expected the Ethereum move to PoS would solve most of these problems, but the more I learn about it, the more I'm convinced it'll hardly make a difference.\n\nSo I'm intensely debating with myself if I keep my investment in ETH the way it is, or if I make the move (of at least part of it) to another project that doesn't have these problems Ethereum has, before these other projects see an even bigger price rise and I make the move too late.",

                    "response": "It's a problem of it's own success unfortunately. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only 2 projects with sufficient use to fill the blocks, this means more users are trying to write to the chain than there is space to record it all. Because not everyone can get in we effectively have to compete for space by offering increased fees to ensure the miners pick our transaction over the others available.\n\nThe obvious question is why not increase the blocksize? The problem is that this increases requirements for those running the network's nodes and would mean less people do it, meaning Ethereum would become more centralized. This is why the Binance Smart Chain is able to have lower fees, the whole network is validated by only 11 active nodes, rather than the thousands that run the Ethereum network. Decentralization has a price, but luckily it is pretty well embedded in the project's core values.\n\nOther L1s which boast of much lower fees are able to do so because their network isn't experiencing use at the volume that causes the blocks to be full, meaning there is no competition for space and so fees can be as low as they like.\n\nI mentioned bitcoin has the same full block issue, but the difference is in the complexity of the data people are wanting to add to the chain. All you will really be doing with Bitcoin is recording a transfer from one address to another, this requires very little information to be recorded and so even if block space is in high demand you don't need to use much of it. In comparison, interacting with a smart contract to swap one token type for another requires more data to be recorded and so will be more expensive. If you're doing something even more complex like creating a Uniswap V3 liquidity pool, where price ranges need to be recorded and you're effectively minting an NFT for your unique segment of the pool then the cost to do so is even higher.\n\nIn the future we'll see more and more of the ecosystem's transactions move to L2 solutions, whether sidechains like Polygon/Matic (which you can already use with dApps like AAVE and Curve) or rollups (which you can use now with dYdX). Ultimately we might get sharding of the L1, where validators only build a segment of the network each blocktime, but that won't be coming for a while. Before that, once the merge to PoS is completed it might be possible to increase the blocksize, as without the demands of PoW the larger space required for each block shouldn't have such an effect on decentralization.\n\nEthereum is the biggest project in the whole of crypto in terms of developers and development, it's been copied countless times and has an entire new economic world being built upon it. If you want a token that you can send quickly and cheaply then there are much better options available, XLM or NANO would be more appropriate for a lot of simple use cases. If you want a tech that's easy to understand and more reliably predictable then go with BTC.\n\nEthereum isn't the best coin for many, many users, but it is the most interesting project I've ever followed and I want the future that is being build upon it. If something else takes the place of leading the DeFi world, maybe Cardano, Cosmos, Polkadot or whatever than I'll happily move to that ecosystem, but for now Ethereum is it, and because of that we have to suck up high L1 fees.\n\nIn the short term, L2 solutions are going to be the answer, that and watching the gas-price like a hawk for the best times to make your moves.\n\nhttps://ethereumprice.org/gas/",
