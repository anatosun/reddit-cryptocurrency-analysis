Last time I checked it was not supported and a link to Coinbase to convert it to their phone wallet. I don't want to use Coinbase. Can anyone recomend a simple phone wallet. I'm not too concerned with a lot of features, just something simple. Thank you in advance.",

            "selftext": "So I know this will probably get hate but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be brought up so here it goes. We all know the government is coming out with their own cbdc and a digital id system. With the help of the WEF the US is able to implement these systems. The WEF has many of the biggest companies as their partners including a lot of our phone service providers and internet companies. As well as a ton of other tech companies like google apple etc. Now i know this forum would say bitcoin can't be shut down because you can't shutdown the internet. And even if they blocked bitcoin websites you could just use a VPN. Now I'll take it a step further because our governments don't mind taking extreme steps to further the global agenda. Let's say this new system would require that in order for you to have internet you must be a part of this new system and have the new ID and use the new digital dollar to pay for that internet. And the US would require all companies to abide by their new rules and regulations. If you aren't a part of the new system you can't have what you used to have. You are kicked out and left for dead. Now I am religious and truly believe the cbdc and digital ID is the mark of the beast. I hate this system and it seems likely to happen. I think for sure gold and silver can help people to stay out of that system. And I think bitcoin is cool and could possibly fight off that system. But I also know the powerful want this new system and don't care what toes they step on to get there. They've basically been prepping us with forced lockdowns locked bank accounts shutting off speech and tons more. So to end it what if this happens? I understand bitcoin wants to put up a fight and that's really cool. But governments and huge companies have a lot of power and provide us all our resources. If they lock us out then what do we have. This is one reason why I think in this scenario gold and silver seem to be better suited to fight off the government. Hopefully this can be proven wrong though.",

Most of the US, other than politicians, do not want globalism and believe Bitcoin is the way to do that. Andrew Torba, founder of Gab social media platform found out how hard it is to go against the status quo but he did it using Bitcoin. Gold and silver were old money protectors and that\u2019s why they try so hard to keep it up. If you noticed when Gold was falling in value Bitcoin was rising, old money had to knock it down, and when Bitcoin went down Gold started to rise. There has always been a black market and that will never change. The US will adapt there digital money because they don\u2019t want to lose money to other countries that have found a way out of US control. This administration let it slip that if they control usd they can sanction other countries for whatever reasons and smaller countries now know they need to get away from the American dollar. Bitcoin is global but not part of the globalism agenda, no entity solely controls it, which is why they try to get as much as they can before we do, they haven\u2019t been able to stop it , and now they want the most nodes they can get. They\u2019re thinking they\u2019ll change it from the inside out, but we continue to peck away. They love all the crypto that takes money away from Bitcoin. The world is in turmoil, countries are turning to nationalism, Pandora\u2019s box is open, and  Bitcoin is will pave the way.",

If they see Bitcoin as a threat they would (will) stop it.\n\n>Additionally they also can't stop it,\n\nThey can stop it. Make it a felony to own, send, or run any crypto exchange in all major regions like USA, Canada, EU, Russa, China, India, Australia and Bitcoin will drop 99.9% of its value. The only question whether they want to stop it.\n\n>remember they are your public servents, you can actually demand from them that they work for your interests.\n\nOh my sweet summer child.",

If all major regions: USA, Canada, Russia, India, Australia, India and the EU bans cryptocurrency, and by ban, think of it as a felony if you own, send, or run any crypto currency broker, then its price would tank 99.9%. That would be the end of Bitcoin.  \n\n\nGuys will downvote and argue with unmature arguments like \"Drugs are illegal too\" but this is a whole different topic. Bitcoin can thrive because it is the people's money. If you make it illegal it will really be the criminals money, thus 99.9% people would sell, including institutions, because they would be forced to do so.  \n\n\nThe question is whether this scenario will happen or not. I might say not, or not in the near future, but you cannot say Bitcoin is unkillable.",
