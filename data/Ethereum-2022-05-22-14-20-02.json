SEBI said that crypto assets are neither defined as securities under Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 or SCRA, nor are they notified as securities by the Central Government. As on date, crypto is not regulated and has been named as virtual digital assets for taxation purpose only.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

It doesn't mix with a censorship resistant ecosystem. \n\nAnd it only \"protects\" against some scams instead of all of them by wasting lots of your own money in the process. \n\nPeople simply need to learn. Better awareness tools, notably, would be welcomed.",
