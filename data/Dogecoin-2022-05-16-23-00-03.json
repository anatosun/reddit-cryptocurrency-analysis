Ledger is just a big brand with great security and widely recognized as being very secure. Just like all other hardwares you are given a 24 digit series of words that you and only you know. Never lose those words (your password if you were to lose it). In order to turn on your ledger you either have a 4 or 8 digit password. If the physical Ledger hard drive breaks or gets damaged or you lose it you simply buy a new one and replace it and once you type in your code and tada your back in business. If you lose it or someone steals it they can't get into your account without your codes and passwords. The physical Ledger is useless without a code to access your account.\nAll your data is stored on the block chain if Ledger were to go out of business you still have access to the block chain with your 24 word address and password. This is a very thought out process and tool, that everyone should have to safely secure their assets. On a app like Robinhood, coinbase, etc. They are the middle man that controls your money. With a Ledger you are in complete control",

I do agree that you can move it out of the CEX for peace of mind and ownership of your own crypto, but exodus or a similar hot wallet will do just fine.\n\nThe price of a hardware wallet is a big barrier of entry for most small retails users. I'd venture that depending on your risk profile, a cold wallet is only worth it after its price reaches about 10% of your portfolio.Good security habits in using a computer plus safekeeping of the mnemonic/private key will mostly keep a 1000\u20ac account safe on a hot wallet without the need to spend over a hundred bucks on hardware.\n\n\"Real crypto investor\" is just BS. You can be hardcore dedicated to crypto and not own cold storage due to risk-benefit analysis due to small portfolio size and saving money to investor more. Your wealth does not determine the \"realness\" of your investments.",
