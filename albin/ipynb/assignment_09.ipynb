There are dozens of versions and implementations online, none are simple or straightforward, but in the lecture I tried an explanation that keeps the complexity to a minimum. It may be confusing to find which part does what and how to implement it, so I added a few tips that I hope will limit your debugging time. Enjoy!"

If you draw the four points, you will see they are not linearly separable. However you can write a neural network with one hidden layer of two neurons that solves the problem. Initialize the network with random weights, then execute the backpropagation algorithm by hand on paper until you solve it. This is a great exercise if you're stuck with the implementation of backprop and you cannot figure out what went wrong, as it forces you to get the dimensions right. Using 3 hidden neurons is a bit simpler and should require less iterations."
