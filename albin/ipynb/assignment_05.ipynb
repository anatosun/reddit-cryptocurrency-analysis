It is time to introduce to you the math applications of Pandas DataFrame and Series, and to the unfriendly but oh-so-useful `groupby()`.\n","\n","From now on we will be using Pandas for our main data structures, even in the math calculation. Remember that they wrap around Numpy arrays while giving convenient indexing and extra capabilities. No need to e.g. split the points depending on the class into a `dict` as we did before: we can _group_ data by label, then all operations will work on the whole feature arrays and for all classes at once (and running the underlying, optimized C implementation).\n","Simply treat a DataFrame just like you would a multi-dimensional Numpy array (and a Series as if it was a one-dimensional Numpy array). Function calls will be _broadcasted_ to its elements.\n","\n","We will use `groupby()` extensively. It can be slow to grasp at first, but your code will be legible and you will need (almost) no more loops nor `dict`s. \n","Careful because it returns [a `GroupBy` object](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/groupby.html) that is somehow unwieldy: it removes a feature, adds a dimension (the grouping), and does not print directly. Try to follow it with a `describe()` to see its application, or print the `groups` for an intuition on how it works: basically a `dict` from each element of the group (e.g. the classes) to the indices of the corresponding rows. Basically it's just an implicit split on the data, and now any operation you call on the GroupBy object will return multiple results (one per group) instead of just one. Go ahead and give it a try, understanding this is necessary before moving on to the next questions, and it's easier if you play with it yourself: the trick that did it for me was to try and ignore its output *per se*, and instead just call functions on it such as `describe()`. \n","\n","You need to start thinking of the data as a whole, high-dimensional entity, and your exploration as selecting and slicing this object from different perspectives as if you were \"floating around it in space\".
