Follow [this tutorial](http://bebi103.caltech.edu.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2015/tutorials/r5_pca.html). Challenge: no copy+paste allowed, type everything, muscle memory is much more effective at retaining experience than passive study. Particularly useful is the discussion at the end: learn that Dimensionality Reduction _hides_ information! It is extremely dangerous to found your decisions on a PCA plot on a subset of axis (e.g. 2), people have lost entire careers on that!"

        "- Supervised Learning imply the presence of a _supervisor_ in the data preparation. This is typically either a human (which means limited data, human errors, time constraints, etc.), or (lately more common) another algorithm that is used as an _oracle_. In Deep Reinforcement Learning we will see that the reward function is learned through SL; in Self-Supervised Learning and in Embeddings applications it is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm to provide the oracle.\n",
        "- All applications of UL stem from two concepts:\n",
        "    - **Similarity**: similar things are put together, different things are separated.\n",
        "    - **Information**: data contains redundancy and noise which can be mitigated by studying/extracting global patterns and references.\n",
        "- Unsupervised Learning is almost always present one way or another in complex applications, yet rarely recognized or credited for what it is -- it's always \"embedding\", \"pre-processing\", \"cleaning\", etc., \"UL\" is so old school nobody says they're doing it. Learn to recognize when it is used, nonetheless, and the competence you gained today will find more applications than you imagine."
