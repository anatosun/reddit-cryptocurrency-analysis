            "selftext": "A lot of people use centralized exchanges to stake small amount of ETH, but thereby they give them custody over their coins.\n\nThere is actually a very easy way to stake ETH in your own wallet decentralized, without any lockup and with mininal fees of only a few dollars. \n\nIt works through layer 2 Arbitrum and the decentralized staking pool Rocket Pool!\n\nFirst you need to get ETH to your Arbitrum account. Most big centralized exchanges support withdrawals to Arbitrum, for example Binance or Crypto.com. If you have ETH on mainnet, there is also a bridge from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum, but using centralized exchanges to bridge will be cheaper for gas.\n\nYou can now use metamask to access your arbitrum account. [Here](https://help.uniswap.org/en/articles/5538707-how-to-connect-to-arbitrum) is a tutorial on how to connect your metamask to the arbitrum network.\n\nAfter you can access your Arbitrum funds on metamask, there is only one thing left to do: Go to Uniswap and swap your ETH to rETH (Rocket Pool ETH) \n\nYou can do that through this link: [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0xec70dcb4a1efa46b8f2d97c310c9c4790ba5ffa8&chain=arbitrum). (You might have to switch the network to Arbitrum on Uniswap first)\n\nThe swap will only cost around $2 dollars on Arbitrum. So you pay less than $5 total in fees, including the exchange withdrawal.\n\nThe value of rETH will automatically increase over time compared to ETH, because the staking rewards that are earned through staking in Rocket Pool automatically flow into the value of rETH. At the beginning of Rocket Pool, 1 rETH was equal to 1 ETH. Right now, 1 rETH = 1.02 ETH. \n\nIf the staking pool earns 5% staking rewards every year, the rETH/ETH ratio will go up by 5% in the same amount of time. Thats how you earn your staking rewards.\n\nYou can swap your rETH back to ETH at anytime to 'unstake' your ETH.\n\nTo get more information about rocket pool, check out the [official website](https://rocketpool.net/).",

            "selftext": "Hi, I have some eth on the exchange and I'm thinking to move them to a ledger. I would like to low the gas fee of the mainnet by using Arbitrum, which is supported by my exchange but I've some difficulties to understand how these L2 works.\n\nAccording with this video (see the link at the end of the post) , once I transfer Eth from the exchange to the ledger on arbitrum I get AETH on the ledger (min. 13.17). If I want to transform them back in ETH I need to use this Hop Exchange (min. 16.25) and to do this I've to pay the mainnet gas fee.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. how do I save in gas fee by using this process? It seems to me that I'm going to pay more than transferring directly eth with erc20 because first I have to pay arbitrum fee and then to pay Hop erc20 gas fee (which from the video my understanding is that being an erc20 fee its cost will be the same as transferring eth to the ledger on erc20)\n2. the second option would be to keep ETH in the ledger as AETH but...isn't this a less secure asset than the \"real\" Eth? The difference seems to me like to have real gold or paper gold...is this wrong? What if Arbitrum, which is a quite new thing breaks (from the video my uderstanding is that AETH works only on Arbitrum)? Sorry if my question doesn't make sense but I find really hard to get this thing....\n3. Consider that my scope is to accumulate eth by DCA and eventually get some yield. If I move my eth from the exchange to the ledger I would like to use a service like Lido or Rocketpool to generate some yield...so my last question is: can I use these services with AETH, instead of ETH?\n4. the last question is: if I do some mistake in setting up the exchange and the ledger on \"arbitrum mode\" do I loose my eth in the transferring?\n\nThis is the video I was referencing to: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK-OFuPwes&t=987s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK-OFuPwes&t=987s)\n\nThank you in advance!",

Arbitrum makes transactions like swaps and DeFi stuff about 10x. Therefore if you are going to do loads of shenanigans like perpetuals trading, covering your trades with options, lending and borrowing etc etc then you'll very quickly save back the fees that you spent bridging onto the rollup.\n\nIf on the other hand you just want to buy and hold ether there isn't a direct advantage to moving to Arbitrum. There might be indirect advantages though, as lots of economic activity is going to be moving to L2s as time goes on (http://podcast.banklesshq.com/the-trillion-dollar-l2-opportunity-part-one).\n\nWith regards to RocketPool, while you can't use the dApp on an L2, there is liquidity for rETH on DEXs on Arbitrum so you can just swap whatever you like for it.",

It sounds like your exchange already supports Arbitrum withdrawals, in which case you can pretty much just skip the steps in the video and withdraw directly to your ledger on Arbitrum. It works exactly like withdrawing on mainnet, just ~10x cheaper. \n\n2. Technically yes, Arbitrum is operating in a trusted capacity right now with plans to decentralize in the near-ish future. AETH is essentially just the representation of real ETH held by the Arbitrum contracts; it won't lose its value peg to ETH unless the bridge is exploited. There are additional risks here; don't put your entire portfolio on Arbitrum yet. \n\n3. You can buy rETH on Arbitrum Uniswap, yes. I don't think stETH has been deployed there, yet. \n\n4. It depends on the mistake, but really there isn't much to it. As long as you send it to your address and *only* your address, you'll still be able to access the funds somehow. The only way you could lose them is if you sent them to the wrong address.",
