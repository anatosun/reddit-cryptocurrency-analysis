            "selftext": "So, if you will ever store your mnemonic key in a physical paper. I suggest to use this technique. Download an offline QR code generator (I use one from softpedia). Convert each word into a png file which you will then import into a word file table as follows. So what's the idea behind this? Why not just write each word instead? So, each day you check for your paper wallet, if it's in place then you're safe but what if it's stolen? Then you will need to have more time to transfer the funds from your wallet to another one. Storing the words in QR codes guarantees that it's not human readable, the thief must qr code scan each word to be able to unlock the wallet. This should give you some time ahead to transfer the funds (in case you are still alive). Of course I am assuming that the paper is not the only way you store your keys and you have a backup in an ecnrypted password cloud storage service.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/go0cyf7i0ot81.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=73f9fd338d5cf2ef0c65a99a32452e61ca0d3092",

You can't spot when the code has been taken.\n\nMuch better to encapsulate your seed so that the attacker needs to break in to get it. Glue your piece of paper. Put it in an case and glue it. Doesn't matter as soon as the attack has to destroy something you can spot that the seed was taken 100%",

Just like fiat money is a \"scam\" in that sense (centralized, inflatable at will, censorable, favoring those who control the issuance etc)\n\nIt comes down to people not _really_ using Bitcoin, but accepting substitutes. And of course in some cases, thinking the purpose of Bitcoin is number go up in fiat money terms.\n\nThe effective psyop is making people believe that _that_ is using Bitcoin. \"Muh store of value\", \"muh digital gold\", \"muh exchange tokens\".\n\n---\n\nI must point out that in all of the above, the usage of the word 'scam' is far too loose, it's basically pop culture in the cryptosphere, but these are not scams in a stricter sense and a lot of people actually disapprove of applying the term 'scam' too loosely.

In fact I doubt I can find it but I remember reading a Gmax argument a long time ago in which he very clearly pointed out that the block size limit reduces the ability to conduct a bank run (in the context of that being a good thing).  It didn't feel right when I read it but it didn't occur to me until now why that's a bad thing.  After many years I now understand the counterargument.  It will take a while to assimilate it into my thinking, because it is indeed critical. \n\nAlso your handy treatment of LN is extremely salient.  If in fact Bitcoin BTC becomes the world standard settlement system then it becomes prohibitive for almost anyone to run an LN wallet trustlessly.  And even if you could run a trustless wallet, who would you be connecting to and routing through?  *The banking system.*\n\nThanks so much for this.\n\n/u/chaintip",

I understand why you would not want to write \"Bitcoin (BTC)\" in every place where you make this statement in this article, but it would be more correct because the general statement is unproven and Bitcoin (Cash) or some other Bitcoin derived coin might well prove it wrong in future.\n\n__The article is good, but swallowing the small blockers' main premise without labeling it as a hypothesis (or axiom in their case) makes the argument presented against the Bitcoin Standard here seem incomplete to me.__ It could even be just a footnote indicating that this claim against on chain scalability of the protocol is still in dispute.\n\nI'm not even going to cite Satoshi's view on the scalability of the base protocol, they're well known to everyone ;-)\n\nBut let's look at the minimum of 1B people doing 1 cash transactions each per day at ~220b/tx, that requires ~1.5Gb blocks. It's not out of the realm of the possible, quite the contrary. People have run [1GB Bitcoin Cash blocks](https://read.cash/@mtrycz/how-my-rpi4-handles-mining-1gb-blocks-e5d09d83) on a Raspberry Pi on the scaling testnet, not even commodity desktop PC much less server level hardware. Another Bitcoin-derived blockchain has run multi-GB blocks albeit I would not lend my full credence to their methodology as being representative of cash transactions on an open Bitcoin network.\n\nMy point is : blocks of a couple GB are not out of reach by any means. That would accomodate billions of people doing a single tx per day, and strictly speaking, would cover what your article currently claims is not achievable.",
