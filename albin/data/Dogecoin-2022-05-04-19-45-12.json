It was developed as a fork of Luckycoin, which was by itself a fork of Litecoin.\u00a0\n\nLitecoin is a fork of Bitcoin, so we can clearly see the connection here of the cryptocurrency. This is also seen in the fact that the token can also be mined.\u00a0\n\nDespite being the result of a fork, over time, Dogecoin became one of the most popular cryptocurrencies and uses the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism as a means of generating new tokens. What this means is that miners solve cryptographic puzzles as a means of validating the transactions in the network, where they get rewarded in the form of coins.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Dogecoin has many similarities with the Bitcoin blockchain. However, there are no limits in terms of how many Dogecoin tokens can be mined, which gives investors an unlimited ability to trade the token.\n* The DOGE cryptocurrency has been in the crypto space for quite a long period of time and, as such, can be easily transacted and traded on decentralized exchanges, which gives it a high level of availability and compatibility.\n* The Dogecoin project has an amazing community and receives a lot of support from it through a variety of different social media channels.\n* Through NOWNodes, you can easily run a Dogecoin node and get access to on-chain information that you might be interested in having.\u00a0\n\n[As such, if you are curious as to how you can get access to a DOGE node, here is everything that you need to know](https://nownodes.io/blog/running-dogecoin-nodes/), dive in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/804qljwp6hx81.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6fe4bd3af5f7dab17ff8e68dfafd494e6d38d30",

Then set up your modem to port forward with the proper port address and restart dogecoin core.

And I would certainly not utilize it for such a function without much deeper investigation into this now node. Could be a untested custodial system.",
