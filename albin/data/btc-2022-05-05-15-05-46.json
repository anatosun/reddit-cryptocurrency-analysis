You may say \"well it's on sale\", but the other 99% invested in BTC will be crying foul and begging for regulation.\n\nDon't shoot the messenger.

Anyway, that's probably where the incentives get muddled, and perhaps people use reward tokens already instead of directly handing out BCH (thinking of GoCrypto / GOC).\n\nI still think that e-commerce is a key area where BCH can shine and needs to kickstart some payment cycles that evolve into real p2p electronic cash payments and not so much hassle-filled payment gateway experiences.\n\nThoughts?",

One drawback to the usual scheme is that the usual scheme works by binding the customer via the token which is only redeemable at that shop.\n\nBCH would be like that token but also redeemable else were. This could be unimportant as long as there are not many merchants accepting BCH which is exactly the phase this could be applied at.",

This has worked well for me over the years.. giving out some crypto cash back would be a nightmare to implement, completely impossible on shared hosting, and would exclude most merchants unless running a node for each coin in their back end/server, which is extremely uncommon these days.\n\nAlso giving a crypto reward for fiat purchases would be a nightmare as well, unless you had a LOT of crypto to seed the pot with. I've accepted crypto for years on multiples stores and only get at most 10-15% of purchases made in crypto, without giving all my crypto back in rewards it would be impossible, and even then I think I would still run into issues/lack of crypto to pay them.",
